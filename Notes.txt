Created gxdhtclassifier repo in github
Started work on sdGetKnownSamples.py to pull training/test sets from the db.
Need to figure out:
    how to select known "yes"s and "no"s
        Connie's _user_key = 1064
        GXD HT ArrayExpress Load _user_key = 1561
            1257 "no"s have this as "evaluated by"
        the rest, "yes"s and "no"s and a few "maybe"s are "evaluated by" Connie
            9506 no
            3186 yes
              13 maybe
    Initially:
        only take the "connie" ones
        only take GEO experiments. (those w/ GEO IDs)
        Use evaluation_state to define "yes" or "no".
            Don't look at curaton status
    Need to validate these decisions with Connie

select t.term, u._user_key, count(*)
from gxd_htexperiment e join voc_term t on (e._evaluationstate_key = t._term_key)
join mgi_user u on (e._evaluatedby_key = u._user_key)
group by t.term, u._user_key
||
select u.name, count(*)
from gxd_htexperiment e join mgi_user u on (e._evaluatedby_key = u._user_key)
group by u._user_key
||
select t.term, u.name, count(*)
from gxd_htexperiment e join voc_term t on (e._evaluationstate_key = t._term_key)
join mgi_user u on (e._evaluatedby_key = u._user_key)
join acc_accession a on (a._object_key = e._experiment_key and a._mgitype_key = 42 and a._logicaldb_key = 190)
group by t.term, u.name
