To date, the vast majority of these experiments have focused on specific biological processes and perturbations. Here, we have generated and analyzed gene expression from a set of samples spanning a broad range of biological conditions. Specifically, we profiled gene expression from 91 human and mouse samples across a diverse array of tissues, organs, and cell lines. Because these samples predominantly come from the normal physiological state in the human and mouse, this dataset represents a preliminary, but substantial, description of the normal mammalian transcriptome. We have used this dataset to illustrate methods of mining these data, and to reveal insights into molecular and physiological gene function, mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, disease etiology, and comparative genomics. Finally, to allow the scientific community to use this resource, we have built a free and publicly accessible website (http://expression.gnf.org) that integrates data visualization and curation of current gene annotations. .. none;  total RNA;  adipose tissue;  adrenal gland;  amygdala;  bladder;  bone;  bone marrow;  brown fat;  cerebellum;  cortex;  cortex frontal;  digits;  dorsal root ganglion;  epidermis;  eye;  gall bladder;  heart;  hippocampus;  hypothalamus;  kidney;  large intestine;  liver;  lung;  lymph node;  mammary gland;  olfactory bulb;  ovary;  placenta;  prostate;  salivary gland;  skeletal muscle;  small intestine;  snout epidermis;  spinal cord, lower;  spinal cord, upper;  spleen;  stomach;  striatum;  testis;  thymus;  thyroid;  tongue epidermis;  trachea;  trigeminal;  umbilical cord;  uterus;  10090;  Mus musculus;

To investigate the control of barrier formation, we characterized the epidermally expressed Grainyhead-like epithelial transactivator (Get-1)/Grhl3, a conserved mammalian homologue of Grainyhead, which plays important roles in cuticle development in Drosophila. Get-1 interacts with the LIM-only protein LMO4, which is co-expressed in the developing mammalian epidermis. The epidermis of Get-1(-/-) mice showed a severe barrier function defect associated with impaired differentiation of the epidermis, including defects of the stratum corneum, extracellular lipid composition and cell adhesion in the granular layer. The Get-1 mutation affects multiple genes linked to terminal differentiation and barrier function, including most genes of the epidermal differentiation complex. Get-1 therefore directly or indirectly regulates a broad array of epidermal differentiation genes encoding structural proteins, lipid metabolizing enzymes and cell adhesion molecules. Although deletion of the LMO4 gene had no overt consequences for epidermal development, the epidermal terminal differentiation defect in mice deleted for both Get-1 and LMO4 is much more severe than in Get-1(-/-) mice with striking impairment of stratum corneum formation. These findings indicate that the Get-1 and LMO4 genes interact functionally to regulate epidermal terminal differentiation.

Using Klf9 null mutant mice, we have investigated the involvement of Klf9 in small intestine crypt-villus cell renewal and lineage determination.  We report the predominant expression of Klf9 gene in small intestine smooth muscle (muscularis externa).  Jejunums null for Klf9 have shorter villi, reduced crypt stem/transit cell proliferation, and altered lineage determination as indicated by decreased and increased numbers of Goblet and Paneth cells, respectively.  A stimulatory role for Klf9 in villus cell migration was demonstrated by BrdU labeling.  Results suggest that Klf9 controls the elaboration, from small intestine smooth muscle, of molecular mediator(s) of crypt cell proliferation and lineage determination, and of villus cell migration.          Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted in parallel from the jejunums of five WT and five Klf9-/- male mice (PND 30) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).  Conversion of each RNA preparation to corresponding fragmented cRNA.  Fifteen ug of each cRNA was hybridized for 16 hours to an Affymetrix mouse 430A GeneChip.  Ten GeneChips (each corresponding to a single animal) were hybridized, washed and scanned in parallel.

We have determined the regulatory targets of Brn3a in the developing trigeminal ganglion using microarray analysis of Brn3a mutant mice. These results show that Brn3 mediates the coordinated expression of neurotransmitter systems, ion channels, structural components of axons and inter- and intracellular signaling systems. Loss of Brn3a also results in the ectopic expression of transcription factors normally detected in earlier developmental stages and in other areas of the nervous system. Target gene expression is normal in heterozygous mice, consistent with prior work showing that autoregulation by Brn3a results in gene dosage compensation. Detailed examination of the expression of several of these downstream genes reveals that the regulatory role of Brn3a in the trigeminal ganglion appears to be conserved in more posterior sensory ganglia but not in the CNS neurons that express this factor. Experiment Overall Design: Microarrays used to compare the patterns of gene expression in the trigeminal ganglia of Brn3a knockout and wild-type mice.  Embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) was chosen because at this point in development mutant mice exhibit major defects in sensory axon growth, but have yet to undergo the period of extensive sensory neuron death associated with later stages. ..

Yes|GSE1749|Done|Baseline|transcription profiling by array|2018-10-24|106|1430|Transcription profiling of mouse embryo to assess gene expression during preimplantation mouse development|Studies using low-resolution methods to assess gene expression during preimplantation mouse development indicate that changes in gene expression either precede or occur concomitantly with the major morphological transitions, that is, conversion of the oocyte to totipotent 2-cell blastomeres, compaction, and blastocyst formation. Using microarrays, we characterized global changes in gene expression and used Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) to identify biological and molecular processes that accompany and likely underlie these transitions. The analysis confirmed previously described processes or events, but more important, EASE revealed new insights. Response to DNA damage and DNA repair genes are overrepresented in the oocyte compared to 1-cell through blastocyst stages and may reflect the oocyte's response to selective pressures to insure genomic integrity; fertilization results in changes in the transcript profile in the 1-cell embryo that are far greater than previously recognized; and genome activation during 2-cell stage may not be as global and promiscuous as previously proposed, but rather far more selective, with genes involved in transcription and RNA processing being preferentially expressed. These results validate this hypothesis-generating approach by identifying genes involved in critical biological processes that can be the subject of a more traditional hypothesis-driven approach. .. none;  total RNA;  preimplantation mouse embryo;  10090;  Mus musculus;

However, dysferlin deficiency, namely limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Myoshi myopathy, results in skeletal muscle weakness and spares the heart. This dichotomy could be caused by differential regulation of protective mechanisms. Therefore, we compared intra-individual mRNA expression profiles between cardiac and skeletal muscle in dysferlin-deficient SJL/J mice  and normal C57BL/6 mice.

Two mouse models with deficient CPR expression in adults were recently generated in this laboratory: liver-Cpr-null (with liver-specific Cpr deletion) (Gu et al., J. Biol. Chem., 278, 25895-25901, 2003) and Cpr-low (with reduced CPR expression in all organs examined) (Wu et al. J. Pharmacol. Expt. Ther. 312, 35-43, 2005). The phenotypes included a reduced serum cholesterol level and an induction of hepatic P450 in both models, and hepatomegaly and fatty liver in the liver-Cpr-null mouse alone. Our aim was to identify hepatic gene-expression changes related to these phenotypes. Cpr-lox mice, which have normal CPR expression (Wu et al., Genesis, 36, 177-181, 2003.), were used as the control in microarray analysis. A detailed analysis of the gene-expression changes in lipid metabolism and transport pathways revealed potential mechanisms, such as an increased activation of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and a decreased activation of peroxisomal proliferators activated receptor alpha (PPARgamma) by precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis, that underlie common changes (e.g., induction of multiple P450s and inhibition of genes for fatty acids metabolism) in response to CPR-loss in the two mouse models. Moreover, we also uncovered model-specific gene-expression changes, such as the induction of a lipid translocase (CD36 antigen) and the suppression of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1a) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (Acsl1), that are potentially responsible for the severe hepatic lipidosis observed in liver-Cpr-null, but not Cpr-low mice. .. none;  total RNA;  Murine liver;  10090;  Mus musculus;

FC is measured by pairing a mild foot-shock with the surroundings in which the shock was recieved.  Upon being placed back in the context, mice exhibit freezing behavior, which is a species-specific response to fear.  We have previously used selective breeding to produce lines of mice with high or low levels of freezing behavior.  This experiment is a replication of a previous experiment that produced lines of mice with high or low levels of freezing behavior.  These lines derive from different progenitor mouse strains.  We are able to identify alleles that govern the genetic variability for FC by using chromosomal markers in these selected lines.  Using microarrays, we will identify differences in gene expression in two key brain regions: amygdala and hippocampus.  Gene expression differences and data regarding chromosomal regions involved in the behavior will be compared to identify particular genes that are both differentially expressed and whose expression is governed by alleles that fall into critical chromosomal regions.,We will compare gene expresion in the amygdala and hippocampus (brain regions known to be relevant to fear behavior) from the these two lines of mice and to the those in the previous experiment.  Bayesian statistics will be used in an effort to identify gene expression that affects fear behavior.,We hypothesize that selection has acted in part by changing the frequency of alleles that cause differential expression of key genes in the amygdala and hippocampus of our selected lines.  Slective breeding changes the frequency of trait relevand (FC) alleles.  A relevant allele is expected to increas in one selected line and decrease in the oppositely selected line.  Some trait relevant alleles are expected to cause changes in the level of expression at particular genes.,Amygdala and hippocampus will be rapidly dissected out of experimentally naive mice from each line. Naive  mice will be used for expression studies since the behavior of the mice in the FC test can be reliably anticipated due to their lineage. We have practiced these procedures, and can accurately and reproducibly remove these regions in less than 5 minutes. Different mice will be used to collect each brain region, since the dissection of hippocampus disrupts the removal of amygdala. We will collect enough samples from each region to accommodate a total of 6 microarrays per brain region, per line, thus we will use a total of 24 microarrays. We anticipate that a single brain region will be sufficient to for a microarray. However, we propose to utilize three samples per microarray, because this will reduce variability due to environmental factors and due to slight variability in our dissection procedures. Once this tissue is removed, we will isolate RNA for shipment to the Microarray consortium. We will also collect spleens from each subject as a source of genomic DNA, in order to permit direct comparison of genotype and expression phenotypes. Once we have the results of the microarray analysis, we use WebQTL.org to identify the chromosomal locations of alleles that are know to influence the expression of genes for which we have found differential expression. We will then superimpose this information on trait relevant chromosomal regions identified from our selected lines.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type1 is one such disease, caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the novel protein ataxin-1. To faithfully model SCA1 in the mouse, we generated  knock-in mice carrying 154 CAG repeats in the mouse Sca1 locus. These mice reproduced many aspects of the human disease. Despite ubiquitous expression of the mutant protein, they developed slowly progressive selective neurodegeneration , which is most distinct in Purkinje cells and spinal cord. Alterations in gene expression have been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine disease including SCA1, but the changes of gene expression in an authentic disease model have not been characterized. We believe that knowledge of these genes will give insight into the pathophysiology of SCA1 and may ultimately be relevant to the treatment of SCA1.,We will determine gene expression patterns in the cerebellum and forebrain at three different time points.,We propose that the genes whose expression is affected  by mutant ataxin-1 expression are effectors for neuronal dysfunction and neuronal degeneration in the knock-in mice. We also hypothesize the difference in the expression levels of these genes accounts for selective vulnerability of neurons. We will examine three time points: 4 weeks, 11 weeks, and 20 weeks of age. We have shown that the mice developed motor incoordination as revealed  by rotating rod test as early as 5 weeks of age but it was not until 10 weeks that they start showing clear  neurological  phenotype such as clasping.  At each point, we will compare the pattern between the mutant and wild-type littermate. Animals will be prepared and sacrificed by a standard procedure. Cerebellum and spinal cord are the most affected areas whereas forebrain shows less neurodegeneration. Tissue will be rapidly dissected from cerebellum and forebrain, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C until analysis. Tissues will be sent to the centers (as opposed to RNA). We will be providing 9 tissue samples from three litters for each time point to mitigate any expression differences resulting from subtle differences of procedure or environment where the mice grow. .. none;  total RNA;  brain, cerebellum;  brain, forebrain;  10090;  Mus musculus;

This photoperiodic system is implicated in seasonal affective disorders and the season-associated symptoms observed in bipolar disease and schizophrenia. Thyroid-stimulating hormone beta subunit (Tshb), induced in the pars tuberalis (PT), plays a key role in the pathway that regulates animal photoperiodism. However, the upstream inducers of Tshb expression remain unknown. Here we show that late-night light stimulation acutely triggers the Eya3-Six1 pathway, which directly induces Tshb expression. Using melatonin-proficient CBA/N mice, which preserve the photoperiodic Tshb-expression response, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis of the PT under chronic short-day and long-day conditions. These data comprehensively identified long-day and short-day genes, and indicated that late-night light stimulation induces long-day genes. We verified this by advancing and extending the light period by 8 hours, which acutely induced Tshb expression, within one day. In a genome-wide expression analysis under this condition, we searched for candidate upstream genes by looking for expression that preceded Tshb's, and identified Eya3 gene. These results elucidate the comprehensive transcriptional photoperiodic response in the PT, revealing the complex regulation of Tshb expression and unexpectedly rapid response to light changes in the mammalian photoperiodic system. Mice were separated into 2 groups. One group was maintained under the short-day conditions (light: dark = 8 h:16 h, ZT0 = lights on, ZT8 = lights off, 400 lux) and the other was housed under long-day conditions (light:dark = 16 h:8 h, ZT0 = lights on, ZT16 = lights off, 400 lux) for 2 weeks. The PTs of both groups were retrieved every 4 h for 1 day (6 time points for each group), starting at ZT0. For the experiments performed during the first day of the long-day conditions, we applied two different conditions, following 3 weeks under short-day conditions. In one, the light-onset was advanced by 8 hours (advance condition), and in the other, the dark period was delayed by 8 hours (delay condition). PTs from both groups were obtained every 4 h for 1 day, starting at the lights-on time. (Lights on for the advance condition was ZT16 as defined by the short-day condition.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute the largest family of noncoding RNAs involved in gene silencing, and represent critical regulators of cell and tissue differentiation. MicroRNA gene expression profiling is an effective means of acquiring novel and valuable information regarding the expression and regulation of genes, under the control of miRNA, involved in mammalian orofacial development. RESULTS: To identify differentially expressed miRNAs during mammalian orofacial ontogenesis, miRNA expression profiles from gestation day (GD) -12, -13 and -14 murine orofacial tissue were compared utilizing miRXplore microarrays from Miltenyi Biotech GmbH. TaqManTM quantitative Real-Time PCR was utilized for validation of gene expression changes.  Cluster analysis of the microarray data was conducted with the clValid R package and the UPGMA (hierarchical) clustering method.  Functional relationships between selected miRNAs were investigated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Expression of over 26% of the approximately 588 murine miRNA genes examined was detected in murine orofacial tissues from GD 12, 13 and 14.  Among these expressed genes several clusters were seen to be developmentally regulated. Differential expression of genes encoding miRNAs within such clusters were shown to target genes encoding proteins involved in cell proliferation, cell adhesion, differentiation, apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, all processes critical for normal orofacial development. Functional relationships between miRNAs differentially expressed were investigated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity Systems). CONCLUSIONS: Using miRNA microarray technology, unique gene expression signatures of hundreds of miRNAs in embryonic orofacial tissue were defined. Gene targeting and functional analysis revealed that the expression of numerous protein-encoding genes, crucial to normal orofacial ontogeny, may be regulated by specific miRNAs. Time-course experiment (Developmental Stages), ICR mice embryos on gestational days (GD) 12, 13 and 14.

Both a microdeletion and its reciprocal microduplication mapping to mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), which model the rearrangements present in Smith-Magenis (SMS) and Potocki-Lupski (PTLS) syndromes patients, respectively, have been engineered. We profiled the transcriptome of five different tissues affected in human patients in mice with 1n (Deletion/+), 2n (+/+), 3n  (Duplication/+) and uniallelic 2n (Deletion/Duplication) copies of the same region in an identical genetic background. The most differentially expressed transcripts between the four studied genotypes were ranked. A highly significant propensity, are mapping to the engineered SMS/PTLS interval in the different tissues. A statistically significant overrepresentation of the genes mapping to the flanks of the engineered interval was also found in the top-ranked differentially expressed genes. A phenomenon efficient across multiple cell lineages and that extends along the entire length of the chromosome, tens of megabases from the breakpoints. These long-range effects are unidirectional and uncoupled from the number of copies of the copy number variation (CNV) genes. Thus, our results suggest that the assortment of genes mapping to a chromosome is not random. They also indicate that a structural change at a given position of the human genome may cause the same perturbation in particular pathways regardless of gene dosage. An issue that should be considered in appreciating the contribution of this class of variation to phenotypic features.

To clarify the in vivo role of NRX in mammals, we here generate NRX gene-knockout mice (NRX-/- mice) by homologous recombination. NRX-/- mice die around birth. Therefore, we performed microarray analyses with NRX+/+ and NRX-/- embryos of E9.5 and E11.5 stages. Surprisingly, in the genes commonly upregulated at both stages, we could not observe Wnt/beta-catenin targets. Rather, several target genes for Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, such as Frizzled2 and Occludin, are downregulated in NRX-/- whole embryos. Frizzled2 is a gene reportedly expressed in developmental heart. Indeed, by RT-PCR analyses we confirmed that the expression of Frizzled2, as well as other Wnt/beta-catenin target genes, was downregulated in embryonic heart of NRX-/- mice. We also found that the amount of unphosphorylated (i.e. activated) form of beta-catenin was downregulated in NRX-/- embryonic heart. These results reveal that NRX plays another role which was unidentified in culture cell studies; it is required for the maintenance of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity. Total RNAs were extracted from E9.5 and E11.5 embryos derived from NRX+/+ and NRX-/- C57BL/6J mice using RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen).

Many miRNAs are expressed in the developing brain and regulate multiple aspects of neural development including neurogenesis, dendritogenesis and synapse formation. Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2). While Mecp2 is known to act as a global transcriptional regulator, miRNAs that are directly regulated by Mecp2 in the brain are not known.  Using massively parallel sequencing methods, we have identified miRNAs whose expression is altered in cerebella of Mecp2-null mice before and after the onset of severe neurological symptoms.  In vivo genome-wide analyses indicate that promoter regions of a significant fraction of dys-regulated miRNA transcripts, including a large polycistronic cluster of brain-specific miRNAs, are DNA methylated and directly bound by Mecp2. Functional analysis demonstrates that the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNA encoding Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) can be targeted by multiple miRNAs aberrantly up-regulated in absence of Mecp2.  Taken together, these results suggest that dys-regulation of miRNAs may contribute to RTT pathoetiology, and also provide a valuable resource to further investigate the role of miRNAs in RTT. Two pooled total RNA samples (4 pairs of wild-type (WT) and Mecp2-null (KO) male mice; postnatal 6-week, the pre-/early-symptomatic stage) were sequenced in a multiplexed configuration (with distinct barcode sequences).

However, to date, there is no established molecular explanation for the age-dependent increases in these pathologies. The prostate is comprised of a functional secretory epithelium supported by a spectrum of cell types and structural elements comprising the stroma. As reciprocal interactions between epithelium and stromal constituents are essential for normal organogenesis and serve to maintain normal functions, discordance within the stromal could permit or promote disease processes. In this study we sought to identify aging-associated alterations in the mouse prostate that could influence pathology. We quantitated transcript levels in microdissected periglandular stroma from young (4 month-old) and old (20-24 month-old) C57BL/6 mice, and identified a significant change in the expression of 1259 genes (p<0.05). These included increases in transcripts encoding genes associated with inflammation (e.g., Ccl8, Ccl12), genotoxic/ oxidative stress (e.g., Apod, Serpinb5) and paracrine-acting proteins (e.g., Cyr61). The expression of several collagen genes (e.g., Col1a1 and Col3a1) exhibited age associated declines. By immunofluorescence and electron microscopy we determined that the aged prostate contains an abundant disorganized collagen matrix and a significant increase in inflammatory infiltrates comprised of macrophages, T cells and, to a lesser extent, B cells. These findings demonstrated that during normal aging the prostate stroma exhibits phenotypic and molecular characteristics plausibly contributing to the striking age associated pathologies affecting the prostate through oxidative stress and inflammatory cell damage.

Adamts20 mutations cause the mouse white spotting mutant belted (bt), whereas Adamts9 is essential for survival beyond 7.5 days of gestation (E7.5). Functional overlap of Adamts9 with Adamts20 was established in bt/bt:Adamts9+/- mice, which have increased white spotting relative to bt mice, as previously reported, and a fully penetrant cleft palate. Palatal closure was delayed, although eventually completed, in both bt/+;Adamts9+/- and bt/bt mice, demonstrating a cooperative role of these related genes. Adamts9 and Adamts20 are both expressed in palatal mesenchyme, with Adamts9 expressed exclusively in microvascular endothelial cells. Palatal shelves from bt/bt:Adamts9+/- mice fused in culture, suggesting an intact TGFbeta signaling pathway in palatal epithelium, and indicating a temporally specific delay in palatal shelf elevation and growth toward the midline. Palatal shelf mesenchymal cells showed a statistically significant decrease of cell proliferation at E13.5 and E14.5, as well as decreased processing of versican, an ADAMTS substrate, at these stages. Vcan haploinsufficiency led to a greater penetrance of cleft palate in bt mice, and impaired proliferation was also seen in palatal mesenchymal cells of these mice, suggesting a role for ADAMTS-mediated versican proteolysis in palatal closure. In a parallel with recent work identifying a role for a bioactive ADAMTS-generated versican fragment in regulating apoptosis during interdigital web regression, we propose that versican proteolysis may influence palatal mesenchymal cell proliferation. Palatal shelves were dissected from four E13.75 Adamts9+/-:bt/bt embyos (correspond to the 4 samples: Palate_Adamts9+/-:bt/bt_Rep1, Palate_Adamts9+/-:bt/bt_Rep2, Palate_Adamts9+/-:bt/bt_Rep3 and Palate_Adamts9+/-:bt/bt_Rep4) and age-matched 3 wild-type C57Bl/6 embryos (correspond to the 3 samples: Palate_WT_Rep1, Palate_WT_Rep2, and Palate_WT_Rep3) that were used as the controls ..

To improve understanding of natural sense-antisense transcription, we performed comparative expression profiling of SATs conserved among humans and mice. Using custom oligo-arrays loaded with probes that represented SATs with both protein-coding and non-protein-coding transcripts, we showed that 33% of the 291 conserved SATs displayed identical expression patterns in the two species. Among these SATs, expressional balance inversion of sense-antisense genes was mostly observed in testis at a tissue-specific manner. Northern analyses of the individual conserved SAT loci revealed that: (1) a smeary hybridization pattern was present in mice, but not in humans, and (2) small RNAs (about 60 to 80 nt) were detected from the exon-overlapping regions of SAT loci. In addition, further analyses showed marked alteration of sense-antisense expression balance throughout spermatogenesis in testis. These results suggest that conserved SAT loci are rich in potential regulatory roles that will help us understand this new class of transcripts underlying the mammalian genome. Keywords: Expression profile of mouse and human sense-antisense transcript  The RNA samples used for the mouse oligo-array experiments came from the brain, NIH3T3 cells (fibroblast cell line), liver, heart, and testis. RNA from mouse tissue (C57BL/6J, 8 to 10 weeks, male and female mixed) and mouse fibroblast line NIH3T3 was isolated by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The mouse custom oligo DNA microarray chip (microarray format: 11K) contained 3896 probes that represented genes in 1948 exon-overlapping SAT (sense-antisense transcript) pairs.The same total RNA samples were reciprocally labeled with Cy3 or Cy5, hybridized to the oligo DNA on the chip, and dye-normalized. The data on all genes on the chip were used to enable the Feature Extraction software to produce the processed signals. The total mean signal on the mouse chip in each hybridization experiment was adjusted with to a value of 4872.3. The RNA samples used for human microarray experiments came from brain, HF19 cells (fibroblast cell line), heart, liver and testis. The total brain, heart, and testis RNA used in the array experiments was purchased from Ambion. Total RNA was isolated from the fibroblast cells by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The same total RNA samples were labeled with single color Cy3, hybridized to the oligo DNA on the chip, and dye-normalized; the processed signals were obtained by using Feature Extraction software (Agilent Technologies). The custom oligo DNA microarray chip (microarray format: 11K) contained 2793 probes for 1486 pairs of exon-overlapping SATs. The data on all genes on the chip were used to enable the Feature Extraction software to produce the processed signals. For further analysis, the Cy3-labeled processed signal was used as the processed signal from the expression of a particular gene. The total mean signal on the human chip in each hybridization experiment was adjusted to 1491.6, so that the relative differences in gene expression could be compared among cell lines and tissues. ..

Because molecular machines control mRNA levels of multiple genes, we expect genetic variation in components of these machines would influence multiple genes in a similar fashion. We show that this assumption is correct by using correlation of mRNA levels measured from multiple tissues in mouse strain panels to detect shared genetic influences. These correlating groups of genes (CGGs) have collective properties that on average account for 52-79% of the variability of their constituent genes and can contain genes that encode functionally related proteins. We show that the genetic influences are essentially tissue-specific and, consequently, the same genetic variations in one animal may upregulate a CGG in one tissue but downregulate the CGG in a second tissue. We further show similarly paradoxical behaviour of CGGs within the same tissues of different individuals. Thus, this class of genetic variation can result in complex inter- and intra-individual differences. This will create substantial challenges in humans, where multiple tissues are not readily available. Each sample is a single hybridisation from a given BxD strain to a C57BL/6J reference sample.

Unfortunately, the quality of samples stored in tissue banks is variable due to heterogeneity in pre-analytical preparation of clinical specimens. Collectively, these variables will impact the reliability of the results of the analysis. To date no systematic studies have been performed to investigate the relationship between total RNA degradation and miRNA profiles determined from snap-frozen collections or freshly harvested tissues. To investigate this question, we compared miRNA expression profiles generated through delaying the extraction of RNA from liver and duodenum, to generate different RNA integrities as defined by RIN values. Duodenum samples were collected from mice, sliced into five identical pieces, transfered into eppendorf tubes and either processed immediately (T0) or maintained on ice and at latter time points [30 min (T30), 60 min (T60), 120 min (T120) and 240 min (T240)]. RNA was extracted by using Trizol and RNA integrity was assessed by Bioanalyzer electropherograms. We found that duodenal samples (which are rich in RNases) do show high susceptibility to degradation. These findings suggest that tissues such as duodenum or pancreas should either be processed immediately or snap-frozen and processed individually. miRNA expression profiling by microarray shows that miRNAs from freshly harvested duodenum are extensively degraded. Based on these data, we conclude that samples with low RIN values (less than 7) do not merit analysis on miRNA arrays. .. total RNA;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T0 replica A;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T0 replica B;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T120 minutes;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T240 minutes;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T30 minutes;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T60 minutes;  C57Bl/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  duodenum;  A total of 3 female mice on the C57BL/6J genetic background were used for this experiment.

Accordingly, numerous methods have been established to identify and quantify miRNAs. The shortness of miRNA sequence results in a high dynamic range of melting temperatures and, moreover, impedes a proper selection of detection probes or optimized PCR primers. While miRNA microarrays allow for massive parallel and accurate relative measurement of all known miRNAs, they have so far been less useful as an assay for absolute quantification. Here, we present a microarray based approach for global and absolute quantification of miRNAs. The method relies on an equimolar pool of about 1000 synthetic miRNAs of known concentration which is used as an universal reference and labeled and hybridized in a dual colour approach on the same array as the sample of interest. Each single miRNA is quantified with respect to the universal reference outbalancing bias related to sequence, labeling, hybridization or signal detection method. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by various spike in experiments. Further, we quantified miRNA copy numbers in liver samples and CD34(+)CD133(-) hematopoietic stem cells.  Total liver RNA was mixed with 2.5 fmol of each of 18 RNA oligonucleotides reverse complement to miRControl 3 probes and subsequently fluorescently labelled by 3' ligation. Total RNA mix was hybridized in a dual colour approach to microarrays versus a second labelled synthetic miRNA pool (n = 6). The synthetic miRNA pool consisted of 2.5 fmol of each of  891 non redundant miRNAs sequences and miRControl 3 sequences. The array data was normalized by calculating the median of the miRControl 3 present in the liver and UR sample.

This study focuses on miRNAs that are expressed in the mouse cochlea and vestibule, the two inner ear compartments. To identify miRNAs that are expressed in the vertebrate developing inner ear, we used miRNA microarrays. Similar miRNA profiles were found in newborn (P0) mouse whole cochleae and vestibules. 105 miRNAs were found to be expressed in the whole P0 cochlea and 114 miRNAs expressed in the whole P0 vestibule with average intensities higher than twice the global background, out of 206 included in the arrays. Only 24 miRNAs were found to have different levels of expression in these whole organs, and these differences were mild (15-40%). The microarray results were intersected with two bioinformatic complementary approaches in order to choose candidate miRNAs that are predicted to be expressed specifically in the inner ear sensory epithelia (see the paper).  Six small (<40 nt) RNA samples were hybridized with 4 microarrays (to save costs, some of the microarrays were hybridized with two different samples, labeled with different CyDyes     Cy3 and Cy5). Each RNA sample contains small RNAs (<40 nt) pooled from at least 20 newborn cochleae or vestibules, and there are 3 different samples for each organ. However, one of the samples (WT_P0_whole_Cochlea_3_V4) was hybridized with a different array than the other samples (printed from the same probes, but at a different date), and therefore excluded from the analysis described in the paper.  Each microarray contains at least 4 identical spots per each probe that may be considered as technical replicates. Four of the samples were hybridized in parallel at the same day to two microarrays, and the dyes were swaped: First microarray: WT_P0_whole_Cochlea_1 (Cy3) [GSM388075] and WT_P0_whole_Vestibule_2 (Cy5) [GSM388635]; second microarray: WT_P0_whole_Cochlea_2 (Cy5) [GSM388633] and WT_P0_whole_Vestibule_1 (Cy3) [GSM388634]. The other 2 samples: WT_P0_whole_Vestibule_3 (Cy3) [GSM388637] and WT_P0_whole_Cochlea_3_V4 (Cy3) [GSM388660] were hybridized to two individual microarrays, at different dates.

Positive control probes (labeled as    control 1    in raw data) were added to RNA samples before labeling. The average of empty and buffer spots was used to calculate the global background of each array, and only miRNAs with an average expression higher than twice the fold of the array global background at least in one of the tissues were considered as expressed. ..

We performed a total of 8 microarray experiments using Affymetrix MG-U74Av2 chips, including 2 biological and 2 experimental replicates per genotype sample.  Due to limiting RNA yields from the newborn inner ear, each microarray chip was hybridized with an RNA pool from multiple tissue samples. We analyzed our data using two different algorithms: GC-Robust Multi-Array (GCRMA) and dChip.  Each normalized expression dataset was subsequently analyzed by 2-way ANOVA, evaluating both genotype and experimental effects.  This statistical approach allowed us to 1) account for an experimental effect observed in the expression value of many genes, therefore increasing the power of the analysis, and 2) filter out potential expression differences due to contamination during dissections (contaminating genes would present as probes with a significant interaction p-value).  Using this methodology, the gene hits from the GCRMA-normalized expression dataset consisted of 256 genes with a significant genotype effect (p<0.01) and no interaction (p>0.01).  Similar cutoffs applied on the dChip-normalized dataset resulted in 250 significant gene hits.  Within both groups, COUP-TFI has the lowest genotype p-value, validating our statistical approach. ..

Type I collagens are predominantly enriched in bone, cartilage, skin, tendons, and eye (i.e. in major fibrous tissues) making up the main extracellular matrix (ECM) component for support and scaffolding purposes. Col1a1 is known to be expressed in the embryo (E9.5; Northern dot blot), perioptic mesenchyme (E11), cornea (E11), skeleton (E14.5), brain meninges (E14.5), and cartilage (E14.5) at relatively early stages. Most evidence of type I collagen function is coupled to the latter stages of skeletal development, thus bypassing the major events of axis formation, tissue differentiation, and mesenchlymal-epithial interactions, for example, that are more symbolic of morphogens and growth factors. Members of the integrin cell surface receptor family of molecules mediate cell adhesion to ECM proteins such as collagen (mainly to type IV basement membrane collagen that forms into a polygonal meshwork), fibronectin, and laminin implicated in wound healing and inflammatory responses (e.g. Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis) in connective tissues. There is some evidence for protein-protein interactions between leukocyte-associated integrins and the interstitial matrix in promoting the migration and/or activation of extravasated leukocytes (e.g., T cells and monocytes) within the perivascular compartment, an ECM-rich environment. This region is surmised to be an important location where certain human leukocytes undergo differentiation (e.g. monocytes) and activation (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes) upon extravascular migration. The von Willebrand factor (vWF), type C motif is found in various plasma proteins like complement factors, the integrins, collagen types, and other extracellular proteins. Thus, the majority of vWF-containing proteins are extracellular and a common feature appears to be involvement in multi protein complexes participating in numerous biological events (e.g. cell adhesion, migration, homing, pattern formation, and signal transduction). Three organs (lung, heart and bone) of 5 AGA002 mutant mice (age 2x 10 days and 3x 11 days) were analysed by cDNA microarray technology.

In order to study the role of telomere shortening in vivo, we studied the phenotype of telomerase deficient mice caused by absence of telomerase RNA component (TERC-/-).  TERC-/- exhibited accelerated age-related bone loss starting at 3 months of age and during 12 months follow up. Bone histomorphometry revealed decreased mineralized surface and bone formation rate as well as increased osteoclast number and size in TERC-/-. Also, serum total deoxy-pyridinoline (tDPD) was increased in TERC-/-. MSC isolated from TERC-/-  exhibited intrinsic defects with reduced total number, lower proliferation rate, decreased expression of osteoblastic (OB) differentiation markers and  formed less in vivo ectopic bone compared to WT cells. The TERC-/--MSC cultures accumulated a larger proportion of senescent beta-galactosidase+ cells and cells exhibiting DNA damage positive for gamma-H2AX. Micro-array analysis of bones of TERC-/- and WT revealed significant over-expression of a large number of pro-inflammatory genes and signaling pathways in TERC-/- known to control osteoclast (OC) differentiation. In accordance with that, serum from TERC-/- enhanced OC formation in control bone marrow cultures. Our data demonstrate two mechanisms for age-related bone loss caused by telomerase deficiency: intrinsic osteoblastic defects and creation of pro-inflammatory osteoclast-activating microenvironment. Approaches for re-telomerization of MSC may provide a novel approach for abolishing age-related bone loss. control (WT) and the test (G3 - mTERC-/-) samples .. 22 wk;  Female;  C57BL/6;  TERC+/+;  TERC-/-;  total RNA;  Mouse tibia bone;  10090;  Mus musculus;  bone;  __untreated;

Since the mice suffered from anophthalmia or microphthalmia, we referred to this new mutant as eyeless (provisional gene symbol: eyl). The mutation follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and was mapped to chromosome 19 close to Pitx3; complementation tests confirmed that eyl is an allelic variant of aphakia (gene symbol: ak). Sequence analysis of the Pitx3 gene identified an insertion of a G in exon 4 (after cDNA position 416: 416insG). The altered open reading frame is predicted to result in a hybrid protein still containing the Pitx3 homeobox, but 121 new amino acids instead of the OAR domain at its C-terminal part. The new Pitx3eyl allele shares the ophthalmological and brain defects of the aphakia mouse including the loss of dopamine transporter 1 transcripts in the midbrain. Moreover, we observed in the mutants an increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, and frequently also hepatosteatosis, combined with a reduced body weight. Fat mass, fat content and subcutaneous fat are significantly decreased in females, but not in males. Additionally, we observed a broad spectrum of behavioural changes in the homozygous mutants including reduced forelimb grip strength and increased nociception. In addition to these alterations being apparent in both sexes, we observed in female Pitx3eyl-/- mice increased anxiety, reduced locomotor activity, reduced object exploration and increased social contacts, but decreased anxiety and increased arousal in males.  Most of these defects identified in the new Pitx3 mutation can also be observed in Parkinson patients. Therefore, the Pitx3eyl mutant is a valuable new model, because it is the first mutant mouse line carrying a point mutation within the coding region of the Pitx3 gene. 5 male animals, 5 experiments including 2 dye swap hybridisations .. 17 weeks;  male;  total RNA;  pool of 4 wildtype mice;  Wt RNA pool;  mouse ID 30000000;  mouse ID 30000001;  mouse ID 30000002;  mouse ID 30000998;  mouse ID 30000999;  wt pool;  Pitx3eyl-/-;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;

Many members of the PDI family are expressed in mammals but the roles of specific PDIs in vivo are poorly understood. A recent homology-based search for additional PDI family members identified anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2), a protein originally presumed to be secreted by intestinal epithelial cells, but the function of AGR2 has been obscure. Here we show that AGR2 is expressed in the ER of secretory cells and is essential for in vivo production of intestinal mucin, a large cysteine-rich glycoprotein that forms the protective mucus gel lining the intestine. A cysteine residue within the AGR2 thioredoxin-like domain forms mixed disulfide bonds with MUC2, consistent with a direct role for AGR2 in mucin processing. Despite a complete absence of intestinal mucin, mice lacking AGR2 appeared healthy but were highly susceptible to dextran sodium sulfate-induced experimental colitis, indicating a critical role for AGR2 in protection from environmental insults. We conclude that AGR2 is a unique member of the PDI family that has a specialized and non-redundant role in intestinal mucus production.  Keywords: small intestine and colon gene expression profiles for Agr2-/- and littermate control mice DNA miocroarrays were used to analyze small intenstine and colon mRNA expression of AGR2 KO and littermate control mice.

In animal models, Foxl2 is required for maintenance, and possibly induction, of female sex determination independently of other critical genes, i.e., Rspo1 and Wnt4. Here we report expression profiling of mouse ovaries that lack Foxl2 alone or in combination with Wnt4 or Kit/c-Kit, to identify ovarian targets of Foxl2 that, along with some testis genes, were dysregulated during embryonic development. Loss of one copy of Foxl2 revealed strong gene dosage sensitivity, with molecular anomalies that were milder but resembled ovaries lacking both Foxl2 alleles. Furthermore, a Foxl2 transgene disrupted embryonic testis differentiation and increased the levels of key female markers. The results, including a comprehensive principal component analysis of published microarray datasets 1) support the proposal of dose-dependent Foxl2 function and anti-testis action throughout ovary differentiation; and 2) identify candidate genes for a role in sex determination independent of FOXL2 (notably, the transcription factor, ZBTB7C) and in the generation of the ovarian reserve downstream of it (e.g., the cadherin-domain protein CLSTN2, or the sphingomyelin synthase, SGMS2). The gene inventory provides a framework to analyze the genetic bases of ovarian development and female fertility.

To initiate analyses, we compared the model of Eda mutant Tabby mice, in which sweat glands were not formed, to wild-type mice.  We inferred developmental stages and critical genes based on observations at 7 time points spanning embryonic, postnatal and adult life. In wild-type footpads, sweat gland germs were detected at E17.5. The coiling of secretory portions started at postnatal day 1 (P1), and sweat gland formation was essentially complete by P5. Consistent with a controlled morphological progression, expression profiling revealed stage-specific gene expression changes. Similar to the development of hair follicles     the other major skin appendage controlled by EDA     sweat gland induction and initial progression was accompanied by Eda-dependent up-regulation of the Shh pathway. During the further development of sweat gland secretory portions, Foxa1 and Foxi1, not at all expressed in hair follicles, were progressively up-regulated in wild-type but not in Tabby footpads. Upon completion of wild-type development, Shh declined to Tabby levels, but Fox family genes remained at elevated levels in mature sweat glands.

To understand the role DNA methylation in CNS neurons, we generated conditional Dnmt1 mutant mice that possess ~90% hypomethylated cortical and hippocampal cells in the dorsal forebrain from E13.5 on.   The mutant mice were viable with a normal lifespan, but displayed severe neuronal cell death between E14.5 to 3-weeks postnatally.   Accompanied with the striking cortical and hippocampal degeneration, adult mutant mice exhibited neurobehavioral defects in learning and memory in adulthood.  Unexpectedly, a fraction of Dnmt1-/- cortical neurons survived through postnatal development, so that the residual cortex in mutant mice contained 20-30% of hypomethylated neurons throughout the life.  Hypomethylated excitatory neurons exhibited multiple defects in postnatal maturation including abnormal dendritic arborization and impaired neuronal excitability.  The mutant phenotypes are coupled with deregulation of those genes involved in neuronal layer-specification, cell death, and the function of ion channels.  Our results suggest that DNA methylation, through its role in modulating neuronal gene expression, plays multiple roles in regulating cell survival, neuronal migration and maturation in the CNS. Experiment Overall Design: We compared gene expression patterns in Wildtype and DNA methylation deficient (Emx1-cre; Dnmt1 mutant) mouse dorsal cortex.

Hypercholesterolemic APOE-deficient mice were used as a standard model of atherosclerosis to study gene expression changes during atherosclerosis treatment with the ACE inhibitor captopril. Microarray analysis was performed of whole aortas isolated from captopril-treated APOE-deficient mice relative to untreated APOE-deficient mice with overt atherosclerosis, and nontransgenic control mice. Microarray gene expression profiling revealed that captopril-mediated atherosclerosis prevention involved inhibition of aorta-infiltrating immune cells such as pro-atherogenic T lymphocytes and macrophages. Experiment Overall Design: Microarray gene expression profiling was performed of whole aortas isolated from APOE-deficient mice with atherosclerosis relative to captopril-treated APOE-deficient mice, and nontransgenic control mice. Three study groups were analyzed, i.e. 8-months-old untreated APOE-deficient mice with overt atherosclerosis, age-matched APOE-deficient mice treated for 7 months with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (20 mg/kg in drinking water), and nontransgenic control C57BL/6J mice.

NCAM-deficient mice exhibit deficits in long-term potentiation and spatial learning, as well as increased intermale aggression. We performed a microarray analysis of adult NCAM-deficient mouse brains to identify molecular targets which might underly the phenotype of NCAM-deficient mice. We analyzed the gene expression profiles in 2-3 months old (young adult) mouse brains, with both the Ncam-/- and the Ncam+/+ group consisting of three individuals each.

Yes|GSE15832|Done|Baseline|transcription profiling by array|2018-04-06|23|2181|Microarray probe design|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in many different cellular, developmental, and physiological processes. Accordingly, numerous methods have been established to identify and quantify miRNAs. The shortness of miRNA sequence results in a high dynamic range of melting temperatures and, moreover, impedes a proper selection of detection probes or optimized PCR primers. While miRNA microarrays allow for massive parallel and accurate relative measurement of all known miRNAs, they have so far been less useful as an assay for absolute quantification. Here, we present a microarray based approach for global and absolute quantification of miRNAs. The method relies on an equimolar pool of about 1000 synthetic miRNAs of known concentration which is used as an universal reference and labeled and hybridized in a dual colour approach on the same array as the sample of interest. Each single miRNA is quantified with respect to the universal reference outbalancing bias related to sequence, labeling, hybridization or signal detection method. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by various spike in experiments. Further, we quantified miRNA copy numbers in liver samples and CD34(+)CD133(-) hematopoietic stem cells. Different probe designs were investigated with respect to sensitivity and selectivity of microarray hybridization. An array with 11 different variants of oligonucleotides for miR-122a and miR-16 was produced. 5   g of respective total RNA was fluorescently labelled by 3' ligation. Total RNA was hybridized in a dual colour approach to microarrays versus a second labelled synthetic miRNA pool. The synthetic miRNA pool consisted of 5 fmol of each of  816 non redundant miRNAs sequences and miRControl 3 sequences.  Local background was subtracted from the signal to obtain the net signal intensity and the mean of the net signal intensities of 4 corresponding spots representing the same miRNA was computed for those spots only which were unflagged (empty spots, poor spots, negative spots) and for which the fluorescent intensity of the miRNAs derived from the samples of interest was two-fold the mean background value (2bkg dataset). .. synthetic miRNA;  8 weeks;  female;  total RNA;  liver;  synthetic miRNA pool (miRXploreTM Universal Reference, Miltenyi Biotec);  CD1;  10090;  32630;  Mus musculus;  synthetic construct;  liver;  WT;

Remarkably, the epithelial boundary between these two organs is literally one cell thick. This discrete junction is established suddenly and precisely at embryonic day (E) 16.5, by sharpening a previously diffuse intermediate zone. In the present study, we define the dynamic transcriptome of stomach, pylorus and intestinal tissues between E14.5 and E16.5. We show that establishment of this boundary is concomitant with the induction of over a thousand genes in intestinal epithelium, and these gene products provide intestinal character. Hence, we call this process intestinalization. We identify specific transcription factors (Hnf4g, Creb3l3 and Tcfec) and examine signaling pathways (Hedgehog and Wnt) that may play a role in this process. Finally, we define a unique expression domain at the pylorus itself and detect novel pylorus-specific patterns for the transcription factor Gata3 and the secreted protein nephrocan. Experiment Overall Design: Stomach, pylorus and duodenum tissue from E14.5 and E16.5 mouse embryos were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Embryos thus obtained were cultured in a two-step culture system (Sage/Biopharma, CT) in micro-drops at 37? C and 5% CO2 under oil (Sage, CT) as described previously.  Embryos from each stage were segregated into three groups.  Each group was considered to be a biologic replicate: embryos within each replicate were pooled for further analysis.  The blastocyst embryos were graded according to the Gardner scale. Mouse embryos: Briefly, female mice were impregnated, and embryos were flushed from the oviducts.  Individual embryos were morphologically staged by light microscopy.  Bovine embryos: Ovaries were washed and 2-6 mm follicles were aspirated.  Only oocytes surrounded by several cell layers of dense cumulus were selected for culture.  Oocytes were washed three times in TL-HEPES (0.22mM sodium pyruvate, 3mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4), and we placed maturation media that had been equilibrated in 5% carbon dioxide and air (39?C, high humidity).  The maturation medium consisted of TC199 supplemented with 3ml of bovine LH and FSH (Sioux Biochemical), 0.25mM sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal calf serum.  After 20 hours of incubation in maturation media, oocytes were removed, washed in TL-HEPES and  placed in groups of 10 oocytes each into 44 ?l microdrops of IVF-Talp (Biowhittaker, Walkersburg, MD) supplemented with 0.22mM sodium pyruvate, and 6 mg/ml essentially fatty acid-free BSA. Live sperm were separated by centrifugation in a percoll gradient (Sigma, P1985).  Eggs were fertilized by adding one million/ml of sperm,  2.0?g heparin (Sigma H-3125), pencillamine, hypotaurine and epinephrine (Sigma-P-4875, H-1384, E-4250) to each drop of fertilization media. Oocytes were removed from the fertilization media after 18-22 hours, washed in TL-HEPES, placed in a 1.5 ml tube, and vortexed for 2 min to remove cumulus cells. Twenty-five cumulus-free oocytes were placed in each 50?l drop of SOF culture medium, supplemented with 8 mg/ml of fatty acid-free BSA, nonessential and essential amino acids and pyruvate. The IVF conditions were optimized for each species. To minimize the influence of IVF conditions to cross-species comparison, we subsequently based the comparisons on either relative expression changes or co-expression patterns.;

To further investigate the molecular organization of the adult mammalian brain, we have built a gene expression-based brain map. We measured gene expression patterns for 24 neural tissues covering the mouse central nervous system and found, surprisingly, that the adult brain bears a transcriptional imprint" consistent with both embryological origins and classic evolutionary relationships. Embryonic cellular position along the anterior-posterior axis of the neural tube was shown to be closely associated with, and possibly a determinant of, the gene expression patterns in adult structures. We also observed a significant number of embryonic patterning and homeobox genes with region-specific expression in the adult nervous system. The relationships between global expression patterns for different anatomical regions and the nature of the observed region-specific genes suggest that the adult brain retains a degree of overall gene expression established during embryogenesis that is important for regional specificity and the functional relationships between regions in the adult.

Together, these form a pathway that represses transposable elements, thus safeguarding germ cell genomes.  While basic models describe the operation of piRNA pathways, neither the protein compositions of Piwi complexes, the critical protein-protein interactions that drive small RNA production and target recognition, or the precise molecular consequences of conserved localization to germline structures, call nuage, is well understood. We purified the three murine Piwi family proteins, Mili, Miwi, and Miwi2, from mouse germ cells and characterized their interacting protein partners.  Piwi proteins were found in complex with Prmt5/Wdr77, an enzyme that di-methylates arginine residues.  By immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies and by mass spectrometry, we found that Piwi proteins are arginine methylated at conserved positions in their amino termini.  These modifications are essential to direct complex formation with specific Tudor-domain proteins, whose interactions with Piwis can be required for localization of RNP complexes in cytoplasmic nuage, proper piRNA expression, and transposon silencing.  Considered together, our findings indicate that arginine methylation drives the assembly of multi-protein machines whose integrity and specific sub-cellular localization is necessary for efficient function of the piRNA pathway.

Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes. To gain molecular understanding of the the hair cycle delay in Clock mutant mice, we profiled the dorsal skin of Clock mutant and their wild-type littermates at P23. At P23, the skin samples are comparable because all the samples are in telogen just prior to the hair cycle delay was observed. Histological sections were used to classify each sample into specific stage of the hair growth cycle based on established morphological guidelines.

To identify new genes involved in feeding behavior and body weight regulation we performed an expression profiling in the hypothalamus of the anx/anx mice. Using commercial microarrays we detected 156 differentially expressed genes and validated 92 of those using TaqMan low-density arrays. Our results showed an enrichment of deregulated genes involved in cell death, cell morphology and cancer as well as an alteration of several signaling circuits involved in energy balance including neuropeptide Y and melanocortin signaling. The expression profile along with the phenotype let us to conclude that anx/anx mice resemble the anorexia-cachexia syndrome typically observed in cancer, infection with human immunodeficiency virus or chronic diseases rather than starvation, and that anx/anx mice could be considered a good model for the treatment and investigation of this condition.

Nuclear factor I-A (NFI-A), a phylogenetically conserved transcription/replication protein, plays a crucial role in mouse brain development. Previous studies showed that disruption of the Nfia gene in mice leads to perinatal lethality, corpus callosum agenesis, and hydrocephalus.  Results. To identify potential NFI-A target genes involved in the observed tissue malformations, we analyzed gene expression in brains from NFI-A-deficient and wild-type littermate control mice at the mRNA level using oligonucleotide microarrays. In young postnatal animals (P16), 356 genes were detected as differentially regulated, whereas at the late embryonic stage (E18), only 5 dysregulated genes were found. An in silico analysis identified phylogenetically conserved NFI binding sites in at least 70 of the differentially regulated genes. Moreover, assignment of gene function showed that marker genes for immature neural cells and neural precursors were expressed at elevated levels in young postnatal NFI-A mutants. By contrast, marker genes for differentiated neural cells were down-regulated at this stage. In particular, genes relevant for oligodendrocyte differentiation were affected. Conclusions. Our results suggest that a delay in early postnatal development, especially oligodendrocyte maturation, is exhibited by NFI-A knock-out mice, and at least partly accounts for their phenotype. The identification of potential NFI-A target genes by our study should both help to elucidate NFI-A-dependent transcriptional pathways and contribute to a better understanding of this period of brain formation, especially with regard to the function of NFI-A. Material and method; Animals; NFI-A-deficient mice were bred and maintained as described [20]. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 at embryonic stage E18.5 (E18) or postnatal day 16 (P16). Brains were dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.  The respective KO and WT animals used for analysis at E18 and P16 were littermates. Only male mice were used. All of the animals were F1 hybrids of C57Bl/6 and 129S6 animals. Within these matings, males had a B6 and females had a 129S6 background. In a large scale test, 38.5% of the offspring survive until P30 using this kind of mating. In purebred B6, we observed 0% survival at P1 (R.M.G., unpublished observations). All animal use was performed under the approved protocol BCH05082N (RMG) of the University at Buffalo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in the UB Laboratory Animal Facility, an AAALAC licensed facility. RNA preparation; Total RNA was extracted from the entire brain of NF-I-A-deficient and wild-type control mice (n=3 each) using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Further purification of RNA was performed with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer at 260 nm and 280 nm wavelength. To check RNA integrity, total RNA was separated in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and the intensity ratio of 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA bands was assessed after ethidium bromide staining.  Microarray hybridization and signal detection; Procedures for cDNA synthesis, labeling and hybridization were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix). All experiments were performed using Affymetrix mouse genome Genechip U74A version 2. Briefly, 15mg of total RNA were used for first strand cDNA synthesis with an HPLC-purified T7-(dT)24 primer. Synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA was carried out using the ENZO RNA transcript labeling kit (Affymetrix). For hybridization, 15  g of fragmented cRNA were incubated with the chip in 200  l of hybridization solution in Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix) at 45oC for 16 hours. Genechips were washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin using the microfluidic workstation (Affymetrix) and scanned with a laser scanner (Agilent Technologies).  Microarray quantification and statistical analysis; Quality controls were performed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0) software. Data and statistical analysis and data visualization were performed with GeneSpring (Agilent Technologies). Expression values were extracted from the CEL file, and imported to GeneSpring using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) for further analysis [24]. Two criteria were used to select for significant changes in gene expression. First, probe sets with less than 1.2 fold change comparing the KO to WT (control) were removed in order to reduce the number of genes undergoing statistical analysis. Second, genes were then tested statistically for significant changes in all three wild-type or NFI-A-deficient samples, using Student's t-test. Finally, genes were grouped based on their biological function using Affymetrix NetAffx, and NCBI Locuslink.

Here we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the periphilin-1 gene to explore its physiological role from an organismic perspective. In accordance with a ubiquitous expression of periphilin in the murine embryo, the homozygous deficiency of periphilin is lethal in early embryogenesis. We therefore characterized mice with a disruption of only one periphilin allele. As heterozygous periphilin knockout mice show no obvious histological alterations and have no apparent behavioural phenotypes, we compared whole transcriptome RNA expression profiles of total brain tissue of periphilin+/- knockout mice and wild type littermates for an in-depth analysis of heterozygous animals. In periphilin+/- knockout mice, 3 probe sets were indicative of significant differential expression (p less than 0.05, SLR greater than 1 which is equivalent to 2 fold). Two of these probe sets (1438864_at and 1439170_at) refer to unannotated or unclassifiable genes. According to the NetAffx Analysis Center, the third probe set (1447831_s_at) is assigned to myotubularin related protein 7 (Mtmr7). The probe set, however, lies upstream of the Mtmr7 gene (Ensembl gene ENSMUSG00000039431), and its signal is therefore not representative for the Mtmr7 gene. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis with a primer set specific for Mtmr7 confirmed that its expression is not altered in periphilin+/- knockout mice (relative expression compared to wild type: 0.924; p = 0.419). In summary, none of more than 45.000 covered transcripts is differentially expressed in periphilin+/- knockout mice in comparison to wild type littermates.

Since the signaling molecules RAS and ERK1/2 are activated by a LH surge in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles, we disrupted Erk1/2 in mouse granulosa cells and provide in vivo evidence that these kinases are necessary for LH-induced oocyte resumption of meiosis, ovulation, and luteinization. In addition, biochemical analyses and selected disruption of the Cebpb gene in granulosa cells demonstrate that C/EBP  is a critical downstream mediator of ERK1/2 activation. These mouse models provide in vivo systems in which to define the context specific and molecular mechanisms by which granulosa cells respond to LH and these mechanisms are relevant to the regulation of human fertility and infertility.

We previously developed a method to infer causal relationships among genes through the integration of DNA variation, gene transcription, and phenotypic information.  Here we validated our method through the characterization of transgenic and knockout mouse models of candidate genes that were predicted to be causal for abdominal obesity.  Perturbation of eight out of the nine genes, with Gas7, Me1 and Gpx3 being novel, resulted in significant changes in obesity related traits.  Liver expression signatures revealed alterations in common metabolic pathways and networks contributing to abdominal obesity and overlapped with a macrophage-enriched metabolic network module that is highly associated with metabolic traits in mice and humans.  Integration of gene expression in the design and analysis of traditional F2 intercross studies allows high confidence prediction of causal genes, and identification of involved pathways and networks.

To better understand the immune mechanisms contributing to clearance of infection, microarray methods were used to examine differential gene expression in the lungs of  C57BL/6 and CD40 ligand knock-out (CD40L-KO) mice over time following exposure to Pneumocystis. Immuncompetent C57BL/6 mice, which control and clear infection efficiently, showed a robust response to infection characterized by the upregulation of 349 primarily immune-response associated genes.  Temporal changes in the expression of these genes suggested that there was an early (week 2) primarily innate response, that waned without controlling infection; this were followed by primarily adaptive immune responses that peaked at week 5 and successfully cleared the infection. In conjunction with the latter, there was an increased expression of B cell associated (immunoglobulin) genes at week 6 that persisted through 11 weeks.   In contrast, CD40L-KO mice, which are highly susceptible to developing severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, showed essentially no upregulation of immune-response associated genes at days 35 to 75. Immunohistochemical staining supported these observations by demonstrating an increase in CD4+, CD68+, and CD19+ cells in C57BL/6 but not CD40L-KO mice. Thus, the healthy host demonstrates a robust biphasic response to infection by Pneumocystis; CD40 ligand is an essential upstream regulator of the adaptive immune responses that efficiently control infection and prevent development of progressive pneumonia. Keywords: Time course response Pneumocystis murina infection wild type versus CD40L-KO mice In experiment 1, C57BL/6 and CD40L-KO mice were co-housed in 2 cages; one cage was exposed to a P. murina-infected seeder, while the second was unexposed. Mice (3 per group) were sacrificed at day 32. Because the initial study demonstrated very little change in gene expression in CD40L-KO mice, only C57BL/6 mice were used for experiments 2 and 3. In Experiment 2,  three cages (10 animals/cage) were set up: 2 cages were exposed to P. murina, and one was unexposed. Animals (5 per cage) were sacrificed at days 34 and 41.

Aqp11-/- mice neonatally suffer from polycystic kidneys derived from the proximal tubule.  Its onset is proceeded by the vacuolization of ER.  However, the mechanism for the formation of vacuoles and the development of cysts remain to be clarified.  Here, we show that Aqp11-/- mice and polycystic kidney disease animals share a common pathogenic mechanism of cyst formation. Experiment Overall Design: Aqp11+/- mice, originally generated in a 129/SvEvBrd background (4), were back-crossed 10-11 times to a C57/BL6 background.  Heterozygous mice were interbred to obtain knockout (Aqp11-/-) and wild-type littermates (Aqp11+/+).  The genotypes of offsprings were analyzed by PCR using tail DNA as a template.  All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Tokyo.  One-week-old mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation.  Kidneys were rapidly excised on ice, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, immersed in RNAlater (Ambion) and stored at -20 C.  Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and cleaned up using an RNeasy minikit with DNase treatment (Qiagen).

Beginning around E10 of mouse development the prominences undergo rapid growth and morphogenesis. By E11.5 the medial nasal prominences are in close apposition in the midline, as are the maxillary and medial nasal prominences on either side of the developing face. Subsequently, by E12.5 the nasal and maxillary prominences fuse to form a continuous shelf at the front of the face - the primary palate. Individual prominences are associated with specific developmental processes, and this is reflected by patterns of differential gene expression that give the prominences their unique identities. Thus, only the mandibular and maxillary prominences give rise to dentition while the frontonasal prominence has a unique role in olfaction, and the mandibular prominence in taste. We used microarrays to detail the differential gene expression program in each of the mandibular, maxillary, and frontonasal prominences during the key developmental timepoints of E10.0 through E12.5. Experiment Overall Design: Analysis of gene expression during growth and fusion of the facial prominences in the C57BL/6J mouse strain between embryonic (E) day 10.0 and 12.5. At the earliest timepoint, E10, only the mandibular prominence is a distinct entity that can be readily identified and dissected. The frontonasal prominence and the maxillary prominence are very small and not discrete from other components of the head such as the forebrain until E10.5. Analysis of these tissues at earlier timepoints would require laser capture and preamplification steps - techniques that were not used for the later timepoints. Thus samples were isolated from the mandibular prominence at E10.0 and from the mandibular, maxillary and frontonasal prominences of mouse embryos from E10.5 to E12.5, at 0.5 day intervals. In order to obtain sufficient sample for hybridization, each sample represents a pool of between 3 and 48 embryos depending on the timepoint. Specifically, the number of embryos were 40-48 for E10.0 (mandibular prominence only), 24-8 for E10.5, 8-9 for E11.0 and E11.5 and 3-4 for E12.0 and E12.5. Seven replicate samples were taken for each of the later five timepoints in each of the three prominences, with an additional seven samples for the mandibular E10.0 timepoint, for a total of 112 samples. .. embryonic day 10.0;  embryonic day 10.5;  embryonic day 11.0;  embryonic day 11.5;  embryonic day 12.0;  embryonic day 12.5;  C57BL/6J;  Frontonasal prominence;  Mandibular prominence;  Maxillary prominence;  total RNA;  Frontonasal prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E10.5 days;  Frontonasal prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E11.0 days;  Frontonasal prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E11.5 days;  Frontonasal prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E12.0 days;  Frontonasal prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E12.5 days;  Mandibular prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E10.0 days;  Mandibular prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E10.5 days;  Mandibular prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E11.0 days;  Mandibular prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E11.5 days;  Mandibular prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E12.0 days;  Mandibular prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E12.5 days;  Maxillary prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E10.5 days;  Maxillary prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E11.0 days;  Maxillary prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E11.5 days;  Maxillary prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E12.0 days;  Maxillary prominence tissue from mouse embryos at E12.5 days;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Embryos were dissected from the uterus in ice-cold DEPC-PBS medium and then individually placed into drops of DEPC-PBS media in a petri dish. Embryos were then staged by plug time and craniofacial features. After staging, each embryo was bisected with forceps at the level of the heart and the caudal portion was discarded. Tungsten needles were employed to isolate the combined maxillary and mandibular prominences and these were then separated into their individual components. Next, the medial and lateral frontonasal prominences were removed from the remainder of the head. Briefly, an incision was made in the ectoderm overlying the prominences to produce a flap of ectoderm that was peeled back with the loosely aggregated cells of the mesenchyme still attached. Note that if the cut was made too deep and extends into the forebrain region, loosely packed mesenchymal cells were no longer visible. These latter samples that were potentially contaminated with forebrain tissue were discarded. Suitably pure maxillary, mandibular, and frontonasal samples were placed in separate tubes containing RNAlater (Ambion) and stored at -20C for later pooling and processing. Pooling was necessary to obtain sufficient RNA for screening of the microarrays.;

In skeletal muscle, laminin a2 chain binds at least two receptor complexes; the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and integrin a7b1. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder, we performed gene expression profiling of laminin a2 chain deficient mouse limb muscle. One of the down-regulated genes encodes a protein called calcium and integrin binding protein 2 (Cib2) whose expression and function is unknown. However, the closely related Cib1 has been reported to bind integrin aIIb and may be involved in outside-in-signaling in platelets. Since Cib2 might be a novel integrin a7b1 binding protein in muscle, we have studied Cib2 expression in the developing and adult mouse. Cib2 mRNA is mainly expressed in the developing central nervous system and in developing and adult skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle Cib2 colocalizes with integrin a7B subunit at the sarcolemma and at the neuromuscular- and myotendinous junctions. Finally, we demonstrate that Cib2 is a calcium binding protein that interacts with integrin a7Bb1D. Thus, our data suggest a role for Cib2 as a cytoplasmic effector of integrin a7Bb1D signaling in skeletal muscle.

In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected mouse forelimbs using a variety of gain- and loss-of-function hedgehog pathway mutants, as well as limbs dissected into responsive (posterior 2/3ds) and non-responsive (anterior 1/3d) Hh tissues. These data are used to obtain 753 genes that are differentially expressed in response to Shh signaling. Keywords: Comparison of genetic samples 28 Total samples were analyzed. We generated the following pairwise comparisons using PowerExpress: Shh<WT; SmoM2>WT; Gli3<WT; Gli3>WT; Ant<Post; Ant>Post. Genes with an FDR<=10% and a fold-change >=2 were selected. We did not generate pairwise comparisons for a certain combinations with SmoGli3 and Gli3 mutants because data from these arrays contained significant variability.  To identify additional genes that were Shh-responsive, we performed the following multiple sample comparisons using an FDR<=10% and a posterior probability cutoff of <=25%: 1.)

We fed mice from middle age (14-months) to old age (30-months) either a control diet, a low dose of resveratrol (4.9 mg kg-1 day-1), or a calorie restricted (CR) diet and examined genome-wide transcriptional profiles. We report a striking transcriptional overlap of CR and resveratrol in heart, skeletal muscle and brain. Both dietary interventions inhibit gene expression profiles associated with cardiac and skeletal muscle aging. Gene expression profiling suggests that both CR and resveratrol may retard some aspects of aging through alterations in chromatin structure and transcription. Resveratrol, at doses that can be readily achieved in humans, fulfills the definition of a dietary compound that mimics some aspects of CR. Experiment Overall Design: Heart, neocortex tissue, and gastrocnemius muscle was collected from young and old mice at 5 and 30 months of age, respectively; mice were subjected to either a calorie restricted diet or a control diet supplemented with resveratrol ..

Previous studies have suggested effects on inflammation, proliferation, and vasoconstriction. The goal of this study was to determine which of these were supported by alterations in gene expression in serotonin transporter knockout mice. Methods: Eight week old normoxic mice with a 5-HTT knock-out (5HTT-/-) and their heterozygote(5HTT+/-) or wild-type(5HTT+/+) littermates had right ventricular systolic pressure(RVSP) assessed, lungs collected for RNA, pooled, and used in duplicate in Affymetrix array analysis. Representative genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. Results: RVSP was normal in all groups. Only 124 genes were reliably changed between 5HTT-/- and 5HTT+/+ mice. More than half of these were either involved in inflammatory response or muscle function and organization; in addition, some matrix, heme oxygenase, developmental, and energy metabolism genes showed altered expression. Quantitative RT-PCR for examples from each major group confirmed changes seen by array, with an intermediate level in 5HTT+/- mice. Conclusions: These results for the first time show the in vivo effects of 5HTT knockout in lungs, and show that many of the downstream mechanisms suggested by cell culture and ex vivo experiments are also operational in vivo.  This suggests that the effect of 5HTT on pulmonary vascular function arises from its impact on several systems, including vasoreactivity, proliferation, and immune function. Experiment Overall Design: Comparison of whole lung total RNA from pools of wild-type, heterozygote, and knockout 5HTT mice to determine the pulmonary effects of loss of 5HTT expression. ..

The strain has an average litter size of more than 13 pups, and females commonly nurse up to 18 pups with greater than 90% survival to weaning. Along with an increased body weight (BW), these traits are clearly indicative of enhanced lactation performance (Knight et al., 1986). Indeed lactation performance, assessed by a weigh-suckle-weigh method, was 3-fold greater in QSi5 mice than the CBA strain (Riley et al., 2006). In this study, we utilize the divergent phenotypes of QSi5 and CBA/CaH mice to identify genes associated with enhanced mammary gland capacity. Experiment Overall Design: Five replicates from each of the two strains CBA and QSi5 were used for gene expression profiling.

Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in and full-length transgenic models of HD took longer to appear, 15- and 22-month CHL2(Q150/Q150), 18-month Hdh(Q92/Q92) and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. Whereas it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared with those caused by the expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. In addition, very high correlations between the signatures of mice expressing normal levels of wild-type huntingtin and mice in which the wild-type protein is absent suggest a limited effect of the wild-type protein to change basal gene expression or to influence the qualitative disease-related effect of mutant huntingtin. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides important temporal and mechanistic insights into the process by which mutant huntingtin kills striatal neurons. In addition, the discovery that several available lines of HD mice faithfully recapitulate the gene expression signature of the human disorder provides a novel aspect of validation with respect to their use in preclinical therapeutic trials.

We find that the transcription factor Ctip2 (also known as Bcl11b) is central to MSN differentiation and striatal development. Within the striatum, it is expressed by all MSN, while it is excluded from essentially all striatal interneurons. In the absence of Ctip2, MSN do not fully differentiate, as demonstrated by dramatically reduced expression of a large number of MSN markers, including DARPP-32, FOXP1, Chrm4, Reelin, MOR1, GluR1, and Plexin-D1. Furthermore, MSN fail to aggregate into patches, resulting in severely disrupted patch-matrix organization within the striatum. Finally, heterotopic cellular aggregates invade the Ctip2-/- striatum suggesting a failure by MSN to repel these cells in the absence of Ctip2.   In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie Ctip2-dependent differentiation of MSN and that underlie the patch-matrix disorganization in the mutant striatum, we directly compared gene expression between wild type and mutant striatum at P0. Because CTIP2-expressing MSN constitute 90-95% of the neurons within the striatum, we reasoned that we should be able to detect changes in medium spiny neuron gene expression in Ctip2 null mutants. We microdissected out small regions of striatum at matched locations in wild type and Ctip2-/- mutant littermates at P0 and investigated gene expression with Affymetrix microarrays. We selected the 153 most significant genes and further analyzed them to identify a smaller set of genes of potentially high biological relevance. In order to verify the microarray data and define the distribution of the identified genes in the striatum, we performed in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry for 12 selected genes: Plexin-D1, Ngef, Nectin-3, Kcnip2, Pcp4L1, Neto1, Basonuclin 2, Fidgetin, Semaphorin 3e, Secretagogin, Unc5d, and Neurotensin. We find that all these genes are either specifically downregulated (Plexin-D1, Ngef, Nectin-3 Kcnip2, Pcp4L1, Neto1), or upregulated (Basonuclin 2, Fidgetin, Semaphorin 3e, Secretagogin, Unc5d, Neurotensin), in the Ctip2-/- striatum, confirming and extending the microarray results. Together, these data indicate that Ctip2 is a critical regulator of MSN differentiation, striatal patch development, and the establishment of the cellular architecture of the striatum. Experiment Overall Design: Matched regions of striatum from wild type and Ctip2-/- mice were obtained via 500  m diameter punch biopsies performed in the center of the developing striatum in acutely sectioned 300  m coronal slices of the brain at postnatal day 0 (P0). Sections were matched rostro-caudally between wild type and null mutant tissue, and fiduciary landmarks were used to assure reproducible microdissection of comparable regions. RNA was extracted using the StrataPrep Total RNA Mini Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and RNA quality was assayed using a bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Paola Alto, CA). To ensure reproducibility and biological significance, microarrays were performed with RNA samples from three independent wild type, one heterozygote, and four Ctip2-/- mice (biological replicates). Microarray data were normalized using the RMA function within Bioconductor (Irizarry et al., 2003).  Statistical significance of gene expression differences between wild type and knockout was determined using Statistical Analysis of Micrarrays (SAM) (Tusher et al., 2001). Using a SAM d-score cutoff of > 2 or < -2, we selected the 153 most significant genes and further analyzed them to identify a smaller set of genes of potentially high biological relevance. .. postnatal day 0;  Ctip2 heterozygote;  Ctip2 null mutant;  Wild type;  BALB/c;  total RNA;  Ctip2 heterozygous mouse striatum, postnatal day 0;  Ctip2 knockout mouse striatum, postnatal day 0;  Wild type mouse striatum, postnatal day 0;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Although chylomicrons are known to assemble in part within membrane secretory pathways, the modifications required for efficient vascular uptake are unknown. We report that the transcription factor Pleomorphic adenoma gene-like 2 (PLAGL2) is essential for this aspect of dietary lipid metabolism. PlagL2-/- mice die from post-natal wasting owing to failure of fat absorption. Lipids modified in the absence of PlagL2 exit from enterocytes but fail to enter interstitial lacteal vessels. Dysregulation of enterocyte genes closely linked to intracellular membrane transport identified candidate regulators of critical steps in chylomicron assembly. PlagL2 thus regulates essential and poorly understood aspects of dietary lipid absorption and its deficiency represents an authentic animal model with implications for amelioration of obesity or the metabolic syndrome.

To systematically discover such ovarian fertility factors en masse, we employed a mouse model (Foxo3), where follicles are assembled normally but are then synchronously activated. Gene expression profiling of mutant and normal ovaries led to the identification a surprisingly large set of ovarian factors. The set included the vast majority of known ovarian factors, many of which when mutated produce female sterility phenotypes, but most were novel. Subsequent analyses revealed novel classes of ovarian factors and significant overrpresentation on the X chromosome, among other insights into the general properties of oogenesis genes and their patterns of expression. Experiment Overall Design: Total ovarian RNA from +/+ and -/- ovaries at PND1, 3, 7, and 14 (n=3 replicates per timepoint and genotype, a total of 24 microarrays) was subjected to linear RNA amplification and hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 mouse whole-genome microarrays, which interrogate >39K transcripts including the vast majority of protein-coding genes.

Numerous studies have revealed the significance of cytokines TNF and IL-1 in the onset and progression of RA. Due to the complexity of interactions among different cytokines and immune cells, little is known about the precise molecular mechanisms underlying RA. In this study, oligonucleotide microarray analysis and a mouse model of RA, IL-1 receptor antagonist deficient mice were used to address this issue. Two hundred and ninety transcripts were found to be dysregulated greater than or equal to 2-fold in the diseased mice. Phase-specific gene expression changes were identified, including early increase and late decrease of heat shock protein coding genes and Cyr61. Moreover, common gene expression changes were also observed, especially the upregulation of paired-Ig-like receptor A (Pira) in both early and late phases of arthritis. We conclude that common and distinct gene expression change patterns that were identified globally may represent novel opportunities for better control of RA through early diagnosis and development of alternative therapeutic strategies.

RORalpha1 and RORgamma1, but not RORalpha4, show an oscillatory pattern of expression during circadian rhythm. To obtain insight into the physiological functions of ROR receptors in liver, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of livers from WT, RORalpha-deficient staggerer mice (RORalphasg/sg), RORgamma-/-, and RORalpha sg/sgRORgamma-/- double knockout (DKO) mice by microarray analysis. DKO mice were generated to study functional redundancy between RORalpha and RORgamma. These analyses demonstrated that RORalpha and RORgamma affect the expression of a number of genes. RORalpha and RORalpha are particularly important in the regulation of genes encoding several Phase I and Phase II metabolic enzymes, including several 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (Hsd3b), the cytochrome P450 (Cyp) enzymes Cyp7b1, Cyp4a14, and Cyp8b1, and the sulfotransferases Sult1e1 and Sult2a1. Our data show that RORalpha and RORgamma can influence gene expression positively as well as negatively. In addition, our results indicate that RORalpha and RORgamma each affect the expression of a specific set of genes but also exhibit functional redundancy. Our study shows that RORalpha and RORgamma receptors influence the regulation of several metabolic pathways, including those involved in the metabolism of steroids, bile acids, and xenobiotics, suggesting that RORs are important in the control of metabolic homeostasis.

Previous work suggested that increased expression of the dystrophin-related protein utrophin in the mdx mouse model of DMD can prevent dystrophic pathophysiology.   Physiological tests showed that the transgenic mouse muscle functioned in a way similar to normal muscle.  More recently, it has become possible to analyse disease pathways using microarrays, a sensitive method to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic approach.  We thus examined the gene expression profile of mdx mouse muscle compared to normal mouse muscle and compared the data with that obtained from the transgenic line expressing utrophin.  The data confirm that the expression of utrophin in the mdx mouse muscle results in a gene expression profile virtually identical to that seen for the normal mouse.  This study confirms that a strategy to up-regulate utrophin is likely to be effective in preventing the disease.

TAF7L is an X-linked germ cell-specific paralogue of TAF7, which is a generally expressed component of TFIID. Here we report the generation of Taf7l mutant mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells using the Cre-loxP strategy. While spermatogenesis is completed in Taf7l mutant mice, the weight of Taf7l mutant testis is decreased and the amount of sperm in the epididymis is sharply reduced. Mutant epididymal sperm exhibit abnormal morphology including folded tails. Sperm motility is significantly reduced, and Taf7l mutant males are fertile with reduced litter size. Microarray profiling reveals that the abundance of six gene transcripts (including Fscn1) in Taf7l mutant testis decreases by > 2-fold. In particular, FSCN1 is an F-action-bundling protein and thus may be critical for normal sperm morphology and sperm motility. Although deficiency of Taf7l may be compensated in part by Taf7, Taf7l has apparently evolved new specialized functions in the gene-selective transcription in male germ-cell differentiation. Our mouse studies suggest that mutations in human TAF7L gene might be implicated in X-linked oligozoospermia in men. Experiment Overall Design: Mice on C57BL/6J strain background were selected.

In the brain, Egr transcription factors have a critical role in learning and memory processing, presumably by regulating effector target genes that alter synaptic efficacy or mediate structural changes in neurons.  Previous work suggests that Egr1 and Egr3 are the most important synaptic activity induced Egr molecules in the brain and they appear to have redundant regulatory function.  How Egr transcriptional regulators influence learning and memory processing in the brain is unknown because target genes regulated by them have not been identified.  Using Affymetrix microarray analysis and Egr loss-of-function mice, we will begin to characterize the gene regulatory networks modulated by Egr transcription factors in the brain.  We anticipate that basic mechanisms related to transcriptional control of learning and memory related plasticity and the identification of plasticity effector molecules that may be involved in synaptic dysfunction associated with degenerative diseases or brain injury will result from these studies. To identify Egr transcription factor target gene regulation in brain:  Target genes regulated by Egr transcription factors have not been identified in the brain, yet the transcription factors are essential for normal learning and memory processes.  Using Egr1/3 double knockout and wild type littermate mice, we will compare gene expression profiles from somatosensory cortex to identify genes that are deregulated in Egr1/3 dKO brains. Egr1 and Egr3 gene expression is coupled to synaptic N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling engaged by NMDA receptor activation and long term synaptic potentiation (LTP).  Previous studies have demonstrated defects in late phase LTP, long-term memory in hippocampal dependent tasks and reconsolidation of memories in Egr1-deficient mice, but the target effector molecules regulated by Egr transcription factors are not known.  We hypothesize that it will be possible to identify Egr dependent target genes by using Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare gene expression from wild type cerebral cortex that has high levels of Egr protein expression with gene expression in cortex from Egr1/3 double knockout mice. Egr1 and Egr3 are highly expressed in mouse cortex and hippocampus twenty one days after birth because of the large amount of maternal stimulation they receive prior to weaning.  We will compare the gene expression profile in somatosensory cortex from P21 wild type mice to that of P21 Egr1/3 dKO mice.  We will perform microarray analysis using the Mouse 430 2.0 gene array with RNA samples from 3 wild type and 3 1/3 dKO brains (6 arrays total).  Differentially regulated genes (up-regulated and down-regulated) will be identified from the list of genes with significantly altered expression greater than or equal to 2-fold by paired T test.  Interesting genes will be validated by real-time PCR in wild type and 1/3 dKO brains.  Our main goal is to identify genes that are directly regulated by Egr3.  Recognizing that both direct and indirect target genes may be identified in the list of differentially expressed genes, real-time PCR validated target genes will be further screened using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with PCR (ChIP-PCR) to determine whether Egr1 and/or Egr3 are bound to potential regulatory regions of the putative target genes. .. none;  total RNA;  brain, cerebral cortex;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Institute for Experimental Medical Research and Department of Pathology, Ulleval University Hospital, Oslo, Norway and Institute for Medical Genetics, National Hospital, Oslo, Norway; E-mail: k.e.nakken@medisin.uio.no. Background and Aims: Abcb4 (mdr2) (-/-) mice secrete phosphatidylcholine-free bile and develop chronic cholangitis. This study aims at identifying differentially transcribed genes that govern liver pathology during this disease. Methods: Hepatic gene transcription was measured in  3, 6, 9 and 20 week old abcb4 (-/-) mice (FVB.129P2-abcb4tm1Bor/J) using cDNA microarrays; FVB/NJ abcb4 (+/+) mice serving as controls. Altered gene transcriptions were verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Attention focused on genes coding for chemokines and cytokines of potential pathogenic importance and on matrix housekeeping genes, growth factors and genes regulating wound healing, epithelial morphogenesis and tissue development. Disease phenotype was characterized by histopathology scoring. Results: Transcription of  serpina3 genes showed early downregulation. Genes exhibiting upregulated transcription included: Cxcl10, Ccl2, Ccl20, Ctgf, Elf3, Lgals3, Mmp12, Mmp15, Spp1, Loxl2, Pdgfa, Pdgfrb, Sparc, Tgfbi, Tgfbr2. Conclusions: During early phases of chronic cholangitis in abcb4 (-/-) mice, hepatic downregulation of  serpina3 genes  and enhanced transcription of genes sustaining inflammatory processes contribute to fashioning the portal tract pathology. Later, enhanced transcription of genes governing tissue repair consolidate the portal tract pathology.

Disruptions in electrical activity, resulting from prolonged bed-rest, cast-immobilization or trauma, inevitably lead to muscle atrophy.  The mechanisms that regulate muscle atrophy are poorly understood, but it seems likely that changes in gene expression play a key role in initiating and maintaining a muscle atrophy program.  Previously, we found that Runx1, a transcription factor previously termed AML1, was substantially induced in muscle following denervation.  More recently, we sought to determine whether this increase in Runx1 expression may be causally related to the morphological changes in skeletal muscle that accompany muscle disuse, notably muscle atrophy.  We found that Runx1 is indeed required to sustain muscle and to minimize atrophy following denervation.  Experiments described here are designed to identify the genes that are regulated by Runx1 in skeletal muscle with the particular goal of identifying genes that regulate muscle atrophy. We propose to use microarray analysis to identify genes, expressed in skeletal muscle, that are mis-regulated in mice lacking Runx1. We inactivated runx1 selectively in skeletal muscle and found that denervated myofibers in mutant mice atrophy far more (90% atrophy) than in wild-type mice (30% atrophy).   We therefore reason that Runx1 activates and/or represses genes that are required to sustain muscle and to minimize atrophy. We generated MCK::cre; runx1f/- and runx1f/- control mice.  In normal mice, an increase in runx1 expression is detected by two days after denervation and is maximal by five days after denervation.  Muscle atrophy is first evident between one and two weeks after denervation.  As we wish to avoid detecting global changes in gene expression that are associated with late stages of muscle atrophy, we plan to denervate muscle for three or five days and to compare gene expression in dissected innervated and denervated muscles from mutant and control mice.  We will generate thirty samples for comparison-5 replicates per condition:  Samples 1-3 from runx1f/- control mice. (1) innervated tibialis anterior muscles (TA); (2) 3-day-denervated TA; (3) 5-day-denervated TA. Samples 4-6 from MCK::cre; runx1f/- mice. (4) innervated TA; (5) 3-day-denervated TA; (6) 5-day-denervated TA.  We obtain sufficient total RNA (10 micrograms) from each dissected muscle to avoid pooling samples.  We will analyze adult mice of the same age (~six weeks after birth; most will be littermates) and sex-male. It is difficult to anticipate how many genes will be identified in this screen, as few target genes for Runx1 have been identified in any cell type and none in skeletal muscle.  Moreover, although we would prefer to focus our attention on genes that are strongly dependent upon Runx1 expression (e.g. more than 5-fold difference in expression in wild-type and mutant mice), we do not know the extent to which target gene expression will depend upon Runx1.  For these reasons, in these experiments, we will analyze expression from five "identical" samples, so that we can be confident that even small (e.g. three-fold) differences in expression can be reliably determined.  Importantly, in order to confirm results obtained from the microarray data, we will use other assays (RNase protection) to measure RNA expression of candidate genes in innervated and denervated muscles of wild-type and mutant mice. .. none;  total RNA;  skeletal muscle, tibialis anterior;  10090;  Mus musculus;

The immediate application of the newly developed V1V3 method to single cells in this stage of mouse embryos revealed the presence of two populations of cells, one with primitive endoderm expression and the other with pluripotent epiblast-like gene expression.  The genes expressed differentially between these two populations were well preserved in morphologically differentiated primitive endoderm and epiblast in the embryos one day later (E4.5), demonstrating that the method successfully detects subtle but essential differences in gene expression at the single-cell level among seemingly homogeneous cell populations.  This study provides a strategy to analyze biophysical events in medicine as well as in neural, stem cell, and developmental biology, where small numbers of distinctive or diseased cells play critical roles. Experiment Overall Design: We isolated blastocysts at E3.5 and dissociated the ICM into single cells by trypsin-EDTA treatment.  To prepare cDNA samples, we then randomly picked a total of 55 single cells.  cDNAs were synthesized and amplified by the V1V3 method, and screened by gene-specific PCR using Oct4 and Cdx2 to remove trophectoderm cells, and 50 cells were identified as Oct4-positive and Cdx2-negative, ICM cells. ..

We generated Tslc1/Igsf4-deficient mice by disrupting exon 1 of the gene and found that Tslc1-/- mice were born with the expected Mendelian ratio but Tslc1-/- male mice were infertile.  In adult Tslc1-/- mice of 11-week of age, the weight of the testis was 90% of that of the Tslc1+/+ mice, and the number of sperm in the semen was approximately 0.01% of it.  Histological analysis revealed that the round spermatids and the pachytene spermatocytes failed to attach to the Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules and sloughed off into the lumen with apoptosis in the Tslc1-/- mice.  On the other hand, the spermatogonia and the Sertoli cells, as well as the interstitial cells, were essentially unaffected.  In the Tslc1+/+ mice, TSLC1/IGSF4 expression was observed in the spermatogenic cells from the intermediate spermatogonia to the early pachyten spermatocytes and from step-7 or later spermatids.  These findings suggest that TSLC1/IGSF4 expression is indispensable for the adhesion of spermatocytes and spermatids to Sertoli cells and for their normal differentiation to mature spermatozoa. Experiment Overall Design: The protocol used for the sample preparation and microarray processing is available from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA).  Briefly, 3 ug purified RNA, extracted from the testis from Tslc1+/+ and Tslc1-/- mice of 16-week-old, was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using the primer T7-dT24 containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter.  After a second strand of cDNA was synthesized using RNase H, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, and E. coli DNA ligase, in vitro transcription was carried out on the cDNA to produce biotin-labeled cRNA with a MEGAscript High Yield Transcription Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer.  After the cRNA was linearly amplified with T7 polymerase, the biotinylated cRNA was cleaned with an RNeasy Mini Column (Qiagen), fragmented to 50 to 200 nucleotides, and then hybridized to Mouse Genome U74A ver.2 arrays (Affymetrix).  The stained microarray was scanned with a GeneArray Scanner (Affymetrix), and the signal was calculated with Affymetrix software, Microarray Suite 5.0.

It has also been implicated in regulating expression of genes that act in the epithelium of the lower gastrointestinal tract.  This implied that HNF4alpha might be required for development of the gut.  Methods:  We generated mouse embryos in which Hnf4alpha was ablated in the epithelial cells of the fetal colon using Cre-loxP technology.  Embryos were examined using a combination of histology, immunohistochemistry, gene array and RT-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses to define the consequence of loss of HNF4alpha on colon development.  Results: Embryos could be generated until E18.5 that lacked HNF4alpha in their colon.  Although, early stages of colonic development occurred, HNF4alpha null colons failed to form normal crypts.  In addition, goblet cell maturation was perturbed and expression of an array of genes that encode proteins with diverse roles in colon function was disrupted.  Several genes whose expression in the colon was dependent on HNF4alpha contained HNF4alphabinding sites sequences within putative transcriptional regulatory regions and a subset of these sites were occupied by HNF4alpha in vivo.  Conclusion:  HNF4alpha is a transcription factor that is essential for development of the mammalian colon, regulates goblet cell maturation and is required for expression of genes that control normal colon function and epithelial cell differentiation.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is one of the most frequent causes of mental retardation in women. A great landmark in research in this field was the discovery of a relationship between the disease and the presence of mutations in the gene that codes for the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Currently, MeCP2 is thought to act as a transcriptional repressor that couples DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing. The present study aimed to identify new target genes directly regulated by Mecp2 in a mouse model of RTT. Methodology. We have compared the gene expression profiles of wild type (WT) and Mecp2-null (KO) mice in three regions of the brain (cortex, midbrain, and cerebellum) by using cDNA microarrays. The results obtained were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed seven direct target genes of Mecp2 bound in vivo (Dlk1, Mobp, Plagl1, Ddc, Mllt2h, Eya2, and S100a9), and two overexpressed genes due to an indirect effect of a lack of Mecp2 (Irak1 and Prodh). Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the methylation patterns of promoters of the described genes showed no differences between WT and KO mice, demonstrating that methylation differences were not the cause of the observed expression changes. Moreover, the regions bound by Mecp2 were always methylated, suggesting the involvement of the methyl-CpG binding domain of the protein in the mechanism of interaction. Conclusions. We identified new genes that are overexpressed in KO mice and are excellent candidate genes for involvement in various features of the neurodevelopmental disease. Our results demonstrate new targets of MeCP2 and provide us with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of RTT. Comparative experiment: Mecp2-null (KO) mice vs. their corresponding age-mated wild type (WT) littermates (CONTROLS).

To allow the engagement of appropriate experimental paradigms, Huntington's disease (HD) models need to be validated in terms of how they recapitulate a particular aspect of human disease. In order to examine transcriptome-related effects of mutant huntingtin, we compared striatal mRNA profiles from seven genetic mouse models of disease to that of postmortem human HD caudate using microarray analysis. Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in models of HD took longer to appear, 15-month and 22-month CHL2Q150/Q150, 18-month HdhQ92/Q92 and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. When the affected genes were compared across models, a robust concordance was observed. Importantly, changes concordant across multiple lines mice were also in excellent agreement with the mRNA changes seen in human HD caudate. Although it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared to those caused by expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. There was, however, an overall concordance between transcriptomic signature and disease stage. We thus conclude that the transcriptional changes of HD can be modelled in several available lines of transgenic mice, comprising lines expressing both N-terminal and full-length mutant huntingtin proteins. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides an important chronology of mutant huntingtin's gene expression effects.

Around 10% of DS newborns have a transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) that resolves spontaneously. Somatic mutations acquired during fetal hematopoiesis in the GATA1 transcription factor are detected in megakaryoblasts from all the DS TMDs or AMKLs. GATA1 is an X chromosome transcription factor essential for the development of multiple hematopoietic lineages. Loss of GATA1 results in embryonic lethality due to severe anemia. The GATA1 mutations result in the expression of a shorter isoform, GATA1s. Replacement of GATA1 with GATA1s causes transient proliferation of immature fetal megakaryocytic progenitors. The Hsa21 ETS transcription factor, ERG, is expressed in megakaryocytes and erythrocytes and is involved in several types of cancer. Mutation in GATA1 gene leading to expression of the short isoform (GATA1s) that occurs on the background of trisomy 21 is regarded as one of the driving forces for megakaryocytic expansion observed in DS fetal livers. ERG, which is located on chromosome 21, is considered one of the leading candidates to cooperate with GATA1 mutation in the generation of DS AMKL. To study the in vivo cooperation between ERG and GATA1 isoforms, we crossed the ERG transgenic mice with the GATA1s Knock-in mice (GATA null background). We found that males expressing both ERG and the short isoform of GATA1(GATA1s) died in uterus between embryonic days E121/2 and E141/2.We studied erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis in fetal livers from the different genotypes generated from our cross. We used expression array to study the specific interaction of ERG with the different GATA1 isoforms in fetal livers from E121/2 and E141/2 and identify ERG, GATA1 and GATA1s target genes by comparing sets of genes that are activated or repressed in the presence of ERG and the two isoforms of GATA1. ..

Similar to humans, mice heterozygous for the hypomorphic Pex1-G844D allele do not display age-related retinal abnormalities. We conducted a comparative analysis of retinal gene expression profile from Pex1-G844D homozygous and heterozygous mice in order to investigate the pathomechanisms of vision loss in humans with mild forms of ZSD.

Forebrain development requires coordinated vascular investment alongside NSC differentiation. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegf) has proven to be a pleiotrophic gene whose multiple protein isoforms regulate a broad range of effects in neurovascular systems. To test the hypothesis that the Vegf isoforms (120, 164, and 188) are required for normal forebrain development, we analyzed the forebrain transcriptome of mice expressing specific Vegf isoforms, Vegf120, VegfF188, or a combination of Vegf120/188. Transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed genes in embryonic day (E) 9.5 forebrain, a time point preceding dramatic neuroepithelial expansion and vascular investment in the telencephalon. Meta-analysis identified gene pathways linked to chromosome-level modifications, cell fate regulation, and neurogenesis that were altered in Vegf isoform mice.

Previous studies reported that Taf7l knockout mice exhibit structurally abnormal sperm, reduced sperm count, weakened motility and compromised fertility. Here we find that continued backcrossing of Taf7l-/Y mice from N5 to N9 produced KO males that are essentially sterile. Genome-wide expression profiling by mRNA-seq analysis of wild type (WT) and Taf7l-/Y (KO) testes revealed that Taf7l ablation impairs the expression of many post-meiotic spermatogenic specific as well as metabolic genes. Importantly, histological analysis of testes revealed that Taf7l-/Y mice develop post-meiotic arrest at the first stage of spermiogenesis, phenotypically similar to Trf2-/- mice, but distinct from Taf4b-/- mice. Indeed, we find that Taf7l and Trf2 co-regulate post-meiotic genes, but none of Taf4b-regulated germ stem cell genes in testes. Genome-wide ChIP-seq studies indicate that TAF7L binds to promoters of activated post-meiotic genes in testis. Moreover, biochemical studies show that TAF7L associates with TRF2 both in vitro and in testis suggesting that TAF7L likely cooperates directly with TRF2 at promoters of a subset of post-meiotic genes to regulate spermiogenesis. Our findings thus provide a new mechanism for cell-type specific transcriptional control involving an interaction between a 'non-prototypic' core promoter recognition factor (Trf2) and an orphan TAF subunit (Taf7l) in mammalian testis-specific gene transcription.

The senescence-accelerated mouse (SAMP8) strain exhibits decreased learning and memory and increased amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation at 12 months compared to 4 months.  To detect differences in gene expression in SAMP8 mice, we used a Control mouse that was a 50% cross between SAMP8 and CD-1 mice and which showed no memory deficits  (50% SAMP8 mouse).  We then compared gene expression in the hippocampus of 4 month and 12 month old SAMP8 and Control mice using Affymetrix gene arrays.  At 12 months, but not at 4 months, pathway analysis revealed significant differences in the Long Term Potentiation (LTP) (6 genes), Phosphatidylinositol Signaling (6 genes), and Endocytosis (10 genes) pathways.  The changes in LTP included MAPK signaling (N-ras, CREB binding protein, protein phosphatase inhibitor 1) and Ca-dependent signaling (PI receptors 1 and 2 and phospholipase C).  Changes in phosphatidylinositol signaling genes suggested altered signaling through PI3-kinase, and Western blotting revealed phosphorylation changes in AKT and 70S6K.  Changes in the Endocytosis pathway involved genes related to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (dynamin and clathrin).  Endocytosis is required for receptor recycling, is involved in A   metabolism, and is regulated by phosphatidylinositol signaling.  In summary, these studies demonstrate altered genes expression in three SAMP8 hippocampal pathways associated with memory formation and consolidation.  These pathways may provide new therapeutic targets in addition to targeting A   metabolism itself.

First variable was age (4 and 12 months) and second variable was mouse strain (Control and SAMP8).  This results in 4 groups: Control-4 month, Control-12 month, SAMP8-4 month, and SAMP8-12 month.   Each group had 4 biological replicates (4 mice).  The "Control" mice were a 50% backcross of the SAMP8 mice with CD-1 mice (50% SAMP8 mice).  These mice were closely related to SAMP8 mice but exhibited no memory deficits at 4 or 12 months.  The SAMP8 mice had memory deficits at 12 months but not at 4 months. .. 12 months;  4 months;  total RNA;  Mouse Hippocampus from 12 month-old, 50% SAMP8 mice -- 50% backcross of SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated) mice with CD-1 mice;  Mouse Hippocampus from 12 month-old, SAMP8 mice -- SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated) mice;  Mouse Hippocampus from 4 month-old, 50% SAMP8 mice -- 50% backcross of SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated) mice with CD-1 mice;  Mouse Hippocampus from 4 month-old, SAMP8 mice -- SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated) mice;  50% SAMP8 mice -- 50% backcross of SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated) mice with CD-1 mice;  SAMP8 mice -- SAMP8 (senescence-accelerated) mice;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Hippocampus;  In order to assess memory and cognitive function in each mouse, T-maze foot shock avoidance and novel object recognition were measured as described in the manuscript.

Estrogen receptor (ER) b is highly expressed in ovarian granulosa cells and mice lacking ERb (bERKO) are subfertile due to inefficient ovulation.  Previous work has focused on isolated granulosa cells or cultured follicles and while informative, provides confounding results due to the heterogeneous cell types present including granulosa, theca and oocytes and exposure to in vitro conditions.  Herein, we isolated preovulatory granulosa cells from WT and ERb-null mice using laser capture microdissection to examine the genomic transcriptional response downstream of PMSG (mimicking FSH) and PMSG/hCG (mimicking LH) stimulation.  This allows for a direct comparison of in vivo granulosa cells at the same stage of development from both WT and ERb-null ovaries. ERb-null granulosa cells showed altered expression of genes known to be regulated by FSH (Akap12 and Runx2) as well as not previously reported (Arnt2 and Pou5f1) in WT granulosa cells. Our analysis also identified 304 genes not previously associated with ERb in granulosa cells.  LH responsive genes including Abcb1b and Fam110c show reduced expression in ERb-null granulosa cells; however novel genes including Rassf2 and Megf10 were also identified as being downstream of LH signaling in granulosa cells.  Collectively, our data suggests that granulosa cells from ERb-null ovaries may not be appropriately differentiated and are unable to respond properly to gonadotropin stimulation We used microarray to compare the gene expression profiles of wiltype (WT) and Erb-null (bERKO) preovulatory granulosa cells as they respond to either PMSG or PMSG+hCG treatments. Laser microdissection was used to collect a purified population of granulosa cells only from preovulatory follicles. We chose to compre the response to PMSG or PMSG+hCG of granulosa cells collected from either WT and bERKO preovulatory follicles. We chose to collect cells 48h after mice were treated with PMSG to compare the gene expression profile ot preovulatory granulosa cells. We also studied the response of these cells to LH (or hCG) as we collected cells 4h after mice were treated with hCG (peak of transcriptional response to hCG). .. preovulatory granulosa cells;  WT;  bERKO;  total RNA;  PMSG treated granulosa cells from WT mice;  PMSG treated granulosa cells from bERKO mice;  PMSG/hCG treated granulosa cells from WT mice;  PMSG/hCG treated granulosa cells from bERKO mice;  10090;  Mus musculus;  48h after PMSG;  48h after PMSG + 4 h after hCG;  Cells were collected on to LCM caps. 50 ul of Extraction buffer was added, tubes were spun and samples frozen at -80C until extraction.;

To characterize the role of GATA6 in adrenocortical development and function, we generated mice in which Gata6 was conditionally deleted using Cre-LoxP recombination with Sf1-cre. The adrenal glands of adult Gata6 conditional knockout (cKO) mice were small and had a thin cortex with thickened capsule. Cytomegalic changes were evident in the adrenal glands of fetal and adult cKO mice, and chromaffin cells were ectopically located at the periphery of the glands. The secretion of corticosterone in response to exogenous ACTH was blunted in cKO mice. Cells expressing gonadal-like markers, including Gata4, Amhr2, and Tcf21, accumulated in the adrenal capsule and subcapsule of cKO mice, suggesting aberrant adrenocortical progenitor/stem cell differentiation. Gonadectomy triggered the overexpression of sex steroidogenic differentiation markers, such as Lhcgr and Cyp17, in the adrenal glands of male and female cKO mice. Nulliparous female and orchiectomized male cKO mice lacked an adrenal X-zone. Microarray hybridization identified Pik3c2g as a novel X-zone marker that is downregulated in the adrenal glands of nulliparous female Gata6 cKO mice.

However, cohesin-associated interactions have not been characterized on a genome-wide scale. Here we performed chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) of the cohesin subunit SMC1A in developing mouse limb. We identified 2,264 SMC1A interactions, of which 1,491 (65%) involved sites co-occupied by CTCF. SMC1A participates in tissue- specific enhancer-promoter interactions and interactions that demarcate regions of correlated regulatory output. In contrast to previous studies, we also identified interactions between promoters and distal sites that are maintained in multiple tissues, but are poised in embryonic stem cells and resolve to tissue-specific activated or repressed chromatin states in the mouse embryo. Our results reveal the diversity of cohesin- associated interactions in the genome and highlight their role in establishing the regulatory architecture of development.

This response is influenced by specific integrin signalling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Microfibril-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) colocates in blood vessels with elastic fibers. MFAP4 contains an N-terminal RGD-motiv, which is a potential integrin binding site. The role for MFAP4 in vascularproliferative disease is so far unknown and the subject for these investigations. Here we show that MFAP4 is expressed and secreted by VSMCs and binds elastin and collagen. MFAP4 mediated adhesion, and migration, and proliferation of VSMCs in an integrinaVB3/5 dependent manner and the effects were inhibited by MFAP4 blocking antibodies. MFAP4 deficient mutant mice were generated and appeared with a normal cardiophysiological phenotype. When challenged by carotid artery ligation, the MFAP4 deficient mice had delayed neointimal formation and the compensatory outward remodeling of the vessel diameter and thus the vessel lumen was reduced. MFAP4 expression appeared unaffected by the induced pathology. HUMANE DATA This new MFAP4 mediated molecular mechanism for regulation of integrin aVB3/5 signalling may have therapeutic implications in diseases where VSMC migration and proliferation are involved in the pathogenesis. For genome-wide expression analysis total RNA from heart of four male MFAP4-/- and four control mice was isolated using RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).

We recently reported that MuRF1, but not MuRF2, regulated pathologic cardiac hypertrophy in vivo.  This was surprising since MuRF1 and MuRF2 interact redundantly with sarcomeric proteins in yeast two hybrid studies, and form both homo- and hetero-dimers with each other.  To determine if MuRF1 and MuRF2 were functionally redundant during development, we created mice lacking either 3 or 4 of the MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles and compared them functionally.  Surprisingly, only mice missing all four MuRF1 and MuRF2 alleles (MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/-) developed a spontaneous hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - mice that were null for one of the genes, but heterozygous for the other (i.e. MuRF1-/-//MuRF2+/- or MuRF1+/-//MuRF2-/-) were phenotypically identical to wild type mice.  Electron microscopy of the hearts of MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/-(MuRF1/MuRF2 DN) mice identified altered Z disc and M line architecture, and a distinct swelling of mitochondria. MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/- mouse hearts displayed increased expression of genes associated with fetal cardiac metabolism, including smooth muscle actin and b myosin heavy chain, suggesting that the cardiac hypertrophy seen in these mice was associated with a reversion to a fetal gene program. Despite our prediction that we would also see an increase in glucose compared to fatty acid oxidation (another trait of fetal cardiac metabolism) we saw that MuRF1-/-//MuRF2-/- heart homogenates oxidized significantly less glucose compared to controls, suggesting an important role for MuRF1 and MuRF2 in the regulation of glucose metabolism in vivo. This study identifies a previously unreported redundancy in the function of MuRF proteins in normal cardiac development.  Keywords: Genetic modification.

This small molecule directly triggers gene activation by binding to nuclear receptors (RARs), switching them from potential repressors to transcriptional activators. The repertoire of RA-regulated genes in embryonic tissues is poorly characterized. We performed a comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of murine wild-type and Retinaldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 null-mutant (Raldh2-/-) embryos - unable to synthesize RA from maternally-derived retinol-using Affymetrix DNA microarrays. Transcriptomic changes were analyzed in two embryonic regions: anterior tissues including forebrain and optic vesicle, and posterior (trunk) tissues, at early stages preceding the appearance of overt phenotypic abnormalities. Several genes expected to be downregulated under RA deficiency appeared in the transcriptome data (e.g. Emx2, Foxg1 anteriorly, Cdx1, Hoxa1, Rarb posteriorly), whereas reverse-transcriptase-PCR and in situ hybridization performed for additional selected genes validated the changes identified through microarray analysis. Altogether, the affected genes belonged to numerous molecular pathways and cellular/organismal functions, demonstrating the pleiotropic nature of RA-dependent events. In both tissue samples, genes upregulated were more numerous than those down regulated, probably due to feedback regulatory loops. Bioinformatic clustering analysis allowed us to extract groups of genes displaying similar behaviors in mutant tissue samples. These data give an overview of the gene expression changes occurring under a state of embryonic RA deficiency, and provide new candidate genes and pathways for a better understanding of retinoid-dependent molecular events. Two sets of samples were used for analyzing transcriptome changes in Raldh2-/- embryos. The rostral part of the head (including the anterior forebrain, optic vesicles, and overlying tissues), was collected from wild-type and mutant embryos at the 14 somite stage. The posterior tissues were analyzed at the 4 somite stage, and samples were collected from a transverse section plane excluding all tissues from the level of the first branchial arch. .. 14 somite stage;  4 somite stage;  Raldh2 null mutant; Raldh2 -/-;  wild type; Raldh2 +/+;  total RNA;  WT_embryonic brain_posterior;  WT_embryonic brain_rostral;  mutant_embryonic brain_posterior;  mutant_embryonic brain_rostral;  CD1;  10090;  Mus musculus;  embryonic brain;  Rostral/Anterior;  posterior;

Although Meis and Prep behave similarly in vitro, their in vivo activities remain largely unexplored. We show that Prep and Meis interact with largely independent sets of genomic sites and select different DNA binding sequences, with Prep associating mostly with promoters and house-keeping genes and Meis with promoter-remote regions and developmental genes. Hox target sequences associate strongly with Meis but not with Prep binding sites, while Pbx1 cooperates with both Prep and Meis. Accordingly, Meis1 shows strong genetic interaction with Pbx1 but not with Prep1. Meis1 and Prep1 nonetheless co-regulate a subset of genes, predominantly through opposing effects. Notably, the TALE homeoprotein binding profile subdivides Hox clusters into two domains differentially regulated by Meis1 and Prep1. After duplication of the ancestral gene, Meis and Prep thus specialized their interactions but maintained significant regulatory coordination.

It is unknown why this capacity is limited to the area associated with the nail. Here, we show that nail stem cells (NSCs) reside in the Wnt-suppressed proximal nail matrix and that the mechanisms governing NSC differentiation are directly coupled with their ability of orchestrating digit regeneration. Early nail progenitors located distal to the NCS region undergo Wnt-dependent differentiation into nail. Upon amputation, this Wnt activation is required for nail regeneration and also for attracting nerves that promote mesenchymal blastema growth, leading to regeneration of the entire digit. Amputations proximal to the Wnt-active nail progenitors result in failure to regenerate nail/digit. Nevertheless, beta-catenin stabilization in the NSC region induced their regeneration. These results establish a link between NCS differentiation and digit regeneration, suggesting a utility of the NSCs in developing novel treatments for amputees. Nail matrix cells were harvested from proximal and distal matrix region by microdissection and processed to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Mammalian transposon-silencing piRNAs accumulate early in spermatogenesis, whereas pachytene piRNAs are produced later during post-natal spermatogenesis and account for >95% of all piRNAs in the adult mouse testis. Mutants defective for pachytene piRNA pathway proteins fail to produce mature sperm, but neither the piRNA precursor transcripts nor the trigger for pachytene piRNA production is known. Here, we show that the transcription factor A-MYB initiates pachytene piRNA production. A-MYB drives transcription of both pachytene piRNA precursor RNAs and the mRNAs for core piRNA biogenesis factors, including MIWI, the protein through which pachytene piRNAs function. A-MYB regulation of piRNA pathway proteins and piRNA genes creates a coherent feed-forward loop that ensures the robust accumulation of pachytene piRNAs.

At this age mitochondrial function is disrupted in the Schwann cells of Tfam-SCKO mice ,but their nerves display only very limited pathology. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy. Much effort has been devoted to examining the role played by neuronal/axonal mitochondria, but how mitochondrial deficits in peripheral nerve glia (Schwann cells, SCs) contribute to peripheral nerve diseases remains unclear. Here, we investigate a mouse model of peripheral neuropathy secondary to SC mitochondrial dysfunction (Tfam-SCKOs). We show that disruption of SC mitochondria activates a maladaptive integrated stress response through actions of heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI), and causes a shift in lipid metabolism away from fatty acid synthesis toward oxidation. These alterations in SC lipid metabolism result in depletion of important myelin lipid components as well as in accumulation of acylcarnitines, an intermediate of fatty acid b-oxidation. Importantly, we show that acylcarnitines are released from SCs and induce axonal degeneration. A maladaptive integrated stress response as well as altered SC lipid metabolism are thus underlying pathological mechanisms in mitochondria-related peripheral neuropathies. Total RNA samples were prepared by isolating and pooling RNA from three different 2-month-old MPZ-Tfam KO and Ctrl mice. 2 replicates per genotype were used in this experiment and they were prepared entirely independently. .. 2 months;  Bl6 wild type;  MPZ-Tfam KO;  total RNA;  sciatic nerve;  10090;  Mus musculus;  sciatic nerve;

LMD is a technique that allows the extraction of specific cell types, such as colonic epithelial cells, to analyse gene expression. LMD of colon epithelial cells followed by microarray analysis could be of more value than microarray analysis of intact colon for determining which pathways are active in the colon mucosa in the early and late stages of inflammation due to increased sensitivity to changes in specific cell populations. An experiment was performed using microarray analysis of intact colon samples and microdissected colon epithelial cell samples from Il10-/- and C57BL/6J mice at 6 and 12 weeks of age to study the molecular changes that occur in early and late inflammation stages in colon epithelium of a mouse model of colitis. Results showed that intact colon and colon epithelial cell gene expression profiles were similar in terms of pathways between Il10-/- and C57BL/6J mice at 12 weeks of age and between Il10-/- mice at 12 and 6 weeks of age. More immune-related pathways were identified at 6 weeks of age in epithelial cells than intact colon. This suggests that LMD and targeting of specific cell types may be of particular use when studying the early stages of inflammation before the intestinal morphology is detectably altered, by increasing analysis sensitivity to mucosal gene expression changes. 2x2 factorial with two tissue types analysed.

Foxo1 and Foxo3 are highly expressed in granulosa cells of ovarian follicles. Selective depletion of the Foxo1 and Foxo3 genes in granulosa cells revealed a novel ovarian-pituitary endocrine feedback loop characterized by: 1) undetectable levels of serum FSH but not LH, 2) reduced expression of the pituitary Fshb gene and its transcriptional regulators and 3) ovarian production of a factor(s) that suppresses pituitary cell Fshb. Equally notable and independent of FSH, depletion of Foxo1/3 altered the expression of specific genes associated with follicle growth versus apoptosis by disrupting critical regulatory interactions of Foxo1/3 with the activin and BMP2 pathways, respectively.  As a consequence, granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis were decreased.

The regulators of ChP development mediating the acquisition of a fate that differs from the neighboring neuroepithelial cells are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in mice a crucial role for the transcription factor Otx2 in the development and maintenance of ChP cells. Deletion of Otx2 by the Otx2-CreERT2 driver line at E9 resulted in a lack of all ChPs, whereas deletion by the Gdf7-Cre driver line affected predominately the hindbrain ChP, which was reduced in size, primarily owing to an increase in apoptosis upon Otx2 deletion. Strikingly, Otx2 was still required for the maintenance of hindbrain ChP cells at later stages when Otx2 deletion was induced at E15, demonstrating a central role of Otx2 in ChP development and maintenance. Moreover, the predominant defects in the hindbrain ChP mediated by Gdf7-Cre deletion of Otx2 revealed its key role in regulating early CSF composition, which was altered in protein content, including the levels of Wnt4 and the Wnt modulator Tgm2. Accordingly, proliferation and Wnt signaling levels were increased in the distant cerebral cortex, suggesting a role of the hindbrain ChP in regulating CSF composition, including key signaling molecules. Thus, Otx2 acts as a master regulator of ChP development, thereby influencing one of the principal sources of signaling in the developing brain, the CSF.

In an effort to identify the identity of the tissue specific clock that is responsible for this infertility, we used the steroidogenic factor-1 (Sf1) promoter to drive Cre-mediated recombination and genetically delete Bmal1 within cells of the reproductive axis. We show that Bmal1 within the reproductive axis of females is essential for normal fertility through its role in maintaining implantation, but is not required for normal estrous cycling. At the root of this biology appears to be a defect in the regulation of ovarian steroidogenic acute regulator (StAR) and its role in maintaining progesterone synthesis. This conclusion is based upon three observations.  First, that deletion of Bmal1 within the reproductive axis leads to lower levels of StAR mRNA, and lower progesterone levels.  Second, that progesterone supplementation of these conditional mutants rescues implantation. Third, transplantation of wild type ovaries into Bmal1 reproductive axis mutants results in 100% fertility.  Our study suggests that ovarian Bmal1 is an essential peripheral clock governing implantation and fertility in female mice.

We previously proposed NXF5 to be involved in cognitive development and aimed to study its functional role further using a mouse model. The syntenic region of the human Xcen-GLA-NXF5-NXF2-NXF3-BEX4-Xqter in the mouse is Xcen-Gla-Nxf2-Nxf7-Nxf3-Bex4-Xqter strongly indicating that mouse Nxf2 is the homolog of human NXF5. However, our functional analyses demonstrated that mouse Nxf7 is actually the functional homolog  of NXF5. Both orthologs are expressed in brain, although at low levels, show predominant cytoplasmic localization, and present a granular staining in neuronal dendrites, all indicative for a role in cytoplasmic mRNA transport or metabolism. The mouse and human Nxf2/NXF2 proteins on the other hand, show highest expression in testis, and mostly nuclear staining with incorporation in the nuclear membrane, suggesting a predominant role in nuclear mRNA export. Based on these findings we generated an Nxf7 knockout mouse, which was viable and fertile and no gross anatomical changes or morphological brain abnormalities were detected. Detailed behavioral analysis demonstrated that Nxf7 KO mice displayed a deficit in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory. At the cellular level, this was accompanied by impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation, but normal long-term depression, suggesting a severe functional imbalance in NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that NXF5, and its murine ortholog Nxf7, play a crucial role in neurocognitive (memory) functions, and explain why its deletion leads to intellectual disability. Two male wild type (WT1 and WT2) and two Nxf7 knockout (KO1 and KO2) mice were used in each hybridization experiment (hippocampus or cortex).

However, our previous studies using Kit mutant (Kit W/Wv) mast cell-deficient mice demonstrated that mast cells residing in the dura mater and pia mater exacerbate the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the rodent model of the CNS demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis. These data suggest that the meninges are sites of active immune responses in disease. Gene expression profiles of meningeal tissue from wild type and mast cell deficient mice prior to and at day 6 post-EAE induction were found highly distinct. Increases in both mast cell- and neutrophil-associated transcripts were among the notable disease-related changes observed in wild type mice. Kinetic analyses show that meningeal mast cells are activated within 24 hours of disease induction to express multiple mediators including IL-1b and TNF as well as the neutrophil chemoattractant, CXCL2, an observation corresponding with an influx of neutrophils to the meninges. Neutrophil recruitment as well as the disease-related loss of BBB integrity is dependent on mast cell-derived TNF. These data provide unequivocal evidence that the meninges are sites of early inflammatory events in EAE. Mast cells residing within these tissues promote disease by orchestrating an early and efficient immune cell co-localization resulting in a robust local inflammatory response and a breach of the proximal BBB. We hypothesize that these events reflect an aberrant manifestation of the normal immune surveillance role of the meninges in infection settings. Immunized WT and Kit W/Wv mice were sacrificed on Day 6 post-immunization and perfused with PBS as were naive littermate control mice. The dura mater was immediately removed from the calvarium of the skull and pooled (10 mice/group, 4 groups). RNA was isolated using SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega).

They participate in formation of the epidermal barrier, which protects against dehydration and inflammation. Mutations in KRT1 cause keratinopathic ichthyosis with erythema, recurrent inflammation, and barrier defects. Here, we show that genetic deletion of Krt1 in mice causes a defective inside-out epidermal barrier, pre- and postnatal increases in Mrp8/Mrp14, interleukin (IL) 18, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in skin extracts, and systemic release of IL-18 into newborn serum. Perinatal lethality was partially rescued by treatment with glucocorticoids to promote barrier repair or with IL- 18-blocking antibodies in utero. In human keratinocytes, IL-18 release was cellautonomous and caspase-1-dependent, indicating KRT1-dependent inflammasome activation. Our data reveal a novl function of KRT1 in controlling inflammasome activity and stimulating barrier formation, thereby integrating the keratin cytoskeleton into the epidermal immune response. In view of their widespread expression, keratins merit investigation of their functions in inflammatory conditions, including asthma and inflammatory bowel disorders.

This period coincides with photoreceptor terminal differentiation in a normal retina. We have used the rd1 retina as a model to investigate early molecular defects in developing rod photoreceptors prior to the onset of degeneration. Using a microarray approach, we performed gene profiling comparing rd1 and wild type retinas at four time points starting at P2, prior to any obvious biochemical or morphological differences, and concluding at P8, prior to the initiation of cell death. We have identified genes that are differentially regulated in the rd1 retina at early time points, which may give insights into developmental defects that precede photoreceptor cell death. This is the first report of PRA1 expression in the retina. Our data support the hypothesis that PRA1 plays an important role in vesicular trafficking between the Golgi and cilia in differentiating and mature rod photoreceptors.

Thus, drugs that retard the aging process are highly desirable.  Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) is a hormone secreted by the liver during fasting that elicits diverse aspects of the adaptive starvation response.  Among its effects, FGF21 induces hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, increases insulin sensitivity and blocks somatic growth.  Here we show that transgenic overexpression of FGF21 markedly extends lifespan in mice without reducing food intake or affecting AMP kinase or mTOR signaling or NAD metabolism.  Transcriptomic analysis suggests that FGF21 acts primarily by blunting the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling pathway in liver.   These findings raise the possibility that FGF21 can be used as a hormone therapy to extend lifespan.

This protein is suggested to serve in tumor suppression, anti-aging, modification of oxidative stress, protein transport/degradation in cells, and other phenomena. However, the physiological function of SeBP1 remains obscure because of lack of definitive evidence. To address this issue, we compared gene expression between wild-type and SeBP1-knockout (KO) mice using DNA microarray analysis. The results obtained in this study revealed that the deletion of SeBP1 causes a lot of changes in the expression of proliferation-related genes, including a decrease in myelocytomatosis oncogene and an increase in adenomatosis polyposis coli and tumor necrosis factor. Thus, it is suggested that SeBP1 plays a role in the proliferative and/or anti-proliferative effect via the regulation of these genes.

To what extent aging-related changes in the intestinal system contribute to the impaired health of the aging body is still under debate. Young (4 months) and old (21 months) male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control low-fat (10E%) or a high-fat diet (45E%) for 2 weeks. During the intervention gross energy intake and energy excretion in the feces were measured. After sacrifice the small and large intestine were isolated whereby the small intestine was divided in three equal parts. Of each of the isolated segments Swiss rolls were prepared for histological analysis and the luminal content was isolated to examine alterations in the microflora with 16S rRNA Q-PCR. Furthermore, mucosal scrapings were isolated from each segment to determine differential gene expression by microarray analysis and global DNA methylation by pyrosequencing. Digestible energy intake was similar between the two age groups on both the control and the high-fat diet implying that macronutrient metabolism is not affected in 21-month-old mice. This observation was supported by the fact that the microarray analysis on RNA from intestinal scrapings showed no marked changes in expression of genes involved in metabolic processes. Decreased expression of Cubilin was observed in the intestine of 21-month-old mice, which might contribute to aging-induced vitamin B12 deficiency. Furthermore, microarray data analysis revealed enhanced expression of a high number of genes involved in immune response and inflammation in the colon, but not in the small intestine of the 21-month-old mice. Aging-induced global hypomethylation was observed in the colon and the distal part of the small intestine, but not in the first two sections of the small intestine. In 21-month old mice the most pronounced effects of aging was observed in the colon, limited changes were observed in the small intestine. Young (4M) and old (21M) wild type C57BL/6J mice were fed a low-fat diet or high-fat diet for 2 weeks.

The septum (including lateral and medial portions) is a brain region previously linked to various emotional and motivational processes, including maternal care. In this study, we used microarrays (PLIER algorithm) to examine gene expression changes in the septum of postpartum mice and employed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify possible regulators of altered gene expression. Genes of interest identified as differentially regulated with microarray analysis were validated with quantitative real-time PCR. We found that fatty acid binding protein 7 (Fabp7) and galanin (Gal) were downregulated, whereas insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (Igfbp3) was upregulated in postpartum mice compared to virgin females. These genes were previously found to be differentially regulated in other brain regions during lactation. We also identified altered expression of novel genes not previously linked to maternal behavior, but that could play a role in postpartum processes, including glutamate-ammonia ligase (Glul) and somatostatin receptor 1 (Sstr1) (both upregulated in postpartum). Genes implicated in metabolism, cell differentiation, or proliferation also exhibited altered expression. Unexpectedly, enrichment analysis revealed a high number of microRNAs, transcription factors, or conserved binding sites (177 with corrected P-value <0.05) that were significantly linked to maternal upregulated genes, while none were linked to downregulated genes. MicroRNAs have been linked to placenta and mammary gland development, but this is the first indication they may also play a key role in sculpting the maternal brain. Together, this study provides new insights into genes (along with possible mechanisms for their regulation) that are involved in septum-mediated adaptations during the postpartum period. In total, 12 total RNA samples derived from microdissected lateral septum were used for microarray analysis: 6 samples from virgin mice and 6 samples from age-matched lactating maternal mice.

Therapeutic studies in mouse LN models do not always predict outcomes of human therapeutic trials, raising concerns about the human relevance of these models. In this study we used an unbiased transcriptional network approach to define similarities and differences between three lupus models and human LN. Affymetrix-based expression profiles were analyzed using Genomatix Bibliosphere software and transcriptional networks were compared using the Tool for Approximate LargE graph matching (TALE).  The 20 network hubs (nodes) shared between all three models and human LN reflect key pathologic processes, namely immune cell infiltration/activation, macrophage/dendritic cell activation, endothelial cell activation/injury and tissue remodeling/fibrosis. Each model also shares unique features with human LN. Pathway analysis of the TALE nodes highlighted macrophage/DC activation as a cross-species shared feature. To distinguish which genes and activation pathways might derive from mononuclear phagocytes in the human kidneys the gene expression profile of isolated NZB/W renal mononuclear cells was compared with human LN kidney profiles. Network analysis of the shared signature highlighted NFkappaB1 and PPARgamma as major hubs in the tubulointerstitial and glomerular networks respectively. Key nodes in the renal macrophage inflammatory response form the basis for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies. We used microarrays to analyze the renal transcriptome of three different lupus mouse models, at early stage of lupus and during lupus nephritis.

Here, we report biocompatibility and wide-spread functional expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator TN-XXL in a transgenic mouse model. To validate the model and to characterize potential effects of indicator expression we assessed both indicator function and a variety of host parameters such as anatomy, physiology, behavior and gene expression profiles in these mice. We also demonstrate the usefulness of primary cell types and organ explants prepared from these mice for imaging applications. While we do find mild signatures of indicator expression that may guide further indicator development the "green" indicator mice generated provide a well characterized resource of primary cells and tissues for in vitro and in vivo calcium imaging applications. Using expression profiling we could detect a number of transcripts regulated predominantly in heart and skeletal muscle of TN-XXL transgenic mice but only very few showed a level of regulation of a factor of two or higher and thus the majority of these changes were considered physiologically irrelevant. Remarkably this regulation occurred in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but not in brain. This suggests that skeletal muscle TnC as calcium sensing moiety within the indicator may be bio-orthogonal in brain but may lose some of this advantage in muscle tissue where it is derived from.

We show that FGF1 is highly induced in adipose tissue in response to high-fat diet (HFD) and that mice lacking FGF1 develop an aggressive diabetic phenotype coupled to aberrant adipose expansion when challenged with HFD. Mechanistically, we show that transcription of FGF1 is directly regulated by an adipocyte-selective proximal PPAR response element, and that this PPARgamma-FGF1 axis is evolutionarily conserved in mammals.

Mice lacking Klf1 die in utero prior to E15 from severe anemia due to the inadequate expression of genes controlling hemoglobin production, cell membrane and cytoskeletal integrity, and the cell cycle and proliferation. We have recently described the full repertoire of Klf1 binding sites in vivo by performing Klf1 ChIP-seq in primary erythroid tissue (E14.5 fetal liver). Here we describe the Klf1-dependent erythroid transcriptome by comparing mRNA-seq from Klf1+/+ and Klf1-/- erythroid tissue. This has revealed novel target genes not previously obtainable by traditional microarray technology and provided novel insights into the function of Klf1 as a transcriptional activator such as interactions with Gata1, Scl/Tal1 and p300. We also describe a set of erythroid specific promoters not previously identified that drive high level expression of otherwise ubiquitously expressed genes in erythroid cells. Additionally, our study has identified for the first time two novel lnc-RNAs that are dynamically expressed during erythroid differentiation as well as a role for Klf1 in directing apoptotic gene expression to drive the terminal stages of erythroid maturation.

To facilitate the identification of genes associated with cataract, we developed iSyTE (integrated Systems Tool for Eye gene discovery; http://bioinformatics.udel.edu/Research/iSyTE). iSyTE contains microarray gene expression profiles of the mouse embryonic lens as it transitions from the stage of placode invagination to that of vesicle formation. We identified differentially regulated genes by comparing lens microarray profiles to those representing whole embryonic body (WB) without ocular tissue. These were then utilized to generate a ranked list of lens-genes enrichment, which can be viewed as iSyTE tracks in the UCSC Genome browser to aid identification of genes with lens function. We microdissected embryonic lens from mice at E10.5, E11.5, and E12.5 (triplicate at each time point). To have a proper control, we also generated gene expression profiles of whole embryonic body (WB) at these time points. For comparative analysis, we also generated gene expression profiles of E13.5 tooth germs tissues, and matched WB. These profiles are used to identify lens and tooth specific gene expression enrichment at these embryonic time points.

Loss of MeCP2 function causes Rett syndrome (RTT), whereas increased MeCP2 dosage causes MECP2 duplication or triplication syndromes. MeCP2 acts as a transcriptional repressor, however, the gene expression changes observed in the hypothalamus and cerebellum of MeCP2 disorder mouse models suggest that MeCP2 can also upregulate gene expression. In this study, we compared gene expression changes in the amygdalae of mice lacking MeCP2 (Mecp2-null) and mice overexpressing MeCP2 (MECP2-TG).  We chose the amygdala because it is a neuroanatomical region implicated in the control of anxiety and social behavior, two prominent phenotypes in MECP2-TG mice, and hypothesized that transcriptional profiling of this particular brain region may reveal expression changes relevant to heightened anxiety-like behavior and abnormal social behavior.  A total of 1,060 genes were altered in opposite directions in both MeCP2 mouse models compared with wild-type littermates, with ~60% up-regulated and ~40% down-regulated.  Interestingly, we found a significant enrichment of anxiety- and/or social behavior-related genes among the differentially expressed genes.  To determine whether these genes contribute to the anxiety and social behavior phenotypes in MECP2-TG mice, we performed genetic and pharmacologic studies and found that a reduction in Crh suppresses anxiety-like behavior, and a reduction in Oprm1 improves social approach behavior.  These studies suggest that MeCP2 impacts molecular pathways involved in anxiety and social behavior, and provide insight into potential therapies for MeCP2 disorders.

To advance these applications, multiple systems for single-cell RNA extraction in addition to crude cell lysis followed by RNA profiling were examined and used for genomic data analysis. Our results indicate that some of these methods are suitable for analyzing even a portion of the total RNA from a single oocyte or embryo, with low variance among technical replicates across a wide dynamic range of expression. These methods will not only be helpful for genomic and epigenetic research to identify regulatory mechanisms of early development and molecular signatures of embryo classes, but can also provide great potential for clinical analysis of small biopsy samples or pre-implantation genetic disease screening. RNA from single mouse oocytes was purified using Qiagen Rneasy Mini or Arcturus PicoPure kits. Crude lysates of single oocytes were also prepared in NuGEN direct lysis buffer.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a translated CAG repeat in Ataxin-1 (ATXN1). The transcriptional repressor Cic binds directly to Atxn1 and plays a key role in SCA1 pathogenesis. Two isoforms of Cic, long (Cic-L) and short (Cic-S), are transcribed from alternative promoters. Using embryonic stem cells in which the Cic locus was targeted by an insertion of a genetrap cassette between exon 1 of the Cic-L isoform and exon 1 of the Cic-S isoform, we generated mice that carried this allele and backcrossed these onto a Swiss Webster (CD-1) strain for >6 generations. The resulting Cic-L-/- mice completely lack the Cic-L isoform with ~10% of Cic-S remaining. These data were used to compare with previous microarray data to determine the Cic-depedent pathogenic mechanisms in SCA1.

To investigate roles of GW182 in the yolk sac endoderm, we assessed changes in mRNA expression in the yolk sac of E9.5 GW182gt/gt embryos using microarrays (Affymetrix). Yolk sac of wild type littermates and GW182gt/gt embryos at E9.5 was collected for total RNA isolation using Trizol (Invitrogen).

Mitogen Inducible Gene 6 (Mig-6) is an immediate early response gene that can be induced by various mitogens, stresses, and hormones. To identify the metabolic role of Mig-6 in the liver, we conditionally ablated Mig-6 in the liver using the Albumin-Cre mouse model (Albcre/+Mig-6f/f; Mig-6d/d). Mig-6d/d mice exhibit hepatomegaly and fatty liver. Serum levels of total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol and hepatic lipid were significantly increased in the Mig-6d/d mice. The daily excretion of fecal bile acids was significantly decreased in the Mig-6d/d mice. DNA microarray analysis of mRNA isolated from the livers of these mice showed alterations in genes that regulate lipid metabolism, bile acid, and cholesterol synthesis, while the expression of genes that regulate biliary excretion of bile acid and triglyceride synthesis showed no difference in the Mig-6d/d mice compared to Mig-6f/f controls. These results indicate that Mig-6 plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid synthesis. Mice with liver specific conditional ablation of Mig-6 develop hepatomegaly and increased intrahepatic lipid and provide a novel model system to investigate the genetic and molecular events involved in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid synthesis. Defining the molecular mechanisms by which Mig-6 regulates cholesterol homeostasis will provide new insights into the development of more effective ways for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease.

To dissect molecularly this complex structure, we conducted a project, named the BrainStars (B*) project, in which we sampled ~50 small brain regions, including sensory centers and centers for motion, time, memory, fear, and feeding.  To avoid confusion from temporal differences in gene expression, we sampled each region every 4 hours for 24 hours, and pooled the sample sets for DNA-microarray assays. Therefore, we focused only on spatial differences in gene expression. We then used informatics to identify candidates for (1) genes with high or low expression in specific regions, (2) switch-like genes with bimodal or multimodal expression patterns, and (3) genes with a uni-modal expression pattern that exhibit stable or variable levels of expression across brain regions. We used our findings to develop an integrated database (http://brainstars.org/) for exploring genome-wide expression in the adult mouse brain. For 51 CNS regions, slices (0.5-mm thick) of mouse brain were cut on a Mouse Brain Matrix, frozen, and the specific regions were punched out bilaterally with a microdissecting needle (gauge 0.5 mm) under a stereomicroscope.

Although some miRNAs are known to have region-specific expression patterns in the adult brain, the functional consequences of the region-specificity to the gene regulatory networks of the brain nuclei are not clear. Therefore, we studied miRNA expression patterns by miRNA-seq in two brain regions, frontal cortex (FCx) and hippocampus (HP), which have separate biological functions. We identified 354 miRNA from FCx and 408 from HP. Several miRNA families and clusters were differentially expressed between FCx and HP, including the miR-8 family, miR-182 miR-96 miR-183 cluster, and miR-212 miR-312 cluster overexpressed in FCx and miR-34 family overexpressed in HP. To visualize the clusters, we developed support for viewing genomic alignments of miRNA-seq reads in the Chipster genome browser. We carried out pathway analysis of the predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNA families and clusters to assess their putative biological functions. Interestingly, specific pathways were identified that are predicted to be regulated by several miRNAs from the same family/cluster. We have developed a miRNA-seq approach with a bioinformatic analysis workflow that is suitable for studying miRNA expression patterns from specific brain nuclei. FCx and HP were shown to have distinct miRNA expression patterns which were reflected in the predicted gene regulatory pathways.

Methods: Laser-capture-microdissection was used to collect conjunctival forniceal epithelial cells from postnatal-day (PN) 9, PN14 and PN20 wild-type (WT), and PN14 Klf4-conditional null (Klf4CN) mice, where goblet cells are absent, developing, present, and missing, respectively. Microarrays were used to compare gene expression among these four groups. Expression of selected genes was validated by Q-RT-PCR, and spatiotemporal expression assessed by in situ hybridization.  Results: We identified 668, 251, 1160 and 139 genes that were upregulated and 492, 377, 1419 and 57 genes that were downregulated between PN9 and PN14, PN14 and PN20, PN9 and PN20, and PN14 WT and Klf4CN conjunctiva, respectively. Transcription factors Spdef, FoxA1 and FoxA3 that regulate goblet cell development in other mucosal epithelia, and epithelial specific Ets (ESE) transcription factor family members were upregulated during conjunctival development. Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) was favored and diverse pathways related to glycoprotein biosynthesis, mucosal immunity, signaling, endocytic and neural regulation were affected during conjunctival development. Conjunctival Klf4-target genes differed significantly from the previously identified corneal Klf4-target genes, implying tissue-dependant regulatory targets for Klf4. Conclusions: We have identified the changes in gene expression accompanying mouse conjunctival development and the role of Klf4 in this process. These studies provide new probes to study conjunctival epithelial development and function, and reveal that the gene regulatory network required for goblet cell development is conserved across different mucosal epithelia.

Our methods successfully subdivided eyes with no detectable glaucoma by conventional assays into molecularly defined stages of disease. These stages represent a temporally ordered sequence of glaucoma states. Using an array of tools, we then determined networks and biological processes that are altered at these early stages. Our strategy proved very sensitive, suggesting that similar approaches will be valuable for uncovering early processes in other complex, later-onset diseases. Early changes included upregulation of both the complement cascade and endothelin system, and so we tested the therapeutic value of separately inhibiting them. Mice with a mutation in the complement component 1a gene (C1qa) were robustly protected from glaucoma with the protection being among the greatest reported. Similarly, inhibition of the endothelin system was strongly protective. Since EDN2 is potently vasoconstrictive and was produced by microglial/macrophages, our data provide a novel link between these cell types and vascular dysfunction in glaucoma. Targeting early events such as the upregulation of the complement and endothelin pathways may provide effective new treatments for human glaucoma. Genome-wide assessment of gene expression changes was performed in DBA/2J mice. The optic nerve head and retina from 40 DBA/2J eyes at 10.5 months of age were separately profiled. These eyes were selected as they encompassed a range of glaucoma severity.

In the current study, genome-wide association (GWA) and co-expression network analysis was used in the recently described Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) to identify and functionally characterize novel BMD genes.  In the HMDP, a GWA of total body, spinal and femoral BMD revealed four significant associations (-log10P > 5.39) affecting at least one BMD trait on chromosomes (Chrs.) 7, 11, 12 and 17.  The associations implicated a total of 163 genes with each association harboring between 14 and 112 genes.  This list was reduced to 26 functional candidates by identifying those genes that were regulated by local eQTL in bone or harbored potentially functional non-synonymous (NS) SNPs.  This analysis revealed that the most significant BMD SNP on Chr. 12 was a NS SNP in the additional sex combs like-2 (Asxl2) gene that was predicted to be functional.   The involvement of Asxl2 in the regulation of bone mass was confirmed by the observation that Asxl2 knockout mice had reduced BMD.  To begin to unravel the mechanism though which Asxl2 influenced BMD, a gene co-expression network was created using cortical bone gene expression microarray data from the HMDP strains.  Asxl2 was identified as a member of a co-expression gene module enriched for genes involved in the differentiation of myeloid cells.  In bone, osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cell of myeloid origin, suggesting that Asxl2 may play a role in osteoclast differentiation.  In agreement, the knockdown of Asxl2 in bone marrow macrophages impaired their ability to form osteoclasts.  This study identifies a new regulator of BMD and osteoclastogenesis and highlights the power of GWA and systems genetics in the mouse for dissecting complex genetic traits.

The function of this SNF-2 like ATPase has been studied mainly in yeast and human cells, which has revealed that it binds directly to TBP, forming the B-TFIID complex. This complex binds to core promoters of RNA polymerase II- transcribed genes and, of crucial importance, BTAF1-TBP interactions have been shown to affect the kinetics of TBP-promoter interactions. Here we report the isolation of a mouse line carrying a Btaf1 allele containing an ENU-induced point mutation that causes a substitution mutation in the BTAF1 ATPase domain. Embryos homozygous for this loss-of-function mutation appear to be morphologically normal until early somite stages, but die between embryonic day 9 and 10.5 displaying growth arrest and edema.  Analyses in vitro suggest that the altered protein is less stable and, independent from this, functionally impaired in releasing of TBP from chromatin, but not in binding to TBP. A microarray screen for genes with altered expression in the Btaf V1330M mutant as compared to WT embryos was performed with RNA from whole embryos. We compared mRNA transcripts from pools of Btaf1-/- and Btaf1+/+ embryos. Where possible, we used 3-5-somite embryos, a stage we considered to be immediately prior to the emergence of a perceptible phenotype. The experiments were done in duplo, i.e. two sets of comparisons were made:  in one case stage matching (i.e. number of somites counted) was the highest priority, in the other case the pools were designed such that a maximum number of litter mates were compared while a difference of up to five somites was allowed.  cDNAs were synthesized and Cy-3/Cy-5 labeled cRNAs were generated by using a Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The labeled cRNAs were hybridized on 4X44K Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Dual Color Microarrays (G4122F). Two dye-swap experiments were performed, resulting in four individual arrays. Microarray signal and background information were retrieved with Feature Extraction (V9.5.3, Agilent technologies).

Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF- kappaB) transcription factors play a critical role in atrophy.  Knockout of genes encoding p50 or the NF- kappaB co-transactivator, Bcl-3, abolish disuse atrophy and thus they are NF- kappaB factors required for disuse atrophy.  We do not know however, the genes targeted by NF- kappaB that produce the atrophied phenotype.  Here we identify the genes required to produce disuse atrophy using gene expression profiling in wild type compared to Nfkb1 (gene encodes p50) and Bcl-3 deficient mice.  There were 185 and 240 genes upregulated in wild type mice due to unloading, that were not upregulated in Nfkb1-/- and Bcl-3-/- mice, respectively, and so these genes were considered direct or indirect targets of p50 and Bcl-3.  All of the p50 gene targets were contained in the Bcl-3 gene target list.  Most genes were involved with protein degradation, signaling, translation, transcription, and transport.  To identify direct targets of p50 and Bcl-3 we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of selected genes previously shown to have roles in atrophy.  Trim63 (MuRF1), Fbxo32 (MAFbx), Ubc, Ctsl, Runx1, Tnfrsf12a (Tweak receptor), and Cxcl10 (IP-10) showed increased Bcl-3 binding to  kappaB sites in unloaded muscle and thus were direct targets of Bcl-3.  p50 binding to the same sites on these genes either did not change or increased, supporting the idea of p50:Bcl-3 binding complexes.  p65 binding to kappaB sites showed decreased or no binding to these genes with unloading.  Fbxo9, Psma6, Psmc4, Psmg4, Foxo3, Ankrd1 (CARP), and Eif4ebp1 did not show changes in p65, p50, or Bcl-3 binding to  kappaB sites, and so were considered indirect targets of p50 and Bcl-3.

XCI is orchestrated by Xist RNA, whose expression in early development leads to transcriptional silencing of one X-chromosome in the female. Knockout studies have established a requirement for Xist, with inviability of female embryos that inherit an Xist deletion from the father. Here, we report that female mice lacking Xist RNA can, surprisingly, develop and survive to term. Xist-null females are born at lower frequency and are smaller at birth, but organogenesis is mostly normal. Transcriptomic analysis indicates significant overexpression of hundreds of X-linked genes across multiple tissues. Therefore, Xist-null mice can develop to term in spite of a deficiency of dosage compensation. However, the degree of X-autosomal dosage imbalance was less than anticipated (1.14- to 1.36-fold). Thus, partial dosage compensation can be achieved without Xist, supporting the idea of inherent genome balance. Nevertheless, to date, none of the mutant mice has survived beyond weaning stage. Sudden death is associated with failure of postnatal organ maturation. Our data suggest Xist-independent mechanisms of dosage compensation and demonstrate that small deviations from X-autosomal balance can have profound effects on overall fitness.

Stimuli that promote actin polymerization allow for shuttling of MRTFs to the nucleus where they activate serum response factor (SRF), a regulator of actin and other cytoskeletal protein genes.  SRF is an essential regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation and numerous components of the muscle sarcomere, but the potential involvement of MRTFs in skeletal muscle development has not been examined. We explored the role of MRTFs in muscle development in vivo by generating mutant mice harboring a skeletal muscle-specific deletion of MRTF-B and a global deletion of MRTF-A. These double knockout (dKO) mice were able to form sarcomeres during embryogenesis. However, the sarcomeres were abnormally small and disorganized, causing skeletal muscle hypoplasia and perinatal lethality. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated dramatic dysregulation of actin genes in MRTF dKO mice, highlighting the importance of MRTFs in actin cycling and myofibrillogenesis. MRTFs were also necessary for the survival of skeletal myoblasts and for the efficient formation of intact myotubes. Our findings reveal a central role for MRTFs in sarcomere formation during skeletal muscle development and point to the potential involvement of these transcriptional coactivators in skeletal myopathies.

However, this model is inappropriate for testing new therapies due to its mild phenotype. Here, we transferred the mdx mutation to the 129/Sv strain with the aim to create a more severe model for DMD. Unexpectedly, functional analysis of the first three generations of mdx129 showed a progressive amelioration of the phenotype, associated to less connective tissue replacement, and more regeneration than the original mdxC57BL. Transcriptome comparative analysis was performed to identify what is protecting this new model from the dystrophic characteristics. The mdxC57BL presents three times more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than the mdx129 (371 and 137 DEGs, respectively). However, both models present more overexpressed genes than underexpressed, indicating that the dystrophic and regenerative alterations are associated with the activation rather than repression of genes. As to functional categories, the DEGs of both mdx models showed a predominance of immune system genes. Excluding this category, the mdx129 model showed a decreased participation of the endo/exocytic pathway and homeostasis categories, and an increased participation of the extracellular matrix and enzymatic activity categories. Spp1 gene overexpression was the most significant DEG exclusively expressed in the mdx129 strain. This was confirmed through relative mRNA analysis and osteopontin protein quantification. The amount of the 66 kDa band of the protein, representing the post-translational product of the gene, was about 4.8 times higher on Western blotting. Spp1 is a known DMD prognostic biomarker, and our data indicate that its upregulation can benefit phenotype. Modeling the expression of the DEGs involved in the mdx mutation with a benign course should be tested as a possible therapeutic target for the dystrophic process. We analyzed calf muscles from five Dmdmdx, three hybrids of Dmdmdx with 129/Sv in generations F1, F2 and F3; five C57BL/6 and three 129/Sv as normal controls. All animals were six months old. We used the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST platform. Array data was processed by Expression Console.

The goals of this study were firstly, to identify ADAR1-specific RNA-editing sites by indentifying A-to-I (G) RNA editing sites in wild type mice that were not edited or reduced in editing frequency in ADAR1 deficient murine erythroid cells. Secondly, to determine the transcription consequence of an absence of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing. Methods: Total RNA from E14.5 fetal liver of embryos with an erythroid restricted deletion of ADAR1 (KO) and littermate controls (WT), in duplicate. cDNA libraries were prepared and RNA sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT-PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. A-to-I (G) RNA editing sites were identified as previously described by Ramaswami G. et al., Nature Methods, 2012 using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA). RNA editing sites were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 14,484 transcripts in the fetal livers of WT and ADAR1E861A mice with BWA. RNA-seq data had a goodness of fit (R2) of >0.7, p<0.0001 between biological duplicates per genotype. Clusters of hyper-editing were onserved in long, unannotated 3'UTRs of erythroid specific transcripts. A profound upregulation of interferon stimulated genes were found to be massively upregulated (up to 5 log2FC) in KO fetal liver compared to WT. 11.332 (6,894 novel) A-to-I RNA editing sites were identified when assessing mismatches in RNA-seq data. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of erythroid transcriptomes and A-to-I RNA editing sites, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. A-to-I RNA editing is the essential function of ADAR1 and is required to prevent sensing of endogenous transcripts, likely via a RIG-I like receptor mediated axis.

However, the availability of NAD in several tissues can become limited during genotoxic stress and the course of natural aging. The point at which NAD restriction imposes functional limitations on tissue physiology remains unknown. We examined this question in murine skeletal muscle by specifically depleting Nampt, an essential enzyme in the NAD salvage pathway. Knockout mice exhibited a dramatic 85% decline in intramuscular NAD content, accompanied by fiber degeneration and progressive loss of both muscle strength and treadmill endurance. Administration of the NAD precursor nicotinamide riboside rapidly ameliorated functional deficits and restored muscle mass, despite having only a modest effect on the intramuscular NAD pool. Additionally, lifelong overexpression of Nampt preserved muscle NAD levels and exercise capacity in aged mice, supporting a critical role for tissue-autonomous NAD homeostasis in maintaining muscle mass and function. Messenger RNA was isolated from quadriceps muscle of mice from three different age groups and three different genotypes. Wildtype mice were aged 4, 7, and 24 months. Mice deficient for Nampt in skeletal muscle (mNKO) were aged 7 months. Mice overexpressing Nampt in skeletal muscle were aged 4 and 24 months. .. 24 months;  4 months;  7 months;  C57BL/6;  deficient for Nampt in skeletal muscle;  overexpressing Nampt in skeletal muscle;  wild type;  polyA RNA;  Quadricep muscle;  10090;  Mus musculus;  quadricep muscle;  Mice were occassionally subjected to glucose and exercise tolerance tests before sacrifice.;

The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: our data suggest that circular RNAs identified based on junction sequences in the RNA-seq reads, especially those from Illumina Hiseq sequencing, mostly result from template-switching events during reverse transcription by MMLV-derived reverse transcriptases.  It is critical to employ reverse transcriptases lacking terminal transferase activity (e.g., MonsterScript) to construct sequencing library or perform RT-PCR for identification and quantification of true circular RNAs. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of retinal transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue.

To identify down stream target genes of Glis3, we performed microarray analysis using pancreas total RNAs from 1 week-old WT and Glis3KO2 mice.  insulin and pancreatic polypeptide (Ppy) was significantly decreased together with several other beta cell markers, Glut2 and MafA by microarray analysis. Immunohistochemistry, QRT-PCR, and transmission electron microscopy indicated that postnatal Glis3KO2 pancreas still contains a large population of beta cells that express Pdx-1, Nkx6.1, and Isl-1; however, insulin production and secretory granules were greatly reduced in these cells. In addition, chromogranin A (ChgA) and Urocortin 3, which are associated with mature beta cells, was dramatically decreased in Glis3KO2 pancreas. These observations suggest that Glis3 plays a critical role in the maturation of pancreatic beta cell phenotype. Pancreatic total RNAs were purified from 4 WT and 4 Glis3KO2 at 1 week old age.

To understand the role of hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation on this process, we generated mice with a liver-specific knockout of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2L-/-), an obligate step in mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation.  Surprisingly, Cpt2L-/- mice survived the perinatal period and a 24hr fast with sufficient blood glucose.  The loss of hepatic fatty acid oxidation resulted in a significant loss in circulating ketones that remained unaltered by fasting.  Fasting induced serum dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis and adaptations in hepatic and systemic oxidative gene expression in Cpt2L-/- mice to maintain systemic energy homeostasis.  Alternatively, feeding a ketogenic diet resulted in severe hepatomegaly, liver damage and death within one week with a complete absence of adipose triglyceride stores.  These data show that hepatic fatty acid oxidation is not required for survival during acute food deprivation but essential for constraining adipocyte lipolysis and regulating systemic catabolism when glucose is limiting. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected mouse liver from mice fasted for 24 hours with and without the deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (i.e. hepatocytes unable to beta-oxidize long chain fatty acids in mitochondria).

To investigate these pathways we   analyzed the brain of B6J-nmf205-/-   mice in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA   codons due to deficiencies in a tRNA  Arg(UCU) tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor.   Increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2alpha (Ser51) were detected prior to neurodegeneration in these   mice and transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the   integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Genetic experiments showed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2alpha kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Further we found that the ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in B6J-nmf205-/-   mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway.   These results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress.

FBXL10 is expressed as two isoforms: FBXL10-1, a longer form that contains an N-terminal JmjC domain with C- terminal F-box, CXXC, PHD, RING, and leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains, and FBXL10-2, a shorter form that initiates at an alternative internal exon and which lacks the JmjC domain but retains the other domains. Selective deletion of Fbxl10-1 had been reported to produce a minor and variable phenotype, and most mutant animals were essentially normal. We show here that deletion of Fbxl10-2 (in a manner that does not perturb expression of Fbxl10-1) resulted in a very different phenotype with craniofacial abnormalities, greatly increased lethality, and female sterility in surviving homozygous mutants. The phenotype of the Fbxl10-2 deletion was more severe in female mutants. We found that mutants that lacked both FBXL10-1 and -2 showed embryonic lethality and even more extreme sexual dimorphism, with more severe gene dysregulation in mutant female embryos. X-linked genes were most severely dysregulated, and there was marked overexpression of Xist in mutant females although genes that encode factors that bind to Xist RNA were globally down-regulated in mutant female as compared to male embryos. FBXL10 is the first factor shown to be required both for the normal expression and function of the Xist gene.

GenePix pro V6.0 is used to read the raw intensity of the image. The intensity of green signal is calculated after background subtraction and four Replicated spots of each probe on the same slide have been calculated the median. We use Median Normalization Method to obtain "Normalized Data", Normalized Data = (Foreground-Background) / median, the median is 50 percent quantile of microRNA intensity which is larger than 50 in all samples after background correction. Results and conclusion: The miRNA expression profiling was completed on our samples. The profiling identified a subset of the total number of miRNAs analyzed by the miRCURY array that are differentially expressed in brown adipose tissue, inguinal adipose tissue, epidydimal adipose tissue, gastrocnemius muscle, and soleus muscle. Tissue microRNA profiles of 2-3-month old mice were generated by microarray, using miRCURY LNA Array. .. post natal month 2-3;  total RNA;  brown adipose tissue;  epidydimal adipose tissue;  gastrocnemius muscle;  inguinal adipose tissue;  soleus muscle;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  brown adipose tissue;  epidydimal adipose tissue;  gastrocnemius muscle;  inguinal adipose tissue;  soleus muscle;

However, this process is highly inefficient and most cloned embryos arrest at certain developmental stages. Through single cell sequencing combined with embryo biopsy, here we generate a global map of DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome for SCNT embryos with distinct developmental fates. We subsequently demonstrate that the unfaithful reactivation of two histone demethylases, Kdm4b and Kdm5b, accounts for the arrest of cloned embryos at 2-cell and 4-cell stage, respectively. Ectopic expression of Kdm4b and Kdm5b in SCNT can remove H3K9me3 barrier, restore the transcription profile and facilitate the blastocyst developmental efficiency over 95%. Moreover, these cloned embryos can further support full-term development and the derivation of SCNT-embryonic stem cells with greater efficiency. Our study reveals that histone methylation reset is crucial for the development of SCNT embryos, which provides a clue to further improve therapeutic cloning.

In fact alternative splicing of the voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1.1 actively suppresses calcium currents in mature muscle. Why this might be necessary is not known. However, splicing defects causing aberrant expression of the calcium-conducting embryonic CaV1.1e splice variant correlate with muscle weakness in myotonic dystrophy. Here we deleted CaV1.1 exon 29 in mice. The continued expression of CaV1.1e resulted in increased calcium influx during EC coupling and spontaneous calcium sparks. While overall motor performance was normal, muscle force was reduced, endurance enhanced, and the fiber type composition shifted toward slower fibers. In contrast, oxidative enzyme activity and the mitochondrial content declined. Together with the dysregulation of key regulators of the slow program these findings indicate that limiting calcium influx during skeletal muscle EC coupling is important for the calcium signal's secondary function in the activity-dependent regulation of fiber type composition.

Here, we use transcriptome profiling to demonstrate that deficiency in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) gene progranulin (Grn) leads to an age-dependent, progressive up-regulation of lysosomal and innate immunity genes, increased complement production, and synaptic pruning activity in microglia. During aging, Grn-/- mice show profound accumulation of microglia and preferential elimination of inhibitory synapses in the ventral thalamus, which contribute to hyperexcitability in the thalamocortical circuits and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-like grooming behaviors. Remarkably, blocking complement activation by deleting C1qa gene significantly reduces synaptic pruning by Grn-/- microglia, and mitigates neurodegeneration, behavioral phenotypes and premature mortality in Grn-/- mice. These results uncover a previously unrecognized role of progranulin in suppressing microglia activation during aging, and support the idea that blocking complement activation is a promising therapeutic target for neurodegeneration caused by progranulin deficiency.

During fermentation and aging of the Kurozu liquid in an earthenware jar over 1 year, solid residue called Kurozu Moromi is produced. In the present study, we evaluated whether concentrated Kurozu or Kurozu Moromi could ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in the senescence accelerated P8 mouse. Senescence accelerated P8 mice were fed 0.25% (w/w) concentrated Kurozu or 0.5% (w/w) Kurozu Moromi for 4 or 25 weeks. Kurozu suppressed cognitive dysfunction and amyloid accumulation in the brain, while Kurozu Moromi showed a tendency to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction, but the effect was not significant. We hypothesize that concentrated Kurozu has an antioxidant effect, however, the level of lipid peroxidation in the brain did not differ in senescence accelerated P8 mice. DNA microarray analysis indicated that concentrated Kurozu increased HSPA1A mRNA expression, a protein that prevents protein misfolding and aggregation. The increase in HSPA1A expression by Kurozu was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR and immunoblotting methods. Therefore, the suppression of amyloid accumulation by concentrated Kurozu may be associated with HSPA1A induction. However, concentrated Kurozu could not increase HSPA1A expression in mouse primary neurons, suggesting it may not directly affect neurons. Ten-times concentrated Kurozu (CK) was made from Kurozu liquid (Sakamoto Kurozu, Fukuyama, Kagoshima, Japan) by repeated vacuum distillation. The CK diet included 0.25% (w/w) CK in CE-2 basic rodent diet (Nihon CLEA, Tokyo, Japan).

The cells clustered into populations of alpha-cells (5%), beta-cells (92%), delta-cells (1%) and PP-cells (2%). We identified cell-type specific transcription factors and pathways primarily involved in nutrient sensing and oxidation and cell signaling. Unexpectedly, 281 cells had to be removed from the analysis due to low viability (23%), low sequencing quality (13%) or contamination resulting in the detection of more than one islet hormone (64%). Collectively, we provide a resource for identification of high-quality gene expression datasets to help expand insights into genes and pathways characterizing islet cell types.

However, acquired resistance to TKIs is a significant clinical problem in CML, and TKI therapy is much less effective against Ph+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). BCR-ABL1, via phosphorylated Tyr177, recruits the adapter GAB2 as part of a GRB2/GAB2 complex. We showed previously that GAB2 is essential for BCR-ABL1-evoked myeloid transformation in vitro. Using a genetic strategy and mouse models of CML and B-ALL, we show here that GAB2 is essential for myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis by BCR-ABL1. In the mouse model, recipients of BCR-ABL1-transduced Gab2-/- bone marrow failed to develop CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia. Leukemogenesis was restored by expression of GAB2 but not by GAB2 mutants lacking binding sites for its effectors PI3K or SHP2. GAB2 deficiency also attenuated BCR-ABL1-induced B-ALL, but only the SHP2 binding site was required. The SHP2 and PI3K binding sites were differentially required for signaling downstream of GAB2. Hence, GAB2 transmits critical transforming signals from Tyr177 to PI3K and SHP2 for CML pathogenesis, whereas only the GAB2-SHP2 pathway is essential for lymphoid leukemogenesis.

Removal of Siglec-E causes the development of exaggerated signs of aging at the molecular, structural, and cognitive level. We found that accelerated aging was related both to an unbalanced ROS metabolism, and to a secondary impairment in detoxification of reactive molecules, ultimately leading to increased damage to cellular DNA, proteins and lipids. Taken together, our data suggest that CD33rSiglecs co-evolved in mammals to achieve a better management of oxidative stress during inflammation, which in turn reduces molecular damage and extends lifespan.

In mice, paternal consumption of low protein diet alters cholesterol and lipid metabolism of progeny. Here, we examine RNA species expressed in male reproductive tissues of mice. Protein restriction leads to altered levels of multiple small RNAs in mature sperm, as well as throughout the male reproductive tract, with decreased levels of let-7 family members and increased levels of 5' fragments of tRNA-Gly isoacceptors. Intriguingly, tRNA fragments are scarce in the testis, but their levels increase in sperm during post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. We find that epididymosomes - extracellular vesicles which fuse with sperm during epididymal transit - exhibit RNA payloads closely matching those of mature sperm, and can deliver tRNA fragments to immature sperm in vitro both in mouse and in bull. Finally, we show that tRNA-Gly-GCC fragments play a role in repressing genes associated with the endogenous retroelement MERVL, both in ES cells and in preimplantation embryos. Our results shed light on small RNA biogenesis during post-testicular sperm maturation, and link tRNA fragments to regulation of endogenous retroelements active in the early embryo.

Embryos lacking endothelial rudhira die at mid-gestation with vascular patterning defects. Rudhira mutant yolk sac endothelial cells show slow and random migration. So to identify key signaling pathways perturbed in the absence of rudhira, we undertook whole transcriptome based analysis of gene expression in rudhira null yolk sac and embryo. Transcriptome analysis shows that key mediators of angiogenesis, cell adhesion, migration and extracellular matrix degradation as well as several components of the TGFbeta pathway are perturbed in rudhira null mutant yolk sacs at 9.5 dpc. We used two embryo samples ( 2E- wild type; 5E- rudhira mutant). Repetition was done on each sample. We used 4 yolk sac samples (3Y,4Y- wild type; 7Y,8Y-rudhira mutant) for the analysis.

The mouse model lacking Amacr can produce only minor (less than 10%) amounts of bile acids, but still they are symptomless in normal laboratory conditions. Bile acid synthesis occurs in liver.

At the onset of corticogenesis, the first-born progenitors are apical progenitors (APs) whose asymmetric division give birth directly to neurons. Later, they switch to indirect neurogenesis by generating intermediate progenitors (IPs), which give rise to projection neurons of all cortical layers. While a direct lineage relationship between APs and IPs has been established, the molecular mechanism that controls their transition remains elusive. Our data suggest that interfering with codon translation speed triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), further impairing the generation of IPs and leading to microcephaly. Moreover, we demonstrate that a progressive downregulation of UPR in cortical progenitors acts as physiological signal to amplify IPs and promotes indirect neurogenesis. Thus, our findings reveal a hitherto unrecognized contribution of UPR to cell fate acquisition during mammalian brain development.

We identified a 0.23 MB critical interval on chromosome 11  containing only two protein coding genes, Rufy1 and Hnrnph1. Notably, Rufy1 contains three  missense SNPs and Hnrnph1 contains 1 SNP near the 5' UTR. In an effort to identify the molecular  mechanisms that bridge genetic variation with behavior, we conducted transcriptome analysis  via mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in a B6.D2 congenic line (chr.11: 50-60 Mb) that captures the  QTL. There was an overrepresentation of cis-regulated, differentially expressed genes within  the congenic interval (4 out of 92 differentially expressed genes; FDR < 0.05) and widespread  genomic regulation on all autosomes. For this study, 3mm punches from both striatal hemispheres were collected and pooled from 16 mice (8 controls and 8 B6.D2 congenics), and RNA was extracted and prepared for cDNA library preparation using the Illumina TruSeq (oligo-dT; 50bp single-end reads).

Thus, sensory neuron types can be defined by linking transcriptome-based neuron typing with the sensory phenotypes. Here we classify somatosensory neurons of the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by high-coverage single-cell RNA-sequencing (10 950   1 218 genes per neuron) and neuron size-based hierarchical clustering. Moreover, single DRG neurons responding to cutaneous stimuli are recorded using an in vivo whole-cell patch clamp technique and classified by neuron-type genetic markers. Small diameter DRG neurons are classified into one type of low-threshold mechanoreceptor and five types of mechanoheat nociceptors (MHNs). Each of the MHN types is further categorized into two subtypes. Large DRG neurons are categorized into four types, including neurexophilin 1-expressing MHNs and mechanical nociceptors (MNs) expressing BAI1-associated protein 2-like 1 (Baiap2l1). Mechanoreceptors expressing trafficking protein particle complex 3-like and Baiap2l1-marked MNs are subdivided into two subtypes each. These results provide a new system for cataloging somatosensory neurons and their transcriptome databases. RNA-seq of mRNA levels in 197 individual DRG neurons We performed RNA-seq on total 203  individual DRG neurons. Six of them were not qualified and thus, were excluded for further analysis.  To evaluate the quality of RNA-seq, we randomly devided No.72 neurons into two parts and performed RNA-seq seperately.  Thus, we had 204 individual samples from 203 individual DRG and 198 individual qualified samples from 197 individual DRG.

In the present study, we explored transcriptomics and epigenetic differences in the small intestine and colon of prepubescent male and female mice. In addition, the microbiota composition of the colonic luminal content has been examined. At postnatal day 14, male and female C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed and the small intestine, colon and content of luminal colon were isolated. Gene expression of both segments of the intestine was analysed by microarray analysis. DNA methylation of the promoter regions of selected sexually dimorphic genes was examined by pyrosequencing. Composition of the microbiota was explored by deep sequencing. Sexually dimorphic genes were observed in both segments of the intestine of 2-week-old mouse pups, with a stronger effect in the small intestine. Amongst the total of 349 genes displaying a sexually dimorphic effect in the small intestine and/or colon, several candidates exhibited a previously established function in the intestine (i.e. Nts, Nucb2, Alox5ap and Retngamma). In addition, differential expression of genes linked to intestinal bowel disease (i.e. Ccr3, Ccl11 and Tnfr) and colorectal cancer development (i.e. Wt1 and Mmp25) was observed between males and females. Amongst the genes displaying significant sexually dimorphic expression, nine genes were histone-modifying enzymes, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms might be a potential underlying regulatory mechanism. However, our results reveal no significant changes in DNA methylation of analysed CpGs within the selected differentially expressed genes.

Systematic molecular analysis of stem cell behavior is challenging because classic approaches cannot resolve cellular heterogeneity or capture developmental dynamics. Here we provide a comprehensive resource of single-cell transcriptomes of adult hippocampal quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs) and their immediate progeny. We further developed Waterfall, a bioinformatic suite, to statistically quantify singe-cell gene expression along de novo reconstructed continuous developmental trajectory. Our study reveals molecular signatures of qNSCs, characterized by high niche signaling integration and low protein translation capacity. Our analyses further delineate molecular cascades underlying adult qNSC activation and neurogenesis initiation, exemplified by decreased extrinsic signaling capacity, primed translational machinery, and regulatory switches in transcription factors, metabolism, and energy sources. Our study reveals the molecular continuum underlying adult neurogenesis and illustrates how Waterfall can be used for single-cell omics analyses of various continuous biological processes.

Further support for persistent effects is the latent appearance of proneural glioblastomas in adult mice also lacking the tumor suppressor, p53.

The molecular basis of this decline is unknown. Using quantitative PCR for mitochondrial mRNA from multiple tissues from the same animals, we found that the rate of change in mouse mitochondrial expression is tissue-specific, with cardiac expression declining early (8-10 months), adipose expression declining late (25-30 months), and no change in kidney or skin. In cardiac tissue, mitochondria-derived mRNA levels declined more slowly than nuclear encoded mRNAs, suggesting a potential dysregulation. These changes were independent of alteration in mitochondrial number, as measured by quantitative PCR of mitochondrial DNA and citrate synthase activity. We found no change in the variability between mitochondrial mRNA levels with age, suggesting that the changes are not due to random dysregulation at the level of gene expression. Caloric restriction (CR), a lifespan-extending intervention proposed to act through mitochondrial biogenesis, delayed the decline in both cardiac and adipose mitochondrial mRNA levels of F344 rats. CR caused an increase in citrate synthase activity but did not alter mitochondrial DNA content, indicating increased translation or reduced turnover of mitochondrial proteins. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial gene expression changes with age are not coupled to mitochondrial number, are likely to be regulated, and are governed by tissue-specific processes. These findings indicate that aging is neither a programmed organism-wide change orchestrated in a top-down fashion nor a product of random dysregulation of gene expression but that tissue-specific factors may independently control aging in different organ compartments.

Nebulin mutations are the main cause of nemaline myopathy (NEM), with typical NEM adult patients having low expression of nebulin, yet the roles of nebulin in adult muscle remain poorly understood.   To establish nebulin's functional roles in adult muscle we performed studies on a novel conditional nebulin KO (Neb cKO) mouse model in which nebulin deletion was driven by the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promotor.  Neb cKO mice are born with high nebulin levels in their skeletal muscle but within weeks after birth nebulin expression rapidly falls to barely detectable levels  Surprisingly, a large fraction of the mice survives to adulthood with low nebulin levels (<5% of control), contain nemaline rods, and undergo fiber-type switching towards oxidative types.  These microarrays investigate the changes in gene expression when nebulin is deficient.

Acute ER stress induction in the hypothalamus produces glucose metabolism perturbations. However, the neurobiological basis linking hypothalamic ER stress with abnormal glucose metabolism remains unknown. Here we report that genetic and induced models of hypothalamic ER stress are associated with alterations in systemic glucose homeostasis due to increased gluconeogenesis (GNG) independent of body weight changes. Defective alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) production underlies this metabolic phenotype, as pharmacological strategies aimed at rescuing hypothalamic a-MSH content reversed this phenotype at metabolic and molecular level. Collectively, our results posit defective a-MSH processing as a fundamental mediator of enhanced GNG in the context of hypothalamic ER stress, and establish a-MSH deficiency in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons as a potential contributor to the pathophysiology of T2D.

In contrast, we know much less about the function of the highly abundant and extremely diverse class of piRNAs, which partner with MIWI and MILI during meiosis. Both MIWI and its catalytic activity are required for successful spermatogenesis, strongly indicating that piRNA-guided cleavage is critical for germ cell development. To gain an understanding of meiotic piRNA targets, we augmented the mouse piRNA repertoire by introducing an entire human meiotic piRNA cluster. This triggered a spermatogenesis defect, presumably by inappropriately targeting the piRNA machinery to mouse RNAs essential for germ cell development. Through an analysis of such de novo targets, we derived a signature for pachytene piRNA target recognition. This enabled identification of both transposable elements and meiotically expressed protein coding genes as targets of native piRNAs. Cleavage of genic targets begins at the pachytene stage when meiotic piRNAs first appear. As such, target mRNA levels attenuate starting from the pachytene stage and are further repressed throughout meiosis. Target mRNA-piRNA pairs also show evidence of an ongoing cleavage-dependent amplification cycle, which is not normally a strong feature of meiotic piRNAs. Our data support the idea that meiotic piRNA populations must be strongly selected to enable successful spermatogenesis, both driving the response away from essential genes and directing the pathway toward mRNA targets that are regulated by small RNAs in meiotic cells. 48 samples ..

To bypass this problem, we generated a mouse model in which Tfr1 was conditionally deleted in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).  These mice developed severe IEC disruption, characterized by blunted villi, edema, loss of proliferative intervillus IECs, accumulation of lipids, and early neonatal lethality.

We applied a bioinformatics tool for cataract gene discovery iSyTE to identify MafG and its co-regulators in the lens, and generated various null-allelic combinations of MafG:MafK mouse mutants for phenotypic and molecular analysis. By age 4-months, MafG-/-:MafK+/- mutants exhibit lens defects that progressively develop into cataract. High-resolution phenotypic characterization of MafG-/-:MafK+/- lens reveals severe defects in fiber cells, while microarrays-based expression profiling identifies 97 differentially regulated genes (DRGs). Integrative analysis of MafG-/-:MafK+/- lens-DRGs with 1) binding-motifs and genomic targets of small Mafs and their regulatory partners, 2) iSyTE lens-expression data, and 3) interactions between DRGs in the String database, unravels a detailed small Maf regulatory network in the lens, several nodes of which are linked to human cataract. This analysis prioritizes 36 highly promising candidates from the original 97 DRGs. Significantly, 8/36 (22%) DRGs are associated with cataracts in human (GSTO1, MGST1, SC4MOL, UCHL1) or mouse (Aldh3a1, Crygf, Hspb1, Pcbd1), suggesting a multifactorial etiology that includes elevation of oxidative stress. These data identify MafG and MafK as new cataract-associated candidates and define their function in regulating largely non-crystallin genes linked to mouse and human cataract.

This association is especially apparent in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which often develops on the background of chronic hepatitis and hepatic fibrosis, slowly unfolding on a background of chronic inflammation. HCC is one of the most common tumors worldwide, exhibiting a very poor prognosis and high mortality rate with limited available therapeutic tools. The etiology of liver cancer is well known, however there is still a lack of precise knowledge about pathogenesis of HCC. IL-6 have been shown to be of importance for liver protection and prevention of liver injury in animal models of acute sclerosing cholangitis and correlate with increased HCC in human patients. Using a murine model of chronic cholangitis based on the ablation of the Mdr2 gene, this study has examined the role of IL-6  signaling in chronic hepatitis and in the subsequent development of liver cancer.    The main observations of this study are that IL-6 signaling in male Mdr2-KO mice protects from the development of liver injury and fibrosis, but simultaneously promotes tumor initiation.  Thus, IL-6 deficiency in male Mdr2-KO mice dissociates the tight correlation between liver fibrosis and the development of inflammation-associated HCC. To reveal the affected molecular pathways that lead to increased cholestasis and bile acid-induced liver injury, but reduced tumorigenesis in the male IL-6 deficient Mdr2-KO/IL6-KO mice, we performed gene array analysis and identified distinct classes of differentially-expressed genes in these mice. We performed genome-scale gene expression profiling by Affymetrix analysis on tumor-free livers samples from Mdr2-KO, Mdr2-KO/IL6-KO, and wild type C57BL/6 mice at the age of 14 months. .. 14 months;  male;  Mdr2-knockout;  Mdr2-knockout/IL-6-knockout;  wild type;  total RNA;  Mouse liver, IL-6 deficient Mdr2-KO tumor free tissue, 14 months;  Mouse liver, Mdr2-KO tumor free tissue, 14 months;  Mouse liver, wild type control, 14 months;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;

Endogenous protective mechanisms must contribute to the adaptability and plasticity still present in the healthy aged brain. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is one of the few genes with a consistent and evolutionarily conserved up-regulation in the aged brain. ApoD protecting roles upon stress or injury are well known, but a study of the effects of ApoD expression in the normal aging process is still missing. Using an ApoD-knockout mouse we analyze the effects of ApoD on factors contributing to the functional maintenance of the aged brain. We focused our cellular and molecular analyses in cortex and hippocampus at an age representing the onset of senescence where mortality risks are below 25%, avoiding bias towards long-lived animals. Lack of ApoD causes a prematurely aged brain without altering lifespan. Age-dependent hyperkinesia and memory deficits are accompanied by differential molecular effects in cortex and hippocampus. Transcriptome analyses reveal distinct effects of ApoD loss on the molecular age-dependent patterns of cortex and hippocampus, with different cell-type contributions to age-regulated gene expression. Markers of glial reactivity, proteostasis, and oxidative and inflammatory damage reveal early signs of aging and enhanced brain deterioration in the ApoD-knockout brain. The lack of ApoD results in an age-enhanced significant reduction in neuronal calcium-dependent functionality markers and signs of early reduction of neuronal numbers in the cortex, thus impinging upon parameters clearly differentiating neurodegenerative conditions from healthy brain aging. Our data support the hypothesis that the physiological increased brain expression of ApoD represents a homeostatic anti-aging mechanism. The brain cortex and hippocampus of young and aged mice of wild-type and ApoD-KO genotypes were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

To uncover BAT-specific long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), we used RNA-seq to reconstruct de novo transcriptomes of mouse brown, inguinal white, and epididymal white fat and identified ~1500 lncRNAs, including 127 BAT-restricted loci induced during differentiation and often targeted by key regulators PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta. One of them, lnc-BATE1, is required for establishment and maintenance of BAT identity and thermogenic capacity. lnc-BATE1 inhibition impairs concurrent activation of brown fat and repression of white fat genes, and is partially rescued by exogenous lnc-BATE1 with mutated siRNA-targeting sites, demonstrating a function in trans. We show that lnc-BATE1 binds heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U and that both are required for brown adipogenesis. Our work provides an annotated catalog for the study of fat depot-selective lncRNAs, available online, and establishes lnc-BATE1 as a novel regulator of BAT development and physiology.

We recently demonstrated that the microtubule destabilizing protein stathmin is a relevant p27Kip1binding partner involved in the regulation of cell motility.  To get more insights into the in vivo significance of this interaction, we generated p27Kip1 and stathmin double knock out (DKO) mice. Interestingly, thorough characterization of DKO mice demonstrated that most of the phenotypes of p27Kip1 null mice linked to the hyperproliferative behavior, such as the increased body and organ weights, the outgrowth of the retina basal layer and the development of pituitary adenomas, were reverted by co-ablation of stathmin. In vivo analyses showed a reduced proliferation rate in DKO compared to p27kip1 null mice, linked, at molecular level, to decreased kinase activity of CDK4/6, rather than of CDK1 and CDK2. Gene expression profile analyses of mouse thymuses confirmed the phenotypes observed in vivo, demonstrating that DKO clustered with WT and not with p27KO thymuses. Taken together, the results demonstrate that stathmin cooperates with p27Kip1 to control the early phase of G1 to S phase transition and strongly suggest that this function has particular relevance in the contest of tumor progression.

Here, using deep RNA sequencing, we profiled different RNA species in mouse and observed that circRNAs are significantly enriched in neural tissue, relative to other tissues. Using PacBio sequencing, we determined, for the first time, the circular structure of this population of circRNAs as well as their full-length sequences. We discovered that a disproportionate fraction of the brain circRNA population is derived from host genes that code for synaptic proteins. Moreover, based on the separate profiling of the RNAs localized in neuronal cell bodies and neuropil (enriched in axons and dendrites), we found that, on average, circular RNAs are more enriched in the neuropil than their host gene mRNA isoforms. Using high resolution in situ hybridization we, for the first time, directly visualized circRNA punctae in the dendrites of neurons. The host gene origin and location of the circRNA in neurons suggest the possibility that circRNAs might participate in the regulation of synaptic function and plasticity. Consistent with this idea, we observed via profiling at different developmental stages, that the abundance of many circular RNAs changes abruptly at a time corresponding to synaptogenesis. In addition, following a homeostatic downscaling of neuronal activity many circRNAs exhibit significant up or down-regulation. These data indicate that brain circRNAs are positioned to respond to and regulate synaptic function.

However, it remains unknown how the germline epigenome is distinctly established from that of somatic lineages. Here we show that genes commonly expressed in somatic lineages and spermatogenesis-progenitor cells undergo repression in a genome-wide manner in late stages of the male germline and identify underlying mechanisms. SCML2, a germline-specific subunit of a Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), establishes the unique epigenome of the male germline through two distinct antithetical mechanisms. SCML2 works with PRC1 and promotes RNF2-dependent ubiquitination of H2A, thereby marking somatic/progenitor genes on autosomes for repression. Paradoxically, SCML2 also prevents RNF2-dependent ubiquitination of H2A on sex chromosomes during meiosis, thereby enabling unique epigenetic programming of sex chromosomes for male reproduction. Our results reveal divergent mechanisms involving a shared regulator by which the male germline epigenome is distinguished from that of the soma and progenitor cells.

Dicer deletion in mouse oocytes leads to female infertility due to defects during meiosis I. Because miRNA function is suppressed in mouse oocytes, it has been proposed that endo-siRNAs may have a role during female meiosis. By utilizing a catalytically inactive knock-in allele of AGO2 specifically in oocytes, we disrupt the function of siRNAs and analyze the transcriptome of these oocytes in comparison with Ago2 null, and Dicer null oocytes.

We have determined the underlying mechanisms by measuring nascent RNA transcription around the clock in mouse liver.  Unbiased examination of eRNAs that cluster in specific circadian phases identified functional enhancers driven by distinct transcription factors (TFs).  We further identify on a global scale the components of the TF cistromes that function to orchestrate circadian gene expression.  Integrated genomic analyses also revealed novel mechanisms by which a single circadian factor controls opposing transcriptional phases.  These findings shed new light on the diversity and specificity of TF function in the generation of multiple phases of circadian gene transcription in a mammalian organ.

Embryonic piRNAs consist of both primary and secondary species and are mainly directed toward transposons. In meiotic cells, however, the piRNA population is transposon-poor and restricted to primary piRNAs derived from pachytene piRNA clusters. The mechanism controlling which piRNAs are present at each developmental stage is poorly understood. Here we show that RNF17 shapes adult meiotic piRNA content by suppressing the production of secondary piRNAs. In the absence of RNF17, ping-pong (secondary amplification) occurs inappropriately in meiotic cells, aberrantly targeting protein-coding genes and lncRNAs. Our data indicate that RNF17 comprises one component of a "refereeing" mechanism that prevents deleterious activity of the meiotic piRNA pathway by ensuring the selective loading of PIWI proteins with products of meiotic piRNA clusters.

However, little is known, especially in mammals, about the functions of piRNAs beyond retrotransposon suppression1-5. In mammalian spermatocytes, piRNAs are known to be abundantly expressed6-10. Here, we show that a subset of coding and noncoding RNAs in mouse spermatocytes is degraded by the piRNA pathway. By analyzing the germline trasnscriptome of mice deficient in piRNA biogenesis, we identify hundreds of mRNAs as direct targets of piRNAs. Remarkably, the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNAs up-regulated in the piRNA pathway mutants are highly enriched with retrotransposon sequenes, implying that these sequences serve as regulatory elements for piRNA-mediated regulation. Furthermore, deficiencies of piRNAs derived from pseudogenes result in increased mRNA levels of their cognate genes, indicating that pseudogenes regulate their functional cognates via piRNAs. Moreover, we identify a large population of testis-enriched long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), some of which are also degraded by the piRNA pathway. Collectively, our results reveal that the piRNA pathway regulates the expression of both mRNAs and lincRNAs in addition to retrotransposon RNAs during meiosis and the key role of retrotransposons and pseudogenes, two major types of genomic sequences, in this regulation by acting as piRNA sources and/or regulatory elements in target RNAs.

Elucidating and understanding the molecular processes underlying the pathogenesis of autism is critical for effective clinical management and prevention of this disorder.  The goal of this study is to investigate key molecular alterations postulated to play a role in autism and their role in the pathophysiology of autism.  In this study we demonstrate that DNA isolated from the cerebellum of BTBR T+tf/J mice, a relevant mouse model of autism, and from human post-mortem cerebellum of individuals with autism, are both characterized by an increased levels of 8-oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC).  The increase in 8-oxodG and 5mC content was associated with a markedly reduced expression of the 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase 1 (Ogg1) and increased expression of de novo DNA methyltransferases 3a and 3b (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b).  Interestingly, a rise in the level of 5hmC occurred without changes in the expression of ten-eleven translocation expression 1 (Tet1) and Tet2 genes, but significantly correlated with the presence of 8-oxodG in DNA.  This finding and similar elevation in 8-oxodG in cerebellum of individuals with autism and in the BTBR T+tf/J mouse model warrant future large-scale studies to specifically address the role of genetic alterations in OGG1 in pathogenesis of autism.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. Here, we analyze genome-wide profiles of RNA and chromatin organization in the liver of young (3 months) and old (21 months) mice. Transcriptional changes suggest that de-repression of the nuclear receptors PPAR  , PPAR  , and LXR   in aged mouse liver leads to activation of targets regulating lipid synthesis and storage, whereas age-dependent changes in nucleosome occupancy are associated with binding sites for both known regulators (forkhead factors and nuclear receptors) and for novel candidates associated with nuclear lamina (Hdac3 and Srf) implicated to govern metabolic function of aging liver.

To have a systematic understanding on the influence of this gene on the intracelluar environment of intestinal cell, we have conducted a microarray experiment to compare the transcriptomes of the WT and KO mice intestines under the same experimental condition. Gut epithelial cells of WT and KO mice of the same physiological and maintaining condition were isolated and then total RNAs were extracted from them, which could reflect the respective transcription profile of WT and KO mice.

Recent studies have suggested that Tet3-mediated oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and DNA replication-dependent dilution both contribute to global paternal DNA demethylation, but demethylation of the maternal genome occurs via replication. Here we present genome-scale DNA methylation maps for both the paternal and maternal genomes of Tet3-depleted and/or DNA replication-inhibited zygotes. In both genomes, we found that inhibition of DNA replication blocks DNA demethylation independently from Tet3 function, and that Tet3 facilitates DNA demethylation by coupling with DNA replication. For both, our data indicate that replication-dependent dilution is the major contributor to demethylation, but Tet3 plays an important role, particularly at certain loci. Our study therefore both defines the respective functions of Tet3 and DNA replication in paternal DNA demethylation and reveals an unexpected contribution of Tet3 to demethylation of the maternal genome.

In humans, genetic factors greatly influence individual susceptibility to NAFLD. The goals of this study were to compare the magnitude of interindividual differences in the severity of liver injury induced by methyl-donor deficiency among individual inbred strains of mice and to investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with the variability. Feeding mice a choline- and folate-deficient diet for 12 wk caused liver injury similar to NAFLD. The magnitude of liver injury varied among the strains, with the order of sensitivity being A/J ~ C57BL/6J ~ C3H/HeJ < 129S1/SvImJ ~ CAST/EiJ < PWK/PhJ < WSB/EiJ. The interstrain variability in severity of NAFLD liver damage was associated with dysregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, primarily with a down-regulation of the peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPARalpha)-regulated lipid catabolic pathway genes. Markers of oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced DNA damage were also elevated in the livers but were not correlated with severity of liver damage. These findings suggest that the PPARapha-regulated metabolism network is one of the key mechanisms determining interstrain susceptibility and severity of NAFLD in mice.

It also tested the anti-inflammatory potential of curcumin in the colon of these mice with a particular focus on the proteome. A colonic histological injury score was determined for each mouse to assess the level of colon inflammation in Mdr1a-/- mice, and to establish the effect of curcumin on inflammation. Insights into mechanisms of colonic inflammation in the Mdr1a-/- mice were gained using transcriptome (microarray) and proteome (2-D gel electrophoresis and LCMS protein identification) analyses. These data were compared to changes in the colon proteome in response to curcumin, and to previously described transcriptomic analyses [Nones et al, PMID: 18761777; GSE10684] in response to curcumin, in this model. A total of 24 male Mdr1a-/- mice, and 24 male FVB/N mice, purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY, USA) at 4-5 weeks of age, were used for this study. 12 mice were randomly assigned to each of two different dietary groups: control (AIN-76A powdered diet), or curcumin (AIN-76A + 0.2% curcumin). At 21 and 24 weeks of age, mice were euthanized and colon samples taken for histological, microarray, and proteomics analyses. The total histology score (HIS) in the colon was determined according to previously described criteria. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol  reagent. Colon RNA from four Mdr1a-/- mice (with high HIS) on the control diet (i.e. AIN-76A powdered diet) was compared with colon RNA from four FVB/N mice with low HIS also on the control diet (i.e. AIN-76A powdered diet). All individual RNA samples were hybridized against a common reference RNA on separate slides. The reference RNA was prepared using equimolar RNA extracts from small intestine, colon, kidney and liver of normal healthy growing Swiss mice plus RNA extracts from Swiss mouse fetuses. These data were compared with previously reported transcriptomics analysis of colon RNA from the same four Mdr1a-/- mice on the AIN-76A diet (with high HIS) compared with colon RNA from four Mdr1a-/- mice on the curcumin diet (with low HIS; Nones et al 2009, PMID: 18761777) .. 21-24 weeks;  adult and fetal;  high;  low;  control (AIN-76A powdered) diet;  male;  mixed;  Mdr1a-/-;  wild type;  total RNA;  reference RNA;  FVB/N mouse fed control (AIN-76A) diet;  Mdr1a-/- mouse fed control (AIN-76A) diet;  reference RNA;  FVB/N;  Swiss;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Small intestine, colon, kidney, liver (adult); whole fetus;  colon;  Twenty-four male Mdr1a-/- mice, five to six weeks old, mean weight 23.8 g (SD 2.0 g), and twenty-four male FVB/N mice, five to six weeks old, mean weight 24.9 g (SD 2.3 g), were housed individually in cages with pressed wood chips and a plastic tube for environmental enrichment. The room was climate controlled (22 to 24 ?C, at approximately 60 % humidity) with a 12-hour light:dark cycle. All mice were acclimatized for a week before the start of the experiment. Mice were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups of 12 animals each.

In skeletal muscle, both systems' excessive activation induces severe muscle loss. Although altered proteasomal function has been observed in various myopathies, the specific role of proteasomal activity in skeletal muscle has not been determined by loss-of-function approaches. Here, we report that muscle-specific deletion of a crucial proteasomal gene, Rpt3, resulted in profound muscle atrophy and decrease in force. Rpt3 null muscles showed reduced proteasomal activity in early age, accumulation of basophilic structure, disorganization of sarcomere, and formation of vacuoles and concentric membranous structures in electronmicroscope. We also observed accumulation of ubiquitin, p62, LC3, TDP43, FUS and VCP proteins. Proteasomal activity is important to preserve muscle mass and to maintain myofiber integrity. Our results suggest that inhibition/alteration of proteasomal activity can contribute to myofiber degeneration and weakness in muscle disorders, such as inclusion body myositis, characterized by accumulation of abnormal inclusions.

In addition, DUF1220 copy number (dosage) has been implicated in influencing brain size within the human species, both in normal populations and in individuals associated with brain size pathologies (1q21-associated microcephaly and macrocephaly).  More recently, increasing dosage of a subtype of DUF1220 has been linked with increasing severity of the primary symptoms of autism. Despite these intriguing associations, a function for these domains has not been described. As a first step in addressing this question we have developed the first transgenic model of DUF1220 function by removing the single DUF1220 domain (the ancestral form) encoded in the mouse genome. While resulting DUF1220-minus (KO) mice show no obvious anatomical peculiarities, they exhibit a significantly reduced fecundity (x<2>= 19.1, df = 2, p = 7.0 x 10-5). Further extensive phenotypic analyses suggest that DUF1220 KO mice are hyperactive (p < 0.05) relative to wild type litter mates. The linking of DUF1220 loss to a hyperactive phenotype is consistent with separate findings in which DUF1220 over expression results in a down-regulation of mitochondrial function, suggesting a possible role in the prolongation of developmental processes (neoteny) that is most pronounced in the human lineage.

Deletion of NF-kappaB essential modulator in hepatocytes (NemoDeltahepa) causes the spontaneous development of hepatocellular carcinoma preceded by steatohepatitis in mice and thus serves as an excellent model for the progression from chronic hepatitis to liver cancer. In the present study we aimed to dissect the death-receptor mediated pathways that contribute to liver injury in NemoDeltahepa mice. Therefore, we generated NemoDeltahepa/TRAIL-/- and NemoDeltahepa/TNFR1-/- animals and analyzed the progression of liver injury. NemoDeltahepa/TRAIL-/- displayed a similar phenotype to NemoDeltahepa mice characteristic of high apoptosis, infiltration of immune cells, hepatocyte proliferation and steatohepatitis. These pathophysiological features were significantly ameliorated in NemoDeltahepa/TNFR1-/- livers. Hepatocyte apoptosis was increased in NemoDeltahepa and NemoDeltahepa/TRAIL-/- mice while Nemo Deltahepa/TNFR1-/- animals showed reduced cell death concomitant with a strong reduction in pJNK levels. Cell cycle parameters were significantly less activated in NemoDeltahepa/TNFR1-/- livers. Additionally, markers of liver fibrosis and indicators of tumour progression were significantly decreased in these animals.

Using transcriptome profiling in addition to functional assays we demonstrate that loss of Igfbp7 leads to diminished luminal cell differentiation and  expansion of the luminal progenitors.

The study of a novel knock-out mouse model led us to identify the biological roles of the miR-379/miR-410 cluster at the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 region during this metabolic transition. The miR-379/miR-410 cluster is the largest mammalian-specific miRNA cluster composed of 39 pre-miRNA and expressed from the maternally-inherited allele. We unexpectedly found that ~ 35% of heterozygous neonates with a maternal - but not paternal - deletion of the entire 40kb-long miRNA cluster die shortly after birth due to defects in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, as evidenced by impaired hepatic glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. This maladaptive metabolic response is accompanied by profound changes in the neonatal hepatic gene expression program, notably a decrease in the activation of a large set of metabolic genes linked to lipid metabolism. Our study unveils essential roles for the miR-379/miR-410 cluster at the transition from fetal to postnatal life, revealing new layers of RNA-mediated gene regulation at the Dlk1-Dio3 domain that impose parent-of-origin effects on postnatal metabolic functions.

It's unclear how one begets the other. We have shown that loss of b-cell mass can be ascribed to impaired FoxO1 function in different models of diabetes. Here we show that ablation of the three FoxO genes (1, 3a, and 4) in mature b-cells results in early-onset, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)-like diabetes, with signature abnormalities of the MODY networks of Hnf4a, Hnf1a, and Pdx1. Transcriptome and functional analyses reveal that FoxO-deficient b-cells are metabolically inflexible, i.e., they preferentially utilize lipids rather than carbohydrates as source of acetyl-CoA for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This results in impaired ATP generation, and reduced Ca2+-dependent insulin secretion. When viewed in the context of prior data illustrating a role of FoxO1 in b-cell dedifferentiation, the present findings define a seamless FoxO-dependent mechanism linking the twin abnormalities of b-cell function in diabetes. We used microarrays to detail the change of gene expression in pancreatic beta cells after knocking out FoxO1,3 and 4.

We present evidence for temporal cascade regulation of sweat gland development by Wnt, Eda and Shh pathways. The first stage, sweat gland induction, failed completely when Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was blocked in skin epithelium, accompanied by sharp downregulation of Wnt, Eda and Shh pathway genes. In a meta-layer of regulation, Wnt antagonist Dkk4 appeared to operate on sweat gland induction in a negative feedback loop: Dkk4 was itself sharply downregulated in beta-catenin-ablated mice, whereas its over-expression repressed Wnt target genes and significantly reduced gland numbers. Eda signaling succeeded Wnt, and activated downstream Shh pathway. Thus, in absence of Eda, Wnt pathway was still active and initial sweat gland pre-germs were seen but failed to develop germs, and downstream Shh pathway was repressed.  When both Wnt and Eda were intact but Shh was ablated, early stage induction and subsequent duct formation occurred normally, but the final stage formation of secretory coil failed.

This program includes hundreds of growth-promoting genes that are downregulated with age in liver, kidney, lung, and heart, and there is evidence that this component of the program drives the widespread decline in cell proliferation that occurs in juvenile life, as organs approach adult sizes. To investigate epigenetic changes that might orchestrate this program, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-promoter tiling array to assess temporal changes in histone H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation (me3) at promoter regions throughout the genome in kidney and lung, comparing 1- to 4-wk-old mice. We found extensive genome-wide shifts in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 occurring with age in both kidney and lung. The number of genes with concordant changes in the two organs was far greater than expected by chance. Temporal changes in H3K4me3 showed a strong, positive association with changes in gene expression, assessed by microarray, whereas changes in H3K27me3 showed a negative association. Gene ontology analysis indicated that shifts in specific histone methylation marks were associated with specific developmental functions. Of particular interest, genes with decreases in H3K4me3 with age in both organs were strongly implicated in cell cycle and cell proliferation functions. Taken together, the findings suggest that the common core developmental program of gene expression which occurs in multiple organs during juvenile life is associated with a common core developmental program of histone methylation.  In particular, declining H3K4me3 is strongly associated with gene downregulation and occurs in the promoter regions of many growth-regulating genes, suggesting that this change in histone methylation may contribute to the component of the genetic program that drives juvenile body growth deceleration. Tissues samples were collect from Lung (1 and 4 week old) and Kidney (1 and 4 week old) respectively with four biological replications of mice that were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70  C .. total RNA;  Control;  H3K27me3;  H3K4me3;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Kidney;  Lung;  Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free facility, with 4?5 animals  per cage in a temperature-controlled room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and access to food  and water ad libitum.

Yes|GSE49383|Done|WT vs. Mutant|transcription profiling by array|2019-02-11|62|2030|Gene expression data from mouse HDAC4 KO pups, postnatal day 3|Reversible protein acetylation provides a central mechanism for controlling gene expression and cellular signaling events. It is governed by the antagonistic commitment of two enzymes families: the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDAC4, like its class IIa counterparts, is a potent transcriptional repressor through interactions with tissue-specific transcription factors via its N-terminal domain. Whilst the lysine deacetylase activity of the class IIa HDACs is much less potent than that of the class I enzymes, HDAC4 has been reported to influence protein deacetylation through its interaction with HDAC3. To investigate the influence of HDAC4 on protein acetylation, we employed the unbiased AcetylScan proteomic screen. We identified many proteins known to be modified by acetylation, but found that the absence of HDAC4 had no effect on the acetylation profile of the murine neonate brain. This is consistent with the biochemical data suggesting that HDAC4 may not function as a lysine deacetylase, but these in vivo data do not support the previous report showing that the enzymatic activity of HDAC3 might be modified by its interaction with HDAC4. To complement this work, we used Affymetrix arrays to investigate the effect of HDAC4 knock-out on the transcriptional profile of the postnatal murine brain. There was no effect on global transcription, consistent with the absence of a differential histone acetylation profile. Validation of the array data by Taq-man qPCR indicated that only protamine 1 and Igfbp6 mRNA levels were increased by more than one-fold and only CamK4 was decreased. The lack of a major effect on the transcriptional profile is consistent with the cytoplasmic location of HDAC4 in the P3 murine brain. mRNA expression analysis was performed by microarray in 3-day-old HDAC4 KO pups and WT littermates. Ten samples were analysed for each genotype.

We show here that a high fat (HF) diet leads to substantial chromatin remodeling in the livers of C57BL/6J mice, as compared to mice fed a control diet. Regions of the genome that display the greatest variation in chromatin accessibility between HF and control regions are targeted by transcription factors with known roles in the liver including HNF4alpha, CEBPalpha, and FOXA1. Whereas livers of DBA/2J mice fed a HF or control diet also demonstrate diet-induced chromatin remodeling, the regions displaying the greatest variation are largely distinct from those observed in B6 livers, indicating a crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic components in determining how diet-induced chromatin remodeling is associated with metabolic disease progression.

Here, we evaluate the role of the glycogenic scaffolding protein PTG/R5 in energy homeostasis. We demonstrate that feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) increases hepatic glycogen, corresponding to increased PTG levels, increased activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and induced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c). PTG promoter activity was increased by activation of mTORC1 and SREBP1, and PTG and glycogen levels were augmented in mice and cells in which mTORC1 is constitutively active. HFD-dependent increases in hepatic glycogen were prevented by deletion of the PTG gene in mice. Interestingly, PTG knockout mice fed HFD exhibited improved liver steatosis and decreased lipid levels in muscle, in coordination with decreased glycogen, suggesting possible crosstalk between glycogen and lipid stores in the overall control of energy metabolism. Together, these data suggest that transcriptional regulation of PTG by dietary and nutritional cues has profound effects on energy storage and metabolism.

Alignment to individualized genomes increases read mapping accuracy and improves transcript abundance estimates.

The highly specialized cell-cell junction of podocytes, the slit diaphragm, has a central role in the filtration barrier. Dendrin is a poorly characterized cytosolic component of the slit diaphragm in where it interacts with nephrin and Cd2ap. In this study, we have generated a dendrin knockout mouse line and explored the molecular interactions of dendrin. Dendrin-deficient mice were viable, fertile and had normal life span. To reveal the glomerular gene expression changes in the dendrin knockout mouse, Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array were used to profiling the dendrin knockout and control glomeruli. Three dendrin knockout and three littermate control mice at age of 13 months were used to profile glomerular transcriptomes.

Vanin-1 has been described as a putative PPARalpha target gene in liver, but its function in hepatic lipid metabolism is unknown. We investigated the regulation of vanin-1, and total vanin activity, by PPARalpha in mice and humans. Furthermore, the function of vanin-1 in the development of hepatic steatosis in response to starvation was examined in Vnn1 deficient mice, and in rats treated with an inhibitor of vanin activity. Liver microarray analyses reveals that Vnn1 is the most prominently regulated gene after modulation of PPARalpha activity. In addition, activation of mouse PPARalpha regulates hepatic- and plasma vanin activity. In humans, consistent with regulation by PPARalpha, plasma vanin activity increases in all subjects after prolonged fasting, as well as after treatment with the PPARalpha agonist fenofibrate. In mice, absence of vanin-1 exacerbates the fasting-induced increase in hepatic triglyceride levels. Similarly, inhibition of vanin activity in rats induces accumulation of hepatic triglycerides upon fasting. Microarray analysis reveal that the absence of vanin-1 associates with gene sets involved in liver steatosis, and reduces pathways involved in oxidative stress and inflammation. We show that hepatic vanin-1 is under extremely sensitive regulation byPPARalpha and that plasma vanin activity could serve as a readout of changes in PPARalpha activity in human subjects. In addition, our data propose a role for vanin-1 in regulation of hepatic TG levels during fasting.

However, these changes also put females at risk for postpartum depression and psychosis, which impairs parenting abilities and adversely affects children.  Thus, changes in expression and interactions in a core subset of genes may be critical for emergence of a healthy maternal phenotype, but inappropriate changes of the same genes could put women at risk for postpartum disorders.  This study evaluated microarray gene expression changes in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region implicated in both maternal behavior and psychiatric disorders.  Postpartum mice were compared to virgin controls housed with females and isolated for identical durations.  Using the Modular Single-set Enrichment Test (MSET), we found that the genetic landscape of maternal mPFC bears statistical similarity to gene databases associated with schizophrenia (5 of 5 sets) and bipolar disorder (BPD, 3 of 3 sets).  In contrast to previous studies of maternal lateral septum and medial preoptic area, enrichment of autism and depression-linked genes was not significant (2 of 9 sets, 0 of 4 sets).  Among genes linked to multiple disorders were fatty acid binding protein 7 (Fabp7), glutamate metabotropic receptor 3 (Grm3), platelet derived growth factor, beta polypeptide (Pdgfrb), and nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Nr1d1).  RT-qPCR confirmed these gene changes as well as FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt1) and proenkephalin (Penk).  Systems-level methods revealed involvement of developmental gene networks in establishing the maternal phenotype and indirectly suggested a role for numerous microRNAs and transcription factors in mediating expression changes.  Together, this study suggests that a subset of genes involved in shaping the healthy maternal brain may also be dysregulated in mental health disorders and put females at risk for postpartum psychosis with aspects of schizophrenia and BPD.

Using F1 interspecies hybrids, we sequenced RNA from 23 individual midgestation placentas, five late stage placentas, and two yolk sac samples and then used SNPs to determine whether transcripts were preferentially generated from the maternal or paternal allele.  In the placenta, we find 103 genes that show significant and reproducible parent-of-origin bias, of which 78 are novel candidates. Most (96%) show a strong maternal bias which, using multiple models, we demonstrate is not due to maternal decidual contamination.  Analysis of the X chromosome also reveals paternal expression of Xist and several genes that escape inactivation, most significantly Rps4x, Fhl1, and Slc38a5. Finally, sequencing individual placentas allowed us to reveal notable expression similarity between littermates.  In all, we observe a striking preference for maternal transcription in the midgestation mouse placenta and a dynamic imprinting landscape in extraembryonic tissues, reflecting the complex nature of epigenetic pathways in the placenta. 3'-end Sequencing for Expression Quantification (3SEQ) and SNP Analysis to observe parent-of-origin bias in 28 placental samples at two time points and 2 yolk sac samples ..

We confirm previous reports of the graduate appearance of age-related, gland-like structures (ARGLS) in the submucosa, especially in the intercartilage regions and carina. Immunohistochemistry shows these structures contain ciliated and secretory cells and Krt5+ basal cells, but not the myoepithelial cells or ciliated ducts typical of normal submucosal glands. Data suggests they arise de novo by budding from the surface epithelium rather than by delayed growth of small or cryptic submucosal glands. In old mice the surface epithelium contains fewer cells per unit length than in young mice and the proportion of Krt5+, p63+ basal cells is reduced in both males and females. However, there appears to be no significant difference in the ability of basal stem cells isolated from individual young and old mice to form clonal tracheospheres in culture or in the ability of the pithelium to repair after damage by inhaled sulfur dioxide. Gene expression analysis by Affymetrix microarray and quantitative PCR, as well as immunohistochemistry and flow sorting studies, are consistent with low-grade chronic inflammation in the tracheas of old versus young mice. The significance of these changes for ARGL formation are not clear since several treatments that induce acute inflammation in young mice did not result in budding of the surface epithelium. Total RNA from distal tracheas and carinas of four young (2 month) and four older (14 month) C57Bl/6 female mice was extracted using QIAshredder and RNeasy Micro Kits (QIAGEN).

Tcf1-/- mice have previously been characterized and show developmental blocks at the CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) to CD4+CD8+ double positive transition. Due to the blocks in T-cell development, Tcf1-/- mice normally have a very small thymus. Unexpectedly, a large proportion of Tcf1-/- mice spontaneously develop thymic lymphomas with 50% of mice developing a thymic lymphoma/leukemia at the age of 16 wk. These lymphomas are clonal, highly metastatic, and paradoxically show high Wnt signaling when crossed with Wnt reporter mice and have high expression of Wnt target genes Lef1 and Axin2. In wild-type thymocytes, Tcf1 is higher expressed than Lef1, with a predominance of Wnt inhibitory isoforms. Loss of Tcf1 as repressor of Lef1 leads to high Wnt activity and is the initiating event in lymphoma development, which is exacerbated by activating Notch1 mutations. Thus, Notch1 and loss of Tcf1 functionally act as collaborating oncogenic events. Tcf1 deficiency predisposes to the development of thymic lymphomas by ectopic up-regulation of Lef1 due to lack of Tcf1 repressive isoforms and frequently by cooperating activating mutations in Notch1. Tcf1 therefore functions as a T-cell-specific tumor suppressor gene, besides its established role as a Wnt responsive transcription factor. Thus, Tcf1 acts as a molecular switch between proliferative and repressive signals during T-lymphocyte development in the thymus. Using the Tcf1-/- DeltaVII/DeltaVII knockout mouse (Verbeek et al. Nature 1995), thymocytes of 17 mice (5 control Tcf+/-, 4 Tcf-/- and 8 Tcf-/- with thymic lymphoma) were homogenized for RNA isolation using Qiagen RNeasy minicolumns. The quantity and quality of total RNA was determined using spectrophotometry (Nanodrop) and an Agilent Bioanalyzer.

This improper expression was restored by introducing chromosome 1 from the same donor strain as the X chromosome, suggesting that the genetic incompatibility between trans-acting regulatory gene(s) on chromosome 1 and X-linked downstream genes might be a cause of the misregulation.

At least 19 genes are associated with LCA. While most LCA is recessive, mutations in the homeodomain transcription factor gene CRX lead to autosomal dominant LCA. The mechanism of CRX-LCA is not understood. Here, we report a new spontaneous mouse mutant carrying a frameshift mutation in Crx (CrxRip). We show that, unlike Crx-/- mouse retina, the dominant Crx c.763del1 mutation in CrxRip results in congenital blindness with complete loss of ERG, yet the photoreceptors do not degenerate. Dominant CRX frameshift mutations associated with LCA mimic the CrxRip phenotype that can be rescued by Crx. RNA-Seq profiling reveals progressive and complete loss of rod differentiation factor Nrl in CrxRip, while residual Nrl remains in Crx-/- retina. Moreover, Nrl partially restores the rod phenotype in CrxRip/+ mice. We show that the binding of Otx2 to Nrl promoter is obliterated in CrxRip mutant, and ectopic Otx2 can rescue the rod phenotype. Therefore, Otx2 is required to maintain Nrl expression in developing rods to consolidate rod fate. Our studies provide the mechanism of congenital blindness caused by dominant CRX mutations and should assist in therapeutic design. Retinal samples were harvested from WT, CrxRip/+, CrxRip/Rip, Crx-/- and Nrl-/- retina at postnatal days 2 and 21 for whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq).

Using first generation crosses between two distantly related mouse strains, CAST/Ei and C57BL/6, we determined the expression separately from the maternal and paternal alleles.

It has been postulated that such exchange may be communicated to maturing populations of spermatozoa via the transfer of small non-coding RNAs in a mechanism involving epididymosomes; small membrane bound vesicles secreted by the soma of the male reproductive tract (epididymis).  Herein we confirm that mouse epididymosomes encapsulate an impressive repertoire of >350 microRNA (miRNA), a majority (~60%) of which are also represented in the miRNA signature of maturing spermatozoa. This includes >50 miRNAs that were found exclusively in epididymal sperm and epididymosomes, but not in the surrounding soma, thus supporting the notion that epididymosomes may selectively deliver regulatory non-coding RNA cargo to maturing sperm. Interestingly, we also documented substantial plasticity in terms of the epididymosome-borne miRNAs, including significant fold changes in the relative abundance of almost half of the miRNAs along the length of the epididymis.  Finally, we provide the first direct evidence for the transfer of several prominent miRNAs between mouse epididymosomes and spermatozoa, and in so doing afford novel insight into a mechanism of intercellular communication through which the RNA payload of sperm can be modified during their post-testicular development.

AM plays critical roles in blood vessels, including regulation of vascular stability and permeability. To elucidate the autocrine / paracrine function of AM in endothelial cells in vivo. A conditional knockout of AM in endothelial cells (AM EC-KO) was used. The amount of vascularization the matrigel implants was lower in AM EC-KO mice indicating a defective angiogenesis. Moreover, ablation of AM in endothelial cells revealed increased vascular permeability in comparison with wildtype littermates. In addition, AM EC-KO lungs exhibited significantly less tumor growth than littermate WT mice using a syngeneic model of metastasis. Furthermore, following middle cerebral artery permanent occlusion, there was a significant infarct size decrease in animals lacking endothelial AM when compared to their wild type counterparts. AM is an important regulator of EC function, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis and brain response to ischemia. Studies of AM should bring novel approaches to the treatment of vascular diseases.

This A to I editing is widespread and required for normal life and development. Besides mRNAs and repetitive elements, ADARs can target miRNA precursors. Editing of miRNA precursors can affect processing efficiency and alter target specificity. Interestingly, ADARs can also influence miRNA abundance independent of RNA-editing. In mouse embryos where editing levels are low, ADAR2 was found to be the major ADAR protein that affects miRNA abundance. Here we extend our analysis to adult mouse brains where high editing levels are observed. Results: Using Illumina deep sequencing we compare the abundances of mature miRNAs and editing events within them, between wild-type and ADAR2 knockout mice in the adult mouse brain. Reproducible changes in abundance of specific miRNAs are observed in ADAR2 deficient mice. Most of these quantitative changes seem unrelated to A to I editing events. However, many A to G transitions in cDNAs prepared from mature miRNA sequences, reflecting A to I editing events in the RNA, are observed with frequencies reaching up to 80%. About half of these editing events are primarily caused by ADAR2 while a few miRNAs show increased editing in the absence of ADAR2, suggesting preferential editing by ADAR1. Moreover, novel, previously unknown editing events were identified in several miRNAs. In general 64% of all editing events are located within the seed region of mature miRNAs. In one of these cases retargeting of the edited miRNA could be verified in reporter assays. Also, altered processing efficiency upon editing near a processing site could be experimentally verified. Conclusions: ADAR2 can significantly influence the abundance of certain miRNAs in the brain. Only in a few cases changes in miRNA abundance can be explained by miRNA editing. Thus, ADAR2 binding to miRNA precursors, without editing them, may influence their processing and thereby abundance. ADAR1 and ADAR2 have both overlapping and distinct specificities for editing of miRNA editing sites. Over 60% of editing occurs in the seed region possibly changing target specificities for many edited miRNAs.

Although current treatments improve survival rates, patients suffer severe treatment-related side effects and often relapse of tumors carrying resistance mutations, underscoring an urgent need for alternative targeted therapies. Currently, the genetic alterations underlying this disease are not fully understood. Here we identify GNAS, encoding the G-protein Gs-alpha, as a potent tumor suppressor gene in medulloblastoma. GNAS specifically defines a subset of aggressive Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-group medulloblastomas. Gnas loss-of-function in distinct lineage progenitors of the developing hindbrain suffices to initiate medulloblastoma. We find that Gs-alpha is highly enriched at primary cilia of granule neuron precursors and suppresses Shh signaling not only by regulating classic cAMP-dependent pathway but also controlling ciliary trafficking of Smoothened. Concurrent cAMP elevation and Smoothened inhibition robustly arrests tumor cell growth in Gnas mutants. We further reveal oligodendrocyte progenitors as a novel cellular origin for anatomically-distinct Shh-associated medulloblastomas. Together, we identify a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function of Gs-alpha in medulloblastoma partially mediated through inhibiting Shh signaling, and uncover Gs-alpha as a molecular link across disparate cells of origin among Shh-group medulloblastomas, pointing to G- protein modulation as a potential therapeutic avenue. Purpose: To known the gene expression profile of Medulloblastoma which drived by Gnas mutation Methods: mRNAs isolated from the cerebellum of control and Gnas mutants Results:Upregulation of Shh Signaling components in tumors Conclusions: The deletion of Gnas in hGFAP and Olig1 possitive cells result in substantial upregulation of shh signaling and formation of Medulloblastoma cerebellum mRNA profiles of 3 60-day old wild type (Ctrl) and 8 Olig1Cre driven Gsa conditional knockout or 8 hGFAPCre driven conditional knockout mice were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq2000 .. post natal day 60;  Gsa conditional knockout mediated by Olig1Cre;  Gsa conditional knockout mediated by hGFAPCre;  wild type;  total RNA;  cerebellum;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  cerebellum;

High fat diet-fed mice are commonly used to study diabetes progression, but studies are usually limited to a single strain, such as C57Bl/6J. Here, we use a systems biology approach to integrate large phenotypic and islet transcriptomic data sets from six commonly used strains fed a high fat or regular chow diet to identify genes associated with glucose intolerance and insulin secretion. One of these genes is Elovl2, encoding very long chain fatty acid elongase 2. ELOVL2 is responsible for the synthesis of the polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We show that DHA rescues glucose-induced insulin secretion and cytosolic Ca2+ influx impaired by glucolipotoxicity, and that Elovl2 over-expression is able to restore the insulin secretion defect under these conditions. We propose that increased endogenous DHA levels resulting from Elovl2 up-regulation counteracts the insulin secretion defect associated with glucolipotoxicity. Although we focus our experimental validation on Elovl2, the comprehensive data set and integrative network model we used to identify this candidate gene represents an important novel resource to dissect the molecular aetiology of beta cell failure in murine models. 6 mouse strains, 4 time points, 2 diets ..

We analyzed whether the anti-ischemic drug ranolazine could retard the progression of heart failure in an experimental model of heart failure induced by 6 months of chronic pressure overload. The study showed that 2 months of ranolazine treatment improved cardiac function of aortic constricted C57BL/6J (B6)  mice with symptoms of heart failure as assessed by echocardiography. The microarray gene expression study of heart tissue from failing hearts relative to ranolazine-treated and healthy control hearts identified heart failure-specific genes that were normalized during treatment with the anti-ischemic drug ranolazine.

The quest to personalize cancer medicine based on targeting these underlying genetic abnormalities presupposes that sustained inactivation of tumor suppressors and activation of oncogenes are required for tumor maintenance. Mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway are a hallmark of cancer and significant efforts toward pharmaceutical reactivation of mutant p53 pathways are underway1-3. Here we show that restoration of p53 in established murine lung tumors leads to significant but incomplete tumor cell loss specifically in malignant adenocarcinomas but not in adenomas. Also, we define amplification of MAPK signaling as a critical determinant of malignant progression. The differential response to p53 restoration depends on activation of the Arf tumor suppressor downstream of hyperactive MAPK signaling. We propose that p53 naturally limits malignant progression by responding to increased oncogenic signaling, but is unresponsive to low levels of oncogene activity that are sufficient for early stages of lung tumor development. These data suggest that restoration of pathways important in tumor progression, as opposed to initiation, may lead to incomplete tumor regression due to the stage-heterogeneity of tumor cell populations. 3 cell lines each treated with Tamoxifen or EtOH vehicle.

Although primordial germ cells (PGCs) have been generated and isolated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro, concurrent expression of several cell surface receptors and transcription factors, at various levels, confounds the identification of these cells. To date, only a few genes that mark the onset of germ cell commitment to the epiblast, including tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), Blimp1, Stella, and Fragilis, have been used with some degree of success to detect PGC formation in in-vitro model systems. In light of the current literature, the generation of an unlimited supply of germ cells and gametes from pluripotent stem cells would greatly facilitate studies into reproductive development. To accomplish this, we would need to discover novel markers that are specifically expressed in germ cells. Here we identified four genes that are specifically expressed in male and female germ cells, both in vivo and in vitro, but are not expressed in somatic tissues or ESCs. Expression of these genes therefore allows us to distinguish committed germ cells from undifferentiated pluripotent cell populations, a prerequisite for the successful derivation of germ cells and gametes in vitro. For RNA isolation, PGCs were sorted by FACS, collected by centrifugation, lysed in RLT buffer (QIAGEN), and processed using RNeasy Micro kits with on-column DNase digestion as per the manufacturer's instructions. Integrity of RNA samples was quality-checked using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). If possible, 300 ng of total RNA per sample was used as starting material for linear amplification (Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification kit, Ambion), which involved synthesis of T7-linked double-stranded cDNA and 14 hrs of in-vitro transcription incorporating biotin-labeled nucleotides. Purified and labeled cRNA was then quality-checked on a 2100 Bioanalyser, and hybridized as biological or technical duplicates for 18 hrs onto MouseRef-8 v2 gene expression BeadChips (Illumina), following the manufacturer's instructions.

T. denticola ATCC 35404 was injected into the subcutaneous soft tissue over the calvaria of BALB/c mice for 3 days, after which the soft tissues and calvarial bones were excised.  RNA was isolated from infected soft tissues and calvarial bones and analyzed for transcript profiles using Murine GeneChip   MG-MOE430A Affymetrix arrays to provide a molecular profile of the events that occur following infection of these tissues. We used mouse microarrays to detail the molecular profile of the events that occur following infection of calvarial and bone tissues and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes during this process.

This report makes these data publicly available in raw and processed forms, as a resource to the community.  Importantly, we previously made biospecimens from this same mouse model freely available through a sample repository, so researchers can obtain samples to test biological hypotheses without the need of breeding animals and collecting biospecimens. Experimental design:  Twelve datasets are available, encompassing 841 LC-MS/MS experiments (plasma and tissues) and 255 microarray analyses of multiple tissues (thymus, spleen, liver, blood cells, and breast).  Cases and controls were rigorously paired to avoid bias. Results:  In total, 18,880 unique peptides were identified (PeptideProphet peptide error rate    1%), with 3884 and 1659 non-redundant protein groups identified in plasma and tissue datasets, respectively.  Sixty-one of these protein groups overlapped between cancer plasma and cancer tissue.   Conclusions and clinical relevance:  These data are of use for advancing our understanding of cancer biology, for software and quality control tool development, investigations of analytical variation in MS/MS data, and selection of proteotypic peptides for MRM-MS.  The availability of these datasets will contribute positively to clinical proteomics. Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays were used to profile whole tissues from 5 different tissue types of 25 tumor-bearing and 25 control mice of the Her2/Neu breast cancer mouse model.

Our studies reveal that ShcA signaling during early breast cancer progression is required to establish and maintain an immunosuppressive state that favors tumor growth. Consistent with these transgenic studies, high ShcA levels correlate with poor outcome and reduced CTL infiltration in primary human breast cancers. Conversely, elevated expression of a ShcA-regulated immune signature, generated from ShcA-null mammary tumors, is a predictor of good prognosis in HER2-positive and basal breast cancer patients.

We have implemented intravital microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging of the mouse spleen in experimental infections with the Plasmodium yoelii non-lethal (17X) and lethal (17XL) strains. Notably, there was higher parasite accumulation, reduced motility, lost of directionality and different T2 relaxation times only in spleens of mice infected with the 17X strain. Moreover, these differences were associated with the formation of a strain-specific induced spleen tissue barrier, with macrophage-clearance escape, and with cytoadherence of infected reticulocytes to this barrier. This is a novel spleen-immune evasion mechanism in which parasite-induced spleen remodeling and adherence to this organ allow establishment of chronic infections. We performed time-series global transcriptional analyses from spleens of mice infected with the P. yoelii 17X and 17XL strains at days 3, 4, 5, 10% and 50% of parasitemia  post-infection, together with  non-infected spleens as a reference day 0, using commercially available arrays representing the complete mouse genome (Agilent Whole Mouse Genome G4122A). .. 6-8 weeks;  female;  total RNA;  spleen, 10% parasitemia, lethal 17XL strain;  spleen, 10% parasitemia, non-lethal 17X strain;  spleen, 50% parasitemia, lethal 17XL strain;  spleen, 50% parasitemia, non-lethal 17X strain;  spleen, control 1, 0h;  spleen, control 2, 0h;  spleen, day 3 post-infection, lethal 17XL strain;  spleen, day 3 post-infection, non-lethal 17X strain;  spleen, day 4 post-infection, lethal 17XL strain;  spleen, day 4 post-infection, non-lethal 17X strain;  spleen, day 5 post-infection, lethal 17XL strain;  spleen, day 5 post-infection, non-lethal 17X strain;  BALB/c;  10090;  Mus musculus;  spleen;

TLR4 is the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dsRNA viral mimic poly(I:C) binds to TLR3, and bacterial CpG DNA signals through TLR9.  TLR4 signaling is mediated by adaptor molecules Myd88 and TRIF while TLR3 pathway involves only the TRIF adaptor and TLR9 signals solely through Myd88.      Methods:  To identify genes other than those in TLR pathways that mediate macrophage response to different PAMPs, RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS, poly(I:C), or CpG DNA, and RNA was profiled on microarrays 6 hrs and 24 hrs post-treatment.  Gene expression data were analyzed to determine genes, pathways and transcriptional networks that are in common and unique to each of the three TLR stimuli.  Potentially novel candidates revealed by this analysis were tested for their role in innate immunity using RNA interference.    Results:  Many genes are differentially regulated by LPS and poly(I:C) at both 6 hrs and 24 hrs following treatment, while CpG DNA elicits a much less pronounced transcriptional response.  By analyzing gene expression data for networks and pathways, we prioritized differentially expressed genes that are in common to all three PAMPs as well as those shared by LPS and poly(I:C).  Knockdown by RNA interference of two genes, Plec1 and TPST1, inhibited production of IL-6 in response to LPS in cultured macrophages.      Conclusions:  We have identified novel innate immunity genes that may be important in macrophage response to LPS, poly(I:C), and CpG DNA stimuli.  Our results provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that should be further investigated in mice and human populations.

It was recently discovered that this Shh does not signal on the tumor cells, but rather the stromal cells that in turn produce an unknown set of reciprocal signals that act as growth- or survival cues for the tumor cells. This sequencing effort aims to identify the reciprocal signals. Mouse fibroblasts and Shh-expressing human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were either grown alone, or in a non-adherent coculture system.

However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constitutent cell types. Here we propose a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Hundreds of single-cell RNA-Seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data was projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves   all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy is demonstrated by analyzing the complete transcriptomes of 436 single cells of three distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology and disease.

Treg-mediated suppression induces iTR35 generation in an IL35- and IL10-dependent manner in vitro, and in inflammatory conditions in vivo in Trichuris-infected intestines and within the tumor microenvironment, where they appear to contribute to the regulatory milieu.  iTR35 may constitute a key mediator of infectious tolerance and may contribute to Treg-mediated tumor progression, and ex vivo-generated iTR35 may possess therapeutic utility.

We have previously shown that bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMC) transplantation improves inflammation, fibrosis and ventricular diameter in hearts of mice with chronic Chagas    disease. Here we investigated alterations of gene expression in the hearts of chronic chagasic mice submitted or not to BMC therapy. C57Bl/6 mice chronically infected with T. cruzi (6 months) were transplanted with BMC or saline i.v. and sacrificed 2 months later. RNA was extracted from the hearts of normal controls, chagasic and BMC transplanted mice and microarray analysis was performed using MO30k oligonucleotide arrays.  Out of the 9390 unigenes quantified in all samples, 1702 had their expression altered in chronic chagasic hearts compared to those of normal mice. Major categories of significantly upregulated genes were related to inflammation, fibrosis and immune responses, while genes involved in mitochondrion function were downregulated. When BMC-treated chagasic hearts were compared to infected mice, 1631 (96%) of the alterations detected in infected hearts were not found, although an additional 109 genes were altered by treatment, indicating a remarkable 84% transcriptomic recovery. Immunofluorescence and morphometric analyses confirmed the effects of BMC therapy in the pattern of inflammatory-immune response and expression of adhesion molecules. Our results demonstrate important immunomodulatory effects of BMC therapy in chagasic cardiomyopathy and indicate potentially relevant factors involved in the pathogenesis of the disease that may provide new therapeutic targets.  We compared RNA samples extracted from whole hearts of 4 control, 4 chagasic and 4 BMC-treated chagasic mice by analyzing hybridization to microarrays printed by Duke University (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gove/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL8938) spotted with MO30k mouse Operon version 3.0 70-mer oligonucleotides. The hybridization protocol (see Soares et al, 2010), the slide type and the scanner settings were uniform throughout the entire experiment to minimize the technical noise. Briefly, 20 ug total RNA extracted in Trizol from each of the twelve samples (individual hearts) was reverse transcribed in the presence of fluorescent Alexa Fluor   555- and Alexa Fluor  647-aha-dUTPs (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to obtain labeled cDNA. Red and green labeled samples of biological replicas were then co-hybridized (   multiple yellow    strategy, 22) overnight at 50   C. After washing (0.1% SDS and 1% SSC) to remove the non-hybridized cDNA, each array was scanned at 630V (635 nm) and 580V (532 nm) with GenePix 4100B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and images were primarily analyzed with GenePixPro 6.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Microarray data were processed as described previously (Soares et al, 2010).  A gene was considered as significantly up- or down-regulated when comparing four hearts from one condition to those from another if the absolute fold change was >1.5x and the p-vlaue of the Sutdent   s heteroscedastic t-test of equality of the means of the distributions with a Bonferroni-type adjustment for each redundancy group (set of spots probing the same gene) was <0.05. .. chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy;  T. cruzi;  control;  total RNA;  BMC transplanted chagasic heart;  Chagasic heart;  Control heart;  C57Bl/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  heart;  bone marrow cell transplantation;  Age-matched non-infected C57Bl/6 mice were sacrificed and hearts removed and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for five minutes.;  C57Bl/6 mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection with Colombian Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes obtained from culture supernatants of infected LCC-MK2 cells.

Moreover, it is unclear how the path of ES cell differentiation relates to the molecular decisions made by tissues undergoing normal development. The motivation behind this work is to increase our understanding of this relationship and its potential limitations.

Using a novel murine appendicitis model we earlier demonstrated that AA proffered significant protection against subsequent experimental colitis. AIM: To delineate genes and biological pathways involved in the protective effect of AA against subsequent colitis using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of DNA microarray data. METHODS:  Appendicitis and appendicectomy was done (5 week old male BALB/c mice) near the most proximal colon (caecal lymphoid follicles) and colonic samples were harvested from the most distal colon. Two consecutive laparotomies were done in control Sham-Sham (SS) mice. RNA was extracted (TRIzol  ) from 4 individual colonic samples per group (AA group vs. SS group) with each sample taken independently through Affymetrix   microarray hybridization. For GSEA, data for more than 23,000 genes were exported from Partek and analyzed with GSEA software (with 2852 gene sets encoded) to establish correlates with phenotypes of the gene sets. RESULTS: Distal colonic expression of 636 gene-sets were significantly upregulated in AA group samples (False Discovery Rates (FDR) values < 1 % and p value < 0.001; stringent statistical selection). These were validated by quantitative PCR of 14 selected genes across the immunological spectrum and over time-intervals of 3 days, 14 days and 28 days. CONCLUSIONS:  Many key immunological, apoptosis-related and cellular function-associated gene-sets involved in the protective effect of AA in experimental colitis were identified. Further analysis of these profiles and biological pathways will assist utilizing these gene products and manipulating various aspects of these pathways to develop better therapeutic strategies in the management of intractable IBD.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which ABA elicits its immune modulatory effects are not well understood. This project used a systems approach in combination with functional and in vivo studies to investigate the target gene pathways modulated by ABA in the context of an inflammatory LPS challenge. RESULTS: Dietary ABA-supplementation regulates the expression of gene pathways associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR g), cAMP signaling and lipid metabolism in PPAR g-expressing mice. However, the pattern of differentially expressed genes is significantly reduced in the spleens of tissue-specific PPAR g null mice fed ABA. These differences in gene expression coincided with enhanced PPAR g-reporter activity of macrophages treated with ABA and enhanced intracellular cAMP accumulation in ABA-treated splenocytes. Splenocytes from wild-type (WT) and Null (epithelial and immune cell-specific PPARg knock-out) mice were sampled with or without ABA supplementation and with or without LPS stimulation. ..

It is formed by a monolayer of epithelial cells located within the brain ventricles and in addition to be responsible for the formation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is ideally positioned to transmit signals into and out of the brain. Specifically, here, we evaluated the overall kinetic response of the mouse CP to peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is the Gram-negative bacteria cell wall. This study shows that as soon as 1h after the injection, the CP responds by altering the expression of several genes. This response reaches a maximum at 3h and returns to the basal profile for most of the transcripts at 72h. To do this analysis we compared the CP transcriptome of LPS injected animals with the CP transcriptome of saline injected animals and using this we also dissect the CP basal transcriptome. From this analysis we confirm that the genes most highly expressed were those implicated in energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis) and in ribosomal function, which is in agreement with the secretory nature of the CP. Finally, we also describe genes not previously identified as being expressed in the basal CP. Gene expression study in choroid plexus.

In this study, to clarify the characteristics of these fractionated cells in detail, gene expression analysis were performed using the GeneChip Mouse Genome Array 430 2.0 (Affymetrix).

Trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10c12 CLA) reduces triglyceride levels in adipocytes. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was recently demonstrated to be involved in the emerging pathways regulating this response. This study investigated the role of AMPK and inflammation in lowering triglyceride levels by testing the following hypotheses: 1) A moderate activator of AMPK, such as metformin, and an inflammatory response are sufficient to reduce triglycerides, and 2) Strong activation of AMPK is also sufficient. These experiments were performed by adding compounds that affect these pathways and measuring their effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Tumor necrosis factor    (TNF-  ), an inflammatory cytokine, increased the ability of metformin to reduce triglycerides, but TNF-   was observed to activate AMPK. A comparison of metformin, phenformin, TNF-  , and t10c12 CLA found a correlation between AMPK activity level and triglyceride reduction. Inhibitors of the prostaglandin (PG) biosynthetic pathway interfered with t10c12 CLA's ability to reduce triglycerides. Inhibitors of MAPK/ERK kinase or Jun N-terminal kinase interfered with the phosphorylation of phospholipase A2 and triglyceride reductions.

These RNAs are evolutionarily conserved in mammalian genomes and thus presumably function in diverse biological processes. Here, we report the identification of lincRNAs that are regulated by p53. One of these lincRNAs (lincRNA-p21) serves as a repressor in p53-dependent transcriptional responses.  Inhibition of lincRNA-p21 affects the expression of hundreds of gene targets enriched for genes normally repressed by p53. The observed transcriptional repression by lincRNA-p21 is mediated through the physical association with hnRNP-K. This interaction is required for proper genomic localization of hnRNP-K at repressed genes and regulation of p53 mediated apoptosis. We propose a model whereby transcription factors activate lincRNAs that serve as key repressors by physically associating with repressive complexes and modulating their localization to sets of previously active genes.

Transient hyperglycaemia altered expression of 769 arterial genes, of which 200 did not reverse following  recovery from hyperglycaemia. Many such genes are known to promote atherogenesis, including several implicated in arterial calcification and inflammation. This supports the view that hyperglycaemia causes not only very early deleterious changes in arterial gene expression but that to a large extent these persist for some time after restoration of normal blood glucose levels in vivo. Together, results support the contention that avoiding excess CVD risk in diabetes requires very early correction of hyperglycaemia.

However, the cell intrinsic consequences of mTORC1 activation remain poorly defined. Here, we identify global trancriptional changes in TSC1 and TSC2 null MEFs, which exhibit constitutive activation of mTORC1, compared to wild-type littermate control lines.  A rapamycin time course is included to determine those changes that are dependent on mTORC1 signaling, revealing mTORC1 induced and repressed transcripts. In order to identify mTORC1-dependent transcriptional changes, we compared wild-type MEFs to both Tsc1-/- and Tsc2-/- MEFs following serum starvation, where mTORC1 signaling is off in wild-type cells and fully active in TSC-deficient cells.  All cell lines were serum-starved for 24 h, and the Tsc1-/- and Tsc2-/- cells were treated with a time course of rapamycin prior to the isolation of mRNA for microarray analysis. Immortalized wild-type (Tsc2+/+ p53-/-), Tsc1-/- (p53+/+, 3T3-immortalized), and Tsc2-/- (p53-/-, derived from a littermate of the wild-type cell line) MEFs are the three cell lines used in this study and were derived in the laboratory of David J.

To completely explore the potential of the MHV-68 system for the investigation of gHV miRNAs, it would be desirable to know the number and expression patterns of all miRNAs encoded by MHV-68. By using small RNA deep sequencing, we systematically investigated the MHV-68 miRNA expression profiles in both lytically and persistently infected cells. In addition to the known nine MHV-68 miRNAs, we identified six novel MHV-68 miRNA genes and analyzed the expression levels of all MHV-68 miRNAs. Furthermore, we also characterized the cellular miRNA expression signatures in MHV-68 infected versus non-infected NIH3T3 fibroblasts and in TPA-treated versus non-treated S11 cells. We found that mmu-mir-15b and mmu-mir-16 are highly upregulated upon MHV-68 infection of NIH3T3 cells, indicating a potential role of cellular miRNAs during MHV-68 infection. Our data will aid to fully explore the functions of gHV miRNAs.

Skin gamma delta T cells recognize epithelial damage and release cytokines and growth factors that facilitate wound repair.  To determine the impact of obesity and metabolic disease on skin gamma delta T cells, we isolated skin gamma delta T cells from 10-week old C57BLKS/J lean db/+ and obese db/db animals for further study.  Due to a deficiency in the leptin receptor (db), homozygous db/db animals do not process satiety signals, continually eat and develop severe obesity and metabolic disease.  Skin gamma delta T cells isolated from these animals were compared for changes in mRNA expression using microarray.  We have determined that obesity and metabolic disease negatively impacts homeostasis and functionality of skin gamma delta T cells, rendering host defense mechanisms vulnerable to injury and infection. The goal of this experiment was to compare skin gamma delta T cells in a control mouse to skin gamma delta T cells isolated from an obese mouse to see what homeostatic changes occur in obesity and metabolic disease.  gamma delta T cells were isolated from two 10-week old lean db/+ control and two 10-week old obese db/db animals for comparison.

Methodology/Principal Findings: To assess potential mechanisms of UAG action in vivo, we examined rapid effects of UAG on genome-wide expression patterns in fat, muscle and liver of growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-ablated mice using microarrays. Expression data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Regulation of subsets of these genes was verified by quantitative PCR in an independent experiment. UAG acutely regulated clusters of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in all three tissues, consistent with enhancement of insulin sensitivity. Conclusions/Significance: Fat, muscle and liver are central to the control of lipid and glucose homeostasis. UAG rapidly modulates the expression of metabolically important genes in these tissues in GHSR-deleted mice indicating a direct, GHSR-independent, action of UAG to improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic profile.

Recently, the peripheral effects of inhibiting the CB1 receptor has been appreciated through studies in diet-induced obese and liver-specific CB1 KO mice. In this report, we systematically investigated gene expression changes in peripheral tissues of DIO mice treated with the CB1 inverse agonist AM251. CB1 receptor inhibition led to down-regulation of genes within the de novo fatty acid and cholesterol synthetic pathways, including SREBP-1 and -2, and their downstream targets in both liver and adipose tissue. In addition, genes involved in fatty acid Beta-oxidation were up-regulated with AM251 treatment, probably through the activation of PPARalpha. In adipose tissue, CB1 receptor inhibition led to the down-regulation of genes in the TNFalpha signal transduction pathway and possibly to the activation of PPARgamma, both of which would result in improved insulin sensitivity. CB1-/- mice were obtained from A. Zimmer (University of Bonn) (Zimmer et al., 1999) and back-crossed onto C57BL/6J genetic background for ten generations by A. Zimmer before homozygous CB1-/- mice were re-derived at Taconic Farms (German Town, NY) onto the C57BL/6N genetic background.  Male CB1-/- mice and control littermates (n=5-7 in each group) at 2 months of age were fed with regular chow (Teklad 7012, 13 % kcal from fat, 3.41 kcal/g, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or high fat diet (S3282, 59.4% kcal from fat; 24.5% kcal from carbohydrate; 16.2% kcal from protein; 5.29 kcal/g, Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ, USA) for 14 weeks, and were individually caged 1 week before drug treatment.

To further understand the role of Notch signaling during endothelial differentiation, this study uses both an in vivo gain-of-function and an in vivo loss-of-function approach.  At embryonic day 9.5, embryos with activated Notch1 signaling in the endothelia display a variety of growth and cardiovascular defects, and die soon after E10.5.  Most notably, the extra-embryonic vasculature of the yolk sac displays remodeling differentiation defects.  In the wild-type yolk sac, the primary vascular network has begun to reorganize, forming the large primary vessels and the smaller capillaries.  In the activated Notch1 embryos, remodeling is defective; the vasculature have an enlarged surface with decreased inter-vessel space.  Embryos with ablated Notch signaling also display growth and vascular defects at E9.5 similar to the activated Notch1 embryos, however they exhibit a lack of vascular remodeling in the yolk sac, retaining the simple vascular plexus seen at E8.5.  These results indicate that Notch signaling plays a critical role in the remodeling of the vasculature in the early embryo, particularly in the extra-embryonic region. A conditional transgenic system was used in this study to activate Notch signaling. The ubiquitous ROSA26Notch transgene with a Neo/stop cassette flanked by loxP sites, followed by the N1-ICD cDNA, was recombined with a Tie2-CRE mouse, resulting in the removal of the STOP cassette and the subsequent activation of the Notch1 intracellular domain.  This allowed for the overexpression and expansion of Notch signaling in all endothelial cells.  Male Tie2-Cre mice were mated with female ROSA26Notch mice and the resulting embryos were dissected at embryonic day 9.5.  To ablate Notch signaling, Tie2-Cre mice were used in a two-generation cross to obtain Tie2-Cre; Rbpj flox/flox embryos.  These embryos lack RBPJ binding activity in the endothelia.  In both instances, embryos were used for genotyping and the yolk sac were separated and used to isolate total RNA with an RNeasy mini kit. The RNA was analyzed with the Mouse Genome 430A Array from Affymetrix.  Samples were performed in duplicate, and RNA from wild type yolk sac tissues was compared to activated Notch and RBPJ loss-of-function yolk sac tissues. .. embryonic day 9.5;  Tie2 0/0; ROSA +/+;  Tie2 Tg/0; ROSA +/N1ICD;  Tie2-Cre; Rbpj flox/flox;  total RNA;  Mouse yolk sac tissues at E9.5, Notch1 activated;  Mouse yolk sac tissues at E9.5, RBPJ loss-of-function;  Mouse yolk sac tissues at E9.5, wild type;  C57BL6;  mixed;  10090;  Mus musculus;  yolk sac;  Embryos were dissected from the decidual tissue at E9.5.

We used deep-sequencing to characterize the microRNome from most developing lymphocytes, various hematopoietic cell lineages, and representative mouse tissues. Epigenetic and transcriptome profiles were also compiled from selected T and B cell stages by ChIP-Seq and mRNA-Seq respectively. We show that lymphocyte-specific miRNAs are either tightly regulated during development by polycomb group-mediated H3K27me3, or maintained in a semi-activated state prior to full expression. Because of extensive miRNA biogenesis, the cellular concentration of mature miRNAs does not typically reflect transcriptional changes. However, we here uncovered a subset of miRNAs for which abundance is directly regulated by miRNA gene expression.

Deregulation of Shh target genes often results in unrestrained GNP proliferation and eventually medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain malignancy.  Gene expression profiling was coupled with transcription factor binding location analysis to determine the Gli1-controlled transcriptional regulatory networks in GNPs and medulloblastoma cells.  We detected significant overlap, as well as differences, in the Gli1-controlled transcriptional regulatory networks in GNPs and MBs. We determined the presence of gene expression in each dataset.  There were 9260 genes expressed in Gli1-FLAG GNPs and 9185 genes expressed in Gli1-FLAG;Ptc+/- tumors; 8691 of which are in common.  The large overlap is consistent with the cellular origin of these tumors.  When the genes detectably expressed were intersected with our binding data, there were only 132 putative Gli1 target genes shared by both cell populations.  Due to the heightened activation of the Hh pathway in tumors relative to GNPs, we further deduced direct Gli1 target genes exclusive to tumors by determining significantly induced genes in tumors versus in Ptc+/- GNPs.  We identified at least 116 tumor-specific Gli1 target genes.  These data suggest that tumor formation is accompanied by a tremendous change in the battery of Gli target genes. Presence of gene expression was determined for all samples: Gli1-FLAG-expressing GNPs, Ptc+/- GNPs, and Gli1-FLAG;Ptc+/-medulloblastomas.

We are increasingly aware that changes in mRNA splicing are associated with various characteristics of cancer. The most deadly aspect of cancer is metastasis, the process by which cancer spreads from the primary tumor to distant organs. However, little is known specifically about the involvement of alternative splicing in the formation of macroscopic metastases. Our study investigates transcript isoform changes that characterize tumors of different abilities to form growing metastases.  METHODS AND FINDINGS: To identify alternative splicing events (ASEs) that are associated with the fully metastatic phenotype in breast cancer, we used Affymetrix Exon Microarrays to profile mRNA isoform variations genome-wide in weakly metastatic (168FARN and 4T07) and highly metastatic (4T1) mammary carcinomas. Statistical analysis identified significant expression changes in 7606 out of 155,994 (4%) exons and in 1725 out of 189,460 (1%) intronic regions, which affect 2623 out of 16,654 (16%) genes. These changes correspond to putative alternative isoforms-several of which are novel-that are differentially expressed between tumors of varying metastatic phenotypes. Gene pathway analysis showed that 1224 of genes expressing alternative isoforms were involved in cell growth, cell interactions, cell proliferation, cell migration and cell death and have been previously linked to cancers and genetic disorders. We chose ten predicted splice variants for RT-PCR validation, eight of which were successfully confirmed (MED24, MFI2, SRRT, CD44, CLK1 and HNRNPH1). These include three novel intron retentions in CD44, a gene in which isoform variations have been previously associated with the metastasis of several cancers.  CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that various genes are differently spliced and/or expressed in association with the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells. Identification of metastasis-specific isoforms may contribute to the development of improved breast cancer stage identification and targeted therapies. We used RNA tumor tissues derived from three murine mammary carcinoma cell lines (168FARN, 4T07 and 4T1); four biological replicates of 168FARN, four biological replicates of 4T07, and four biological replicates of 4T1 were hybridized independently at McGill university site. .. 168FARN;  4T07;  4T1;  total RNA;  168FARN;  4T07;  4T1;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Four mice were injected (1?10^-5 cells) with 168FARN, five mice with 4T07 and four mice with 4T01.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these observations, including targeting of transcription factors to accessible chromatin marked by lysine 4-monomethylated histone H3 (H3K4me1) and interactions between transcription factors that enable nucleosome displacement. Here we demonstrate that collaborative interactions of PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell-lineage-determining transcription factors establish common and cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions in macrophages and B cells, respectively. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These sites are representative of locations that serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. In concert with analysis of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs. ChIP-Seq and gene expression profiling was performed in macrophages, B cells, and a variety of genetically modified primary cells and cell lines approximating developmental stages of macrophage and B cell development. ..

(GUDMAP Series ID: 40)|The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. HoxB7-GFP transgenic mice were utilized to isolate the ureteric duct cells from E10.5 embryonic  kidneys.  The ureteric duct cells were isolated from embryos using microdissection, trypsin treatment and FACS.   The RNA was isolated from purified ureteric duct cells and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays. .. 10.5 dpc;  Tg(Hoxb7-EGFP)33Cos / MGI:3715437;  total RNA;  unknown;  ureteric trunk;  CD-1;  10090;  Mus musculus;  TS18;  pool size: 1 Ureteric ductPooled sample: NoDissection Method: Microdissection, trypsinization & fluorescent activated cell sortingHoxb7-GFP transgenic mice are time-mated.

Here, we found that Akt activation in embryonic stem (ES) cells generated self-renewing spheres during mesodermal differentiation induction and that the differentiation status of the sphere cells was in between ES cells and PGCs.  Essential regulators for PGC specification and their downstream germ cell-specific genes were expressed in the spheres, showing that the cells of the sphere commenced the differentiation to germ lineage.  However, the spheres could not proceed to spermatogenesis after transplantation to testes.  Meanwhile, the transfer of the spheres to the original feeder-free ES cell culture conditions induced chaotic differentiation.  In contrast, when the spheres were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts or in the presence of ERK-cascade and GSK3 inhibitors, the reversion to the ES cell-like cell states was induced.  These results indicate that the Akt signaling brings about a novel metastable and pluripotent state between ES cells and PGCs. Five samples were analyzed, which included the Akt-Mer-expressing ES cell (ESC) line #21 treated with or without 4OHT (4-hydroxytamoxifen), the #21 ESC-derived primordial germ cell (PGC)-like sphere cells and the ESC-like cells reverted from #21 PGC-like sphere cells.

The combination of genome-wide transcriptional profiling of degenerating hippocampal tissue with microscopy analyses reveals that the sustained inhibition of CREB function in A-CREB mice is associated with dark neuron degeneration, whereas its strong chronic activation in VP16-CREB mice primarily causes excitotoxic cell death and inflammation. Furthermore, the meta-analysis with gene expression profiles available in public databases identifies relevant common markers to other neurodegenerative processes and highlights the importance of the immune response in neurodegeneration. Overall, these analyses define the ultrastructural and transcriptional signatures associated with these two forms of hippocampal neurodegeneration, confirm the importance of fine-tuned regulation of CREBdependent gene expression for CA1 neuron survival and function, and provide novel insight into the function of CREB in the etiology of neurodegenerative processes. For each mouse genome 430 2.0 gene expression array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), total RNA was extracted from the hippocampi of three to four mice with the same age, sex, and genotype to produce one pooled sample. We analyzed three late A-CREB pooled samples (6-week-old mice) and three late VP16-CREB pooled samples (3-week-off dox) with their corresponding control littermate samples (three pooled samples for each strain). To compare with early changes, we included two pooled A-CREB early samples (3-week-old mice) and two pooled VP16-CREB early samples (1-week-off dox) with their corresponding control littermate samples.

We identified ~12,000 neuronal activity-regulated enhancers that are bound by the general transcriptional co-activator CBP in an activity-dependent manner. A function of CBP at enhancers may be to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as we also observed activity-regulated RNAPII binding to thousands of enhancers. Remarkably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 that is mono-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me1). The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of mRNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis. These findings reveal that a widespread mechanism of enhancer activation involves RNAPII binding and eRNA synthesis.

Caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the mutant huntingtin protein (mhtt), HD pathogenesis impairs function in the cerebral cortex and in medium spiny neurons of the striatum  and involves transcriptional dysregulation of a number of genes. Of these genes, silencing of  genes related to mitochondrial function is believed to explain metabolic dysfunction in rodent  models of HD. Here we show that transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which is upregulated in HD,  exacerbates transcriptional dysregulation by acting as a selective corepressor of nuclear genes.  TG2 inhibition by RNA knockdown, genetic deletion, or administration of a novel irreversible,  peptide-based TG2 inhibitor (ZDON) de-repressed two established regulators of mitochondrial  function, PGC-1   and cytochrome c in a cell model of HD. TG2 must localize to non-coding or  coding regions of these mitochondrial metabolic genes to silence their transcription. As expected,  TG2 inhibition reversed the increased susceptibility of HD mouse cells and human HD  myoblasts to the mitochondrial toxin, 3-nitroproprionic acid (3-NP); however, protection  mediated by TG2 inhibition was not associated with improved mitochondrial bioenergetics.  Indeed, an unbiased array analysis indicated that TG2 inhibition leads to normalization of not  only mitochondrial genes but of nearly 40% of genes that are dysregulated in HD mouse striatal  neurons, including chaperone and histone genes. Indeed, TG2 interacts directly with Histone 3 in  the nucleus. Moreover, TG2 inhibition significantly attenuated photoreceptor degeneration in a  Drosophila model of HD and protected mouse HD striatal neurons (YAC128) from NMDA-  induced toxicity. Altogether these findings demonstrate that TG2 mediates its deleterious effects  in HD by contributing to broad transcriptional dysregulation of genes representing many cellular  functions. These studies define a novel HDAC-independent epigenetic strategy for treating  neurodegeneration.

We were interested in the physiologically relevant roles, and pathways regulated by RORalpha1 action in skeletal muscle. This major mass organ accounts for ~40% of the total body mass, and significant levels of lipid catabolism, glucose disposal and energy expenditure. We utilized the strategy of targeted muscle specific expression of a truncated (dominant negative) RORalpha   DE in transgenic mice, to investigate RORalpha1 signalling (and function) in this peripheral tissue. Expression profiling and pathway analysis indicated that RORalpha regulated genes involved in: (i) lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, cardiovascular and metabolic disease; and (ii) the LXR nuclear receptor signaling pathway and, (iii) the Akt and AMPK signaling cascades. This analysis was extensively validated by rigorous qPCR analysis using TaqMan Low Density Arrays, coupled to rigorous statistical analysis (with Empirical Bayes, and Benjamini-Hochberg). Moreover, westerns and metabolic profiling were utilized to validate the genes, proteins and pathways (lipogenic, Akt, AMPK and fatty acid oxidation) involved in the regulation of metabolism by RORalph1. The identified genes and pathways were in concordance with the demonstration of hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, attenuated insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, and impaired glucose uptake in the transgenic heterozygous Tg-RORalpha   DE animals. In conclusion, we propose that RORalpha1 is involved in regulating the Akt2-AMPK signalling pathways in the context of lipid homeostasis in skeletal muscle. Total RNA was compared from quadriceps femoris of both transgenic and wild type mice. Transgenic mice contained a truncated version of human RORalpha1 (RORalpha1delDE) where the entire E region and part of the hinge/D region have been removed.

Recently, STEAP4 was implicated in promoting insulin sensitivity by acting in white adipose tissue (WAT) to control the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Indeed, the loss of STEAP4 expression in mice leads to increased production of inflammatory cytokines in visceral WAT and systemic insulin resistance. In this report, we demonstrate that in mouse liver STEAP4 is produced at significant levels and that STEAP4 transcription is induced by IL-6. We further demonstrate that the STEAP4 gene is a direct target of phosphorylated STAT3 in mouse liver. In addition, hepatic STEAP4 expression is regulated by feeding and fasting, and obesity leads to the induction of STEAP4 expression in the liver. Interestingly, the regulation of STEAP4 in both feeding and fasting and the obese state appears to require the transcription factor C/EBPalpha that may act in concert with STAT3 as they both bind to the proximal STEAP4 promoter in vivo. Taken together these data suggest the transcriptional regulation of hepatic STEAP4 may play a critical role in the response to nutritional and inflammatory stress and contribute to the protective effect of STEAP4 in vivo.  10-week old male C57BL6 mice were fasted for 16 h overnight and then given either saline or IL-6 (100 ng/mouse) injections intraperitoneally for 1 h.

Genome-wide profiling studies have revealed the enrichment of histone H3K27 methyltransferase PRC2 on Wnt genes. However, the functional significance of such a direct link between the two types of developmental regulators in mammalian cells, and the role of PRC2 in adipogenesis, remain unclear. Here we show PRC2 and its H3K27 methyltransferase activity are required for adipogenesis. PRC2 directly represses Wnt1, 6, 10a and 10b genes in preadipocytes and during adipogenesis. Deletion of the enzymatic Ezh2 subunit of PRC2 eliminates H3K27me3 on Wnt promoters and de-represses Wnt expression, which leads to activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling and inhibition of adipogenesis. Ectopic expression of the wild type Ezh2, but not the enzymatically inactive F667I mutant, prevents the loss of H3K27me3 and the defects in adipogenesis in Ezh2-/- preadipocytes. The adipogenesis defects in Ezh2-/- cells can be rescued by expression of adipogenic transcription factors PPARa, C/EBPb, or inhibitors of Wnt/b-catenin signaling. Interestingly, Ezh2-/- cells show marked increase of H3K27 acetylation globally as well as on Wnt promoters. These results indicate that H3K27 methyltransferase PRC2 directly represses Wnt genes to facilitate adipogenesis, and suggest that acetylation and trimethylation on H3K27 play opposing roles in regulating Wnt expression. To identify additional PRC2-regulated genes in preadipocytes, we performed microarray analysis in Ezh2flox/flox preadipocytes infected with retroviruses expressing Cre or vector alone. .. brown preadipocyte;  Ezh2 +/+;  Ezh2 -/-;  total RNA;  immortalized mouse brown preadipocyte;  10090;  Mus musculus;

To unravel molecular mechanisms of these CoQ10 effects, a genome-wide transcript profiling in liver, heart, brain and kidney of SAMP1 mice supplemented with the reduced (QH2) or oxidized form of CoQ10 (Q10) was performed. Liver seems to be the main target tissue of CoQ10 intervention, followed by kidney, heart and brain. Stringent evaluation of the resulting data revealed that QH2 has a stronger impact on gene expression than Q10, which was primarily due to differences in the bioavailability. Indeed, we found that QH2 supplementation was more effective than Q10 to increase levels of CoQ10 in the liver of SAMP1 mice (54.92-fold and 30.36-fold, respectively). To identify functional and regulatory connections of the    top 50    (p < 0.05) up- and down-regulated QH2-sensitive transcripts in liver (fold changes ranging from 21.24 to -6.12), text mining analysis (Genomatix BiblioSphere, GFG level B3) was used. Hereby, we identified 11 QH2-sensitive genes which are regulated by PPAR-   and are primarily involved in cholesterol synthesis (e.g. HMGCS1, HMGCL, HMGCR), fat assimilation (FABP5), lipoprotein metabolism (PLTP) and inflammation (STAT-1). Thus, we provide evidence that QH2 is involved in the reduction of fat and cholesterol synthesis via modulation of the PPAR-   signalling pathway. These data may explain, at least in part, the observed effects on decelerated age-dependent degeneration processes in QH2-supplemented SAMP1 mice. Whole genome expression profiles were analysed from liver, heart, brain and kidney (each analyzed separately) of SAMP1 mice supplemented with QH2, Q10 or a control diet.

In mammals, the Trithorax family includes KMT2A-D (MLL1-4), a family of SET domain proteins that function in large complexes to impart mono-, di-, and trimethylation at H3K4.  Individual KMT2s and their co-factors are essential for embryonic development and the establishment of correct gene expression patterns, presumably by demarcating the active and accessible regions of the genome in a cell specific and heritable manner.  Despite the importance of H3K4me marks in development, little is known about the importance of histone methylation in maintaining gene expression patterns in fully differentiated and non-dividing cell types. In this report, we utilized an inducible cardiac-specific Cre driver to delete the PTIP protein, a key component of a H3K4me complex, and ask whether this activity is still required to maintain the phenotype of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes.  Our results demonstrate that reducing the H3K4me3 marks is sufficient to alter gene expression patterns and significantly augment systolic heart function.  These results clearly show that maintenance of H3K4me3 marks is necessary for the stability of the transcriptional program in differentiated cells. The array we performed allowed us to identify genes that are regulated by PTIP and histone methylation. 8-week-old littermate mice on a mixed C57B6 and B6129 background were utilized. Three mice were on a background with a PTIP floxed allele and a wild type PTIP allele (PTIP+1, PTIP+2, PTIP+3). Three mice had a transgene that expresses a modified estrogen receptor -Cre recombinase fusion protein under the control of a cardiac-specific driver (alpha myosin heavy chain, Jackson Lab stock #005650) and a floxed PTIP allele and a null PTIP (PTIPKO1, PTIPKO2, PTIPKO3). Both groups of mice were injected with tamoxifen at 8 weeks of age. Tamoxifen deletes the floxed PTIP allele in the PTIPKO mice. 5 days after tamoxifen injection, RNA was harvested from left ventricle (LV) apices in both groups.

We have analyzed the survival and tumor spectrum in a population of Pten    hypermorphic    mice (Ptenhy/+), which express approximately 80% of total Pten protein. Notably, the Ptenhy/+ developed a spectrum of tumors of variable latencies, with breast tumors occurring at the highest penetrance. Surprisingly, all breast tumors analyzed retain two intact copies of Pten, and maintain Pten protein levels above that observed in heterozygosity. Importantly, subtle down-regulation of Pten was found to alter the expression profile of genes involved in cell proliferation. Taken together, our findings support the notion that initiation of tumorigenesis can occur in the absence of genetic hits, thereby questioning the uniqueness of a saltatory model for cancer susceptibility. In order to understand whether subtle variations in Pten level may affect pathways involved in tumorigenesis, we analyzed the genome-wide expression profile of Ptenhy/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In the Ptenhy/+ mouse model, mice are born with approximately 80% of total Pten protein and are viable and normally fertile. To decrease the expression level of Pten below homozygosity, we targeted intron 3 of Pten with a neomycin (Neo) cassette, under the control of the strong CMV promoter, thereby taking advantage of transcriptional interference. Next, we intercrossed Pten hy/+ mice with Pten+/- mice to generate cohorts of hypomorphic littermate mice with decreasing levels of Pten expression as follows: Ptenwt > Ptenhy/+ > Pten+/- >Ptenhy/- mice littermates. To preserve a constant 129/C57BL/6 mixed genetic background, we have crossed Pten hy/+ mice with Pten +/- for more than seven generations prior to analysis.

Recently we have been able to demonstrate that a single donor treatment with the synthetic metalloporphyrin cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPPIX) for heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) induction results in the reduction of donor-derived DCs following IRI thus leading to the preservation of graft long-term function. Gene expression analysis in murine liver revealed the up-regulation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) after CoPPIX treatment. Since it has been shown that CoPPIX is able to inhibit DC maturation, we could demonstrate that DC (-LPS) induced maturation guided by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alloreactive T cell proliferation is dependent of STAT3 phosphorylation and independent of HO-1 activity. These observations highlight the immunomodulatory capacity of STAT3 which might be of further interest for the inhibition of immune response.

To gain an insight into the regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in aberrant energy metabolic status and pathogenesis of NAFLD, we analyzed the expression of miRNAs in livers of ob/ob mice, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetic mice and normal C57BL/6 mice by miRNA microarray. Compared to normal C57BL/6 mice, ob/ob mice showed up-regulation of 8 miRNAs and down-regulation of 4 miRNAs in fatty livers. Up-regulation of miR-34a and down-regulation of miR-122 was found in livers of STZ-induced diabetic mice. These results demonstrate that distinct miRNAs are strongly dysregulated in NAFLD and hyperglycemia. Comparison between miRNA expressions in livers of ob/ob mice and STZ-administered mice further revealed up-regulation of 4 miRNAs and down-regulation of 2 miRNAs in livers of ob/ob mice, indicating that these miRNAs may represent a molecular signature of NAFLD. A distinctive miRNA expression pattern was identified in ob/ob mouse liver and hierarchical clustering of this pattern could clearly discriminate ob/ob mice from either normal C57BL/6 mice or STZ-administered mice.

To mimic total RNA degradation in snap-frozen livers and duodenums from mice (wild type female, C57/Bl6) tissues were stored in a -80  C freezer and then transferred to dry ice. Each frozen tissue was sliced into five identical pieces which then were transferred into eppendorf tubes. At time point zero (T0), all samples were placed on ice and total RNA was extracted immediately from (T0) and at later time points [30 min (T30), 60 min (T60), 120 min (T120) and 240 min (T240)]. RNA integrities were assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 which calculates RIN values of assayed RNAs. We found that at T0, the RNA integrity for both liver and duodenum was above 7, indicating good quality total RNA. However, 30 min on ice was sufficient to reduce RNA integrity, indicated by the decrease in RINs. These findings indicate that RNA degradation can take place in defrosted tissue at low temperature (i.e. on ice). For comparison, we assessed the extent to which RNA integrity is preserved in freshly harvested tissues when tissue processing is delayed. Liver and duodenum samples were collected from mice and either processed immediately or maintained on ice, as described above. Bioanalyzer electropherograms of the liver samples did not indicate any significant total RNA degradation even when samples remained on ice for up to 4 hrs. By contrast, duodenal samples (which are rich in RNases) do show high susceptibility to degradation similar to the snap-frozen defrosted material. These findings suggest that tissues such as duodenum or pancreas should either be processed immediately or snap-frozen and processed individually.To assess to which extent total RNA degradation affects miRNA expression profiles, we hybridized to the miCHIP microarray total RNAs extracted from freshly harvested livers and duodenums liver and from snap frozen livers and duodenums. Hierarchical clustering (HCL), by Pearson correlation, was used to cluster samples based on their miRNA expression profiles. Our analysis shows that miRNAs extracted from freshly harvested liver is less degraded (matrix plot analyses). Consistent with high level of RNases present in duodenum, miRNAs from freshly harvested duodenum are extensively degraded. Based on these data, we conclude that samples with low RIN values (less than 7) do not merit analysis on miRNA arrays. .. total RNA;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice,  T240 minutes;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T0 replica A;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T0 replica B;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T120 minutes;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T30 minutes;  Duodenum from C57Bl/6 mice, T60 minutes;  Livers from C57Bl/6 mice,  T30 minutes;  Livers from C57Bl/6 mice, T0 replica A;  Livers from C57Bl/6 mice, T0 replica B;  Livers from C57Bl/6 mice, T120 minutes;  Livers from C57Bl/6 mice, T240 minutes;  Livers from C57Bl/6 mice, T60 minutes;  C57/Bl6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  duodenum;  liver;  Wild type female mice of the C57BL/6J genetic background were used for this experiment.

To characterize their relative transcriptomes and identify a genomic basis for their relevance to human prostate cancers, we compared mouse prostate tumors expression profiles to those from a panel of human prostate cancer isolates and to normal and benign prostates. Human prostate cancers and mouse prostate tumor models both exhibit the activation of genes associated with growth, cell cycle control, and inhibition of differentiation (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CEBPB, CEBPG, CSF1, CTSS, DMBT1, EGFR, PLCG2, PXN, SPP1, TNFSF9), and conversely, diminished expression of genes associated with normal prostate differentiation and function. All tumors also exhibit dysregulated expression of genes associated with inflammation, the disruption of prostate-associated ER stress pathways, as well as with oxidative stress, energy metabolism, cell adhesion, and stress response. Immunoinflammatory and altered cell adhesion process-associated genes exhibited prominent expression in early stage tumors. In contrast, metastatic human prostate cancer samples eliminated the expression of most immunoinflammatory-associated transcripts. Cross-species comparisons of molecular programs that are shared or distinguishing of Nkx3.1; Pten mutant mouse models and human adenocarcinomas clearly delineate core tumorigenesis programs associated with cell cycle activation and loss of differentiation. Compared to locally spreading mouse and human tumors, metastatic prostate cancer exhibits greatly reduced expression of immunoinflammatory and adhesion genes, implying that immuno-inflammatory activation may enable first stages of tumorogenesis, but suppress metastasis. These results provide a novel framework to identify stage-specific biomarkers and candidate targets for combinatorial therapeutics. The complex role of inflammation suggests a need for additional caution in countering metastasis.  Keywords: tumor stage 26 Affymetrix MOE430A microarrays ..

To identify Rhox5-regulated genes, we generated 15P-1 Sertoli cell clones expressing physiological levels of Rhox5 from a stably transfected expression vector.  Microarray analysis identified many genes altered in expression in response to Rhox5, including those encoding proteins controlling cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, metabolism, and cell-cell interactions.  Fifteen of these Rhox5-regulated genes were chosen for further analysis.  Analysis of Rhox5-null male mice indicated that at least 9 of these are Rhox5-regulated in the testes in vivo.  Many of them have distinct postnatal expression patterns and are regulated by Rhox5 at different postnatal time points.  Most of them are expressed in Sertoli cells, indicating that they are candidates to be directly regulated by Rhox5.  Transfection analysis with expression vectors encoding different mouse and human Rhox family members revealed that the regulatory response of a subset of these Rhox5-regulated genes is both conserved and redundant.  Given that Rhox5 depends on AR for expression in Sertoli cells, we examined whether some Rhox5-regulated genes are also regulated by androgen receptor (AR).  We provide several lines of evidence that this is the case, leading us to propose that RHOX5 serves as a key intermediate transcription factor that directs some of the actions of AR in the testes. Four 15P-1 Sertoli cell clones stably transfected with mouse Rhox5-expression vector were used for microarray analysis. Among them, two clones (6 and 24) expressed highest level of Rhox5 mRNA, and other two clones (14 and 16) expressed the lowest level of Rhox5 mRNA. .. 15P-1;  male;  total RNA;  high Rhox5 mRNA;  low Rhox5 mRNA;  15P-1 Sertoli cell line;  10090;  Mus musculus;  To generate stable Rhox5 expression plasmid transfected clones, 15P-1 cells cultured to ~60% confluency in 100 mm plates were transfected with 2 mg of Rhox5 expression plasmid using lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and clones resistant to antibiotic (700 mg/ml G418) were selected.;

We investigated the transcriptional regulation of the AID gene, Aicda, in the class switch   inducible CH12F3-2 cells, and found that the Aicda regulation involves derepression by several layers of positive regulatory elements in addition to the 5    promoter region. The 5    upstream region contains functional motifs for the response to signaling by cytokines, CD40-ligand, or stimuli that activate NF-  B. The first intron contains functional binding elements for the ubiquitous silencers c-Myb and E2f and for B cell   specific activator Pax5 and E-box-binding proteins. To confirm involvement of these transcription factors in Acida regulation, we examined their expression profile of these factors in na  ve and germinal center  B cells. Na  ve B cells were defined as B220+PNA-Fas- and germinal center B cells were defined as B220+PNA+Fas+ cells.

The process by which the commensal microbiota influence the host immune system is poorly understood. We show here that colonization of the small intestine of mice with a single commensal microbe, segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB), is sufficient to induce the appearance of CD4+ T helper cells that produce IL-17 and IL-22 (Th17 cells) in the lamina propria. SFB adhere tightly to the surface of epithelial cells in the terminal ileum of mice with Th17 cells but are absent from mice that have few Th17 cells. Colonization with SFB was correlated with increased expression of genes associated with inflammation, anti-microbial defenses, and tissue repair, and resulted in enhanced resistance to the intestinal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Control of Th17 cell differentiation by SFB may thus establish a balance between optimal host defense preparedness and potentially damaging T cell responses.  Manipulation of this commensal-regulated pathway may provide new opportunities for enhancing mucosal immunity and treating autoimmune disease. We compared the gene expression profiles in the terminal ileum of Swiss-Webster GF mice before and after colonization with SFB, which induced robust Th17 cell differentiation. To sieve out host effects, the role of other microbiota, as well as other factors, we also evaluated the transcriptional program induced in Jackson C57BL/6 mice after co-housing with Taconic B6 animals, which also induces Th17 cell differentiation. 0.5 cm of the most distal part of the small intestine was dissected.

Here, we describe an autosomal recessive inherited anemia in the mouse mutant hem6. Hematologic and transplantation analyses revealed a mild, congenital, hypochromic, microcytic anemia intrinsic to the hematopoietic system that is associated with a decreased red blood cell zinc protoporphyrin to heme ratio, indicative of porphyrin insufficiency. Iron uptake experiments showed that hem6 reticulocytes are defective in heme production, but not cellular iron uptake defects. Male hem6 mice are infertile due to defects in sperm structure and motility. Through positional cloning and BAC complementation, we identified the gene responsible for the hem6 anemia. We hypothesized that the relative deficiency in erythroid-specific mRNAs in hem6 reticulocytes might be due to decreased mRNA stability. Indeed, serial microarray analysis of reticulocytes aged in vitro showed that numerous, abundantly expressed erythroid-specific transcripts decayed at faster rates in hem6 reticulocytes compared to control reticulocytes. Furthermore, these mRNAs also have progressively shorter poly (A) tails, suggesting a mechanism for the increased rate of decay.

Expression profiling reveals Cdx2 as the most potent inducer of transcriptome perturbation in ES cells, followed by Esx1, Sox9, Tcf3, Klf4, and Gata3. Immunoprecipitation (IP) with a FLAG-antibody in Cdx2-induced ES cells, identifies NuRD in CDX2-associated protein complexes; and chromatin-IP-sequencing identifies CDX2-binding sites predominantly in genes up-regulated by CDX2. Compendium analyses of Cdx2- and the other TF-inducible ES cells suggest a central role of the POU5F1/SOX2/NANOG protein complex in a swift-acting control mechanism to down-regulate a common set of genes at the beginning of multi-lineage ES cell differentiations.

The mutant protein forms intracellular aggregates in the brain. However, the cellular mechanisms causing toxicity are still poorly understood and there are currently no effective treatments. In this study we show that administration of a rapamycin ester, CCI-779, improves motor performance in a transgenic mouse model of SCA3. CCI-779 inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and hence upregulates protein degradation by autophagy. CCI-779 reduces the number of aggregates seen in the brains of transgenic mice and decreases levels of cytosolic soluble mutant ataxin-3, while endogenous wild-type protein levels remain unaffected. CCI-779 is designed for long-term use in patients and therefore represents a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SCA3. Using this disease model and treatment paradigm we employed a microarray approach to investigate transcriptional changes that might be important in the pathogenesis of SCA3. This approach identified Usp15, which showed expression changes at both the mRNA and protein level. Usp15 levels were also changed in mice expressing another mutant polyglutamine protein, huntingtin. In total we identified 16 transcripts that were decreased in transgenic ataxin-3 mice that were normalised following CCI-779 treatment, as the number of transcripts changed was low and the magnitude of these changes was small we suggest that transcriptional dysregulation may not be an important step in the primary pathogenesis of SCA3.

While bone morphogenic proteins maintain pluripotency of undifferentiated mouse ES cells, the role of Activin/Nodal signaling is less clear.  To determine the target genes of Activin/Nodal-Smad2 signaling in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells, changes in gene expression were examined following stimulation with recombinant Activin (2 hours) or after inhibition of Activin/Nodal with SB431542 (24 hours) using defined media culture conditions with LIF and 20 ng/mL BMP4.  SB431542 is a specific inhibitor of ALK4/5/7 receptors and antagonizes both Activin and Nodal signaling. Via western analysis, Activin stimulation increased pSmad2 in ES cells after 2 hours, and treatment with SB431542 for 24 hours virtually eliminated pSmad2.  Total Smad2 expression remained unchanged through these manipulations.  RNA from cells treated with Activin or SB431542 was extracted by standard methods with Qiagen RNeasy columns.

At time-points day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, spleen tissue was harvested and splenocytes isolated. Total RNA was isolated for mRNA expression analysis. The mouse genome 430 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Inc.), which consists of over 39,000 genes in a single array, was used.  Based on gene expression patterns, the variable genes were grouped into sixteen clusters. Each cluster contained genes associated with cellular immune processes, signaling, cell-cycle, complement coagulation cascade, biosynthesis/metabolism, ubiquitous genes involved in several cascades, and genes of unknown function.  Interestingly, gene expression in clusters 2 and 3 were significantly downregulated by day 1 following EBOV challenge in CD45100% mice.  In contrast, at day 1 following EBOV infection, the CD45 62% mice maintained gene expression patterns similar to day 0.  The differences in gene expression patterns between the CD45 100% and CD45 62% splenocytes were less apparent at day 3 following infection and by days 5 and 7 they became very similar.  At day 9, when wild-type mice had succumbed to the disease, the pattern in CD45 62% mice remained similar to the day 7 patterns of CD45 100% and CD45 62% mice.  The pattern at days 11 and 13 in the CD45 62% mice had returned to that of day 0 CD45 100% or CD45 62% mice.  These results suggested that in CD45 100% mice, subversion of the cell transcriptional machinery during the early stages of EBOV infection (day 1) might represent a major factor leading to death of the mice.  In CD45 62% mice, early control of gene regulation likely provided the appropriate antiviral responses leading to regulated inflammation, immune co-stimulation, and survival.   RNA expression in CD45 100% and 62% mice were compared at each time point: days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7, using an empirical Bayes procedure. From 3 to 8 biological replicates were in each group.

From the list of Dlx3 modulated genes we focused our attention on the study of two candidates, Lifr and Chrdl1.  Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated the recruitment of Dlx3 transcription factor to the promoters of Lifr and Chrdl1, and luciferase assays confirmed the role of Dlx3 in the regulation of Lifr expression.  Over-expression of Dlx3 in mouse embryonic stem cells stimulated Lifr and Chrdl1 expression and inhibited expression of Id proteins and Bmp4.  We show that Dlx3 increases the expression of both soluble and transmembrane forms of Lifr.  Soluble Lifr may regulate extracellular Lif levels via solution binding, while transmembrane Lifr mediates the signal transduction pathway. The data suggests that Dlx3 may be involved in stem cell differentiation in a dosage dependent way through its interaction with Lifr and with Chrdl1, a known antagonist of Bmp4.  We speculate that Dlx3 may also be involved in osteoblast differentiation through interactions involving Lifr, Bmp, and Id proteins and signaling via the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways.  In summary, our data suggests that Dlx3 proteins play a significant role in a highly tuned network in early embryogenesis.

This model is based largely on in vivo invertebrate or in vitro mammal studies.  Here we examine the dynamic behaviour of adult hair follicle stem cells in their normal setting by employing mice with repressible H2B-GFP expression to track cell divisions and Cre inducible mice to perform long-term single cell lineage tracing. We provide direct evidence for the infrequent stem cell division model in intact tissue.  Moreover, we find that differentiation of progenitor cells occurs at different times and tissue locations than self-renewal of stem cells.  Distinct fates of differentiation or self-renewal are assigned to individual cells in a temporal-spatial manner. We propose that large clusters of tissue stem cells behave as populations, whose maintenance involves unidirectional daughter-cell fate decisions. We used microarrays to expression profile the stem cell progeny generated at distinct differentiation and self-renewal stages. We employed double transgenic mice, K5tTA x pTRE-H2B-GFP in which an epithelial Keratin 5 (K5) promoter drove repressible histone H2B-GFP expression. Repression is achieved by feeding the mice doxycycline for a period of time (chase), when the H2B-GFP dilutes in cells by 2-fold at division. This allowed us to quantify precise proliferation history in vivo, from the amount of H2B-GFP fluorescence retained in cells after chase. After various chase periods we sacrificed mice at different ages corresponding to distinct phases of hair cycle. We isolated skin cell suspensions from these mice and stained them for surface expression of stem cell niche bulge(Bu) markers CD34 and alpha 6-integrin.  Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) revealed histograms with distinct peaks of 2-fold median H2B-GFP intensity corresponding to distinct divisions. For microarray, we FACS sorted bulge(Bu) and non-bulge(NonBu) cells based cell surface marker staining and their proliferation history with H2B-GFP intensity, after two doxycycline chase schemes (Postnatal Day 18-PD21 or PD22-PD25), then extract total RNA from each cell fractions.

Gene profiling studies of hearts from infected mice have revealed prominent changes in gene expression within many functional pathways.  This variety of transcriptomic changes in infected mice raises the question of whether gene expression alterations in whole hearts are due to changes in infected cardiac myocytes or other cells or even to systemic effects of the infection on the heart. We employed microarrays to examine infected cardiac myocyte cultures 48 hr post-infection. Statistical comparison of gene expression levels of 2,258 well annotated unigenes in four independent cultures of infected and uninfected myocytes detected (p < 0.05) significant > 1.5 absolute fold changes in 221 (8.8%) of the sampled genes.  Major categories of affected genes included those involved in immune response, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion.  While changes in extracellular matrix and cell adhesion genes were anticipated, modulation of immune response genes in the infected myocytes was surprising.  These findings on infected cardiac myocytes in culture reveal that altered gene expression described in the heart in Chagas disease are the consequence of both direct infection of the myocytes and resulting from presence of other cell types in the myocardium and systemic effects of infection.   Transcriptomic alteration in neonatal mouse cultured cardiomyocytes induced by the parasite T.cruzi were detected by profiling and compared using AECOM mouse 32k oligonucleotide arrays hybridized in the "multiple yellow" strategy described in Iacobas et al,  Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2006 349(1):329-38. .. developmental stage neonatal;  cardiomyocyte;  T. cruzi;  control;  total RNA;  chagasic_cardiomyocytes;  control_cardiomyocytes;  C57Bl/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Neonatal mice were killed by decapitation, and the hearts were isolated and placed in 60 mm plastic culture dishes containing sterile ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; GIBCO-BRL, Grand Island, NY).

The homogenate was then transferred to a 25 ml Ehrlenmeyer flask with 7 ml of the dissociation solution and placed in a water bath (37?C) for 10 min under continuous stirring. The supernatant fraction containing single cells from each digestion period was collected in a conical 15 ml tube and spun at 500 g for 4 min, and the pellet was re-suspended in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) [containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO-BRL) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO-BRL)]. The tube with the dissociated cells was then placed in the incubator (37?C, 5% CO2). This procedure was repeated five to seven times or until the heart tissue was totally dissociated. The cells were pooled and preplated, in 100 mm plastic culture dishes for 1 h, to allow the non muscle cells to attach. Then, the remaining unattached cells, highly enriched in myocytes, were plated (2x105 cells/cm2) into 12.5 cm2 plastic culture flasks (Falcon, USA), placed in the incubator, and allowed to settle for 24 h. After this period, we washed the flasks with DMEM to remove the non-adherent cells and fed the cells with 3 ml of DMEM supplemented with cytosine  -D-arabino-furanoside (12.2 mg/50 ml media; Sigma) to inhibit fibroblast growth.;

To investigate the toxic effect of single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) on the immune system, we examined the influences of SWCNTs (depleted of metal impurities) on viability and global gene expression in murine macrophages. RAW264.7 Cells were exposed to various concentrations of SWCNTs, and cell viability was analyzed at various time points using WST-1 assay. SWCNT cytotoxicity in macrophages was concentration and time dependent, with significant viability loss occurring within 4 hr at 50  g/ml SWCNT exposure. As low as 1  g/ml SWCNTs reduced cell viability at 12 hr, whereas 50  g/ml SWCNT exposure completely abolished cell proliferation. Laser confocal microscopy indicated that SWCNTs could enter and aggregate in cell cytoplasm and nuclear areas. Microarray, real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that SWCNT altered gene and protein expression pattern. The most differentially expressed genes were related to proinflammatroy cytokines and chemokine, such as CCL-3 and CCL-4, apoptosis (e.g., Caspase-1, and -3), protective response such as Hmox-1and GSTM3) and cell surface molecules such as ICAM-1, Itgb2, indicating a possible involvement of SWCNT in inflammation and pulmonary granuloma formation, carcinogenesis and Th2 polarization of T cells. Furthermore, a substantial amount of down-regulated genes were related to ribosomal assembly and mitochondrial respiration chain, implicating a possible mechanism of SWCNT-induced oxidative stress and gene expression inhibition. The results are a first step in identifying molecular targets for the toxicity of SWCNTs and the elucidating of the molecular mechanisms for the immune modulation ability of SWCNTs.

In this report, we demonstrate a stress-dependent interaction between CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) and Daxx, death domain-associated protein. This interaction interferes with the stress-dependent association of HIPK2 with Daxx, blocking phosphorylation of serine 46 in p53 and inhibiting the p53-dependent apoptotic program. Microarray analysis confirmed suppression of the p53-dependent transcriptional portrait in CHIP (+/+) but not in CHIP (-/-) heat shocked MEFs. The interaction between CHIP and Daxx results in ubiquitination of Daxx which is then partitioned to an insoluble compartment of the cell. In vitro ubiquitination of Daxx by CHIP revealed that Ub chain formation utilizes non canonical lysine linkages associated with resistance to proteasomal degradation. CHIP's ubiquitination of Daxx utilizes lysines 630 and 631 and competes with the cell's sumoylation machinery at these residues. These studies implicate CHIP as a stress-dependent regulator of Daxx that counters Daxx's pro-apoptotic influence in the cell. By abrogating p53-dependent apoptotic pathways and by ubiquitination competitive with Daxx sumoylation, CHIP integrates the cell's proteotoxic stress response with cell cycle pathways that influence cell survival.  Keywords: p53, apoptosis, cell stress, ubiquitination We utilized a    sample x reference    experimental design strategy in which RNA extracted from mouse embryonic fibroblasts was hybridized to the microarray slide in the presence of labeled Universal Mouse Reference RNA (UMRR, Stratagene, LaJolla, CA).

Nevertheless, limited data are available on its developmental control or molecular phenotype. We used a novel AV node-specific reporter mouse to gain insight into the gene programs determining the formation and phenotype of the AV node. In the transgenic reporter, green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was driven by 160 kbp of Tbx3 and flanking sequences. GFP was selectively expressed in the AV canal of embryos, and in the AV node of adults, while all other Tbx3+ conduction system components, including the AV bundle, were devoid of GFP expression. Fluorescent AV nodal (Tbx3BAC-Egfp) and complementary working (NppaBAC336-Egfp) myocardial cell populations of E10.5 embryos and E17.5 fetuses were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and their expression profiles were assessed by microarray analysis. We constructed a comprehensive list of sodium, calcium, and potassium channels specific for the nodal or working myocard. Furthermore, the data revealed that the AV node and the working myocardium phenotypes diverge during development, but that the functional gene classes characteristic for both compartments are maintained. Interestingly, the AV node-specific gene repertoire consisted of multiple neurotrophic factors not yet appreciated to play a role in nodal development.  These data present the first genome-wide transcription profiles of the AV node during development, providing valuable information concerning its molecular identity.

Amacrine cells, a diverse class of inhibitory interneurons, are thought to mediate the majority of the processing of the visual signal that occurs within the retina.  Despite morphological characterization, the number of known molecular markers of amacrine cell types is still much smaller than the 26 morphological types that have been identified. Furthermore, it is not known how this diversity arises during development.  Here, we have combined in vivo genetic labeling and single cell genome-wide expression profiling to: 1) Identify specific molecular types of amacrine cells; 2) Demonstrate the molecular diversity of the amacrine cell class. It is difficult to identify new markers of amacrine cells, due to the fact that they only comprise a small percentage of the total cells in the retina.  Additionally, given that there are at least 26 distinct types of amacrine cells, population based approaches fail to achieve the precision necessary to discover markers of each type.  To facilitate the identification of new markers for different amacrine cell classes and to more fully characterize the molecular signatures of these classes, we isolated single amacrine cells.  To accomplish this goal, we introduced genetic reporters (pNdrg4::GFP or pSynapsin::GFP) into the developing retina (P0) by either in vivo or ex vivo electroporation.  These reporters were observed to label morphologically distinct sets of amacrine cells at the different timepoints harvested in this study.  Electroporated retinas were then dissociated at different time points and single retinal amacrine cells were isolated by virtue of their GFP expression and placed in tubes containing lysis buffer.  Then, their mRNAs were reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNAs were PCR amplified for 35 cycles.

It has also been reported to oppose terminal granulopoiesis and to support leukemic cell growth through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms.  We used kinetic microarray, Northern Blotting and bioinformatics analysis of IL-3 dependent myeloblasts to determine whether IL-3 acts in part by regulating the rate of turnover of mRNA transcripts in specific functional pathways.  Our results indicate that exposure of myeloblasts to IL-3 causes immediate early stabilization of hundreds of transcripts in pathways relevant to myeloblast function.  Examples include transcripts associated with proliferation and leukemic transformation (pik3cd, myb, pim-1), hematopoietic development (cited2), differentiation control (cdkn1a) and RNA processing (BRF1, BRF2).  A domain in the 3   -utr of IL-6 that mediates IL-3 responsiveness contains AU-rich elements that bind proteins known to modulate mRNA stability, however a known destabilizing protein (AUF1) is shown not to mediate degradation in the absence of IL-3.    These findings support a model of IL-3 action through mRNA stability control and suggest that aberrant stabilization of this network of transcripts could contribute to growth patterns observed in leukemia. Cells were exposed to actinomycin D to block transcription for 0, 2 or 4 hours. The cytokine IL-3 was added after actinomycin D either at a high (1 ng/ml) or low (10 pg/ml) concentration.

There is currently little information on additional proteins in the murine Piwi complex and how they might regulate the entry of transcripts that accumulate as piRNAs in the Piwi ribonucleoprotein (piRNP). We isolated Mili-containing complexes from adult mouse testes and identified Tudor domain-containing protein 1 (Tdrd1) as a factor specifically associated with the Mili piRNP throughout spermatogenesis. Complex formation is promoted by the recognition of symmetrically dimethylated arginines at the N-terminus of Mili by the Tudor domains of Tdrd1. Similar to a Mili mutant, mice lacking Tdrd1 show derepression of L1 transposons accompanied by a loss of DNA methylation of their regulatory elements, and delocalization of Miwi2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Finally, we show that Mili piRNPs devoid of Tdrd1 accept the entry of abundant cellular transcripts into the piRNA pathway and accumulate piRNAs with a profile that is drastically different from the wild-type. Our data suggests that Mili recruits Tdrd1 to ensure only the entry of transcripts that contribute to its normal piRNA pool.

We have characterized the transcriptome of Itk-deficient CD3+ T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, using Affymetrix microarrays. The largest difference between Itk-/- and Wt CD3+ T-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g. for killer cell lectin-like receptors. Compared to anti-CD3-stimulation, anti-CD3/CD28 significantly decreased the number of transcripts suggesting that the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is mainly independent of Itk. The signatures of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total CD3+ cells. Cyclosporin (CsA)-treatment had a stronger effect on transcriptional regulation than Itk-deficiency, suggesting that only a fraction of TCR-mediated calcineurin/NFAT-activation is dependent on Itk. Bioinformatic analysis of NFAT-sites of the group of transcripts similarly regulated by Itk-deficiency and CsA-treatment, followed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealed NFATc1-binding to the Bub1, IL7R, Ctla2a, Ctla2b, and Schlafen1 genes. Finally, to identify transcripts that are regulated by Tec-family kinases in general, we compared the expression profile of Itk-deficient T-cells with that of Btk-deficient B-cells and a common set of transcripts was found. Taken together, our study provides a general overview about the global transcriptional changes in the absence of Itk. CD3+ CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from pooled suspensions of spleen and lymph nodes of Wt and Itk knockout mice on C57BL/6 background were isolated after negative depletion. Unstimulated as well as stimulated T-cells were studied. Stimulations were done with anti-CD3 (1 mg/ml) for 24 hrs. For the CD4+ T-cells we collected triplicates from the Itk knockout mice and duplicates from the Wt group. For the CD8+ T-cells, we got duplicates from Itk knockout , while we obtained a single sample from Wt owing to the low cell yield for resting Wt CD8+ T-cells.

By contrast, disruption of Keap1 (a cytoplasmic modifier of Nrf2 turnover) protects against these stresses in mice; although dominant negative mutations in Keap1 have been identified recently in some human cancers.  Global characterization of Nrf2 activation is important to exploit this pathway for chemoprevention in healthy, yet at-risk individuals and also to elucidate the consequences of hijacking the pathway in Keap1-mutant human cancers.  This analysis also enables a global characterization of the pharmacodynamic action of CDDO-Im at a low dose that is relevant to chemoprevention. Liver-targeted conditional Keap1-null (CKO) mice provide a model of genetic activation of Nrf2 signaling.  By coupling global gene expression analysis of CKO mice with analysis of pharmacologic activation using the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid CDDO-Im, we are able to gain insight into pathways affected by Nrf2 activation.  CDDO-Im is an extremely potent activator of Nrf2 signaling.  CKO mice were used to identify genes modulated by genetic activation of Nrf2 signaling.  The CKO response was compared to hepatic global gene expression changes in wild-type mice treated with CDDO-Im at a maximal Nrf2 activating dose.  n=3/group, male 9 week old mice were used.

This difference may demand distinct immune responses. However, the mechanism to induce the distinct immune responses in mucous and skin is largely unknown. Dendritic cells of mucosa and skin are crucial in the initiation of immune responses, maintenance of self-tolerance and antigens presentation T cells. The different functions between mucosal and epidermal dendritic cells may play an important role in different immune responses. To compare the different gene expression of the mucosal DC and Langerhans cells (LC), we utilized microarrays to investigate different gene expression profiles in mucosal DC isolated from PPs (PDC) and epidermal LC from skin (ELC). 3548 genes were shown to be differentially expressed between PDC and ELC. According to genes annotations, 105 genes may be involved in immunity process. The genes involved in immune process were categorized to five groups related to DC function, including antigen presentation, antigen uptake, cytokines chemokines, and receptors, cell surface molecules and signal transduction. 11 of the highest expressed genes were selected as the candidate genes and reformed by real-time PCR. These 11 selected genes might be suitable candidates to further study the difference of gene expression between mucosal DC and epidermal LC and would be used for design for new vaccine. Beads and FACS sort were used to isolate dendritic cells from Peyer's patches and epidermal of skin from 80 four-week-old female BALB/c mice. Dendritic cells from Peyer's patches were pooled as one sample, and dendritic cells from epidermal of skin were pooled as another sample.

Gene silencing by Xist is restricted to special developmental contexts found in cells of the early embryo and specific hematopoietic precursors. The absence of critical silencing factors might explain why Xist cannot silence outside these contexts. Here, we show that Xist can also initiate silencing in a lymphoma model. Using the tumor context we identify the special AT rich binding protein SATB1 as an essential silencing factor. We show that loss of SATB1 in tumor cells abrogates the silencing function of Xist. In normal female lymphocytes Xist localizes along SATB1 filaments and, importantly, forced Xist expression can relocalize SATB1 into the Xist cluster. This reciprocal influence on localization suggests a molecular interaction between Xist and SATB1. SATB1 and its close homologue SATB2 are expressed during the initiation window for X inactivation in embryonic stem cells and are recruited to surround the Xist cluster. Furthermore, ectopic expression SATB1 or SATB2 enables gene silencing by Xist in embryonic fibroblasts, which normally do not provide an initiation context. Thus, SATB1 functions as a crucial initiation factor and may act to organize genes for silencing by Xist during the initiation of X inactivation.

We previously showed that Sall4 absence leads to lethality during peri-implantation and that Sall4-null embryonic stem (ES) cells proliferate poorly with intact pluripotency when cultured on feeder cells. However, a subsequent report indicated that shRNA-mediated Sall4 inhibition in ES cells led to a severe reduction in Oct3/4 and a secondary increase in Cdx2, which resulted in complete differentiation into the trophectoderm when cultured in the feeder-free condition. So we profiled gene expression changes when Sall4 is deleted in ES cells in the presence or absence of feeder cells.  key word: embryonic stem (ES) cell, Sall4, feeder ES cells were cultured with or without mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells in LIF-supplemented medium as described.

Mice fed long-term a high fat diet, in which medium-chain alpha linoleic acid (ALA) was partially replaced by long-chain docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) fatty acids, showed reduced accumulation of body fat and prevention of insulin resistance, besides increased mitochondrial beta-oxidation in white adipose tissue and decreased plasma lipids. ALA, EPA and DHA all belong to PUFA of n-3 series. The intestine is a gatekeeper organ for ingested lipids. To examine the potential contribution of the intestine in the beneficial effects of EPA and DHA, this study assessed gene expression changes using whole genome microarray analysis on small intestinal scrapings. The main biological process affected was lipid metabolism. Fatty acid uptake, peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation, and omega-oxidation of fatty acids were all increased. Quantitative real time PCR and intestinal fatty acid oxidation measurements ([14C(U)]-palmitate) confirmed significant gene expression differences in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, no major changes in the expression of lipid metabolism genes were observed in colonic scrapings. In conclusion, we show that marine n-3 fatty acids regulate small intestinal gene expression patterns. Since this organ contributes significantly to whole organism energy use, this adaptation of the small intestine may contribute to the complex and observed beneficial physiological effects of these natural compounds under conditions that will normally lead to development of obesity and diabetes. Male 4-month-old C57BL/6J mice were maintained for 4 weeks on semisynthetic high-fat (20% wt/wt) diets differing in the composition of n-3 PUFA. Two isocaloric diets were used (n=12): control sHFf diet which contained flax-seed oil (rich in ALA) as the only lipid source, or the sHFf-F2 diet, which had the same composition except that 44 % of the lipids were replaced by a n-3 PUFA concentrate (EPA&DHA) containing 6 % EPA and 51 % DHA (EPAX 1050TG; EPAX AS, Lysaker, Norway). Quality control of RNA samples showed that four samples did not pass quality thresholds, and these samples were excluded from array analysis (two control small intestine samples and one EPA&DHA small intestine sample). The remaining RNA samples were pooled per tissue per diet group. Thus; the flax-seed (control) array was hybridized with RNA pooled from of 10 mice, the PUFA array was hybridized with RNA pooled from 11 mice. ..

Myostatin depletion affected the expression of several hundred genes at nominal P < 0.01, but fewer than a hundred effects were statistically significant according to a more stringent criterion (false discovery rate < 5%). Most of the effects were less than 1.5-fold in magnitude. In contrast to previously-reported effects of constitutive myostatin knockout, postdevelopmental knockout did not downregulate expression of genes encoding slow isoforms of contractile proteins or genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism. Several collagen genes were expressed at lower levels in the myostatin-deficient muscles, and this led to reduced tissue collagen levels as reflected by hydroxyproline content. Myostatin knockout tended to down-regulate the expression of sets of genes with promoter motifs for Smad3, Smad4, myogenin, NF-  B, serum response factor, and numerous other transcription factors. Main conclusions: in mature muscle, myostatin is a key transcriptional regulator of collagen genes, but not genes encoding contractile proteins or genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism.

The largest ubiquitin E3 subclass consists of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which contain one each of several cullins (CUL1, -2, -3, -4, or -5) and RING proteins (RBX1 or -2). CRLs are activated by ligation of the UBL NEDD8 to a conserved cullin lysine. How is cullin NEDD8ylation specificity established? Here we report that, like UBE2M (also known as UBC12), the previously uncharacterized E2 UBE2F is a NEDD8-conjugating enzyme in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and structural analyses indicate how plasticity of hydrophobic E1-E2 interactions and E1 conformational flexibility allow one E1 to charge multiple E2s. The E2s have distinct functions, with UBE2M/RBX1 and UBE2F/RBX2 displaying different target cullin specificities. Together, these studies reveal the molecular basis for and functional importance of hierarchical expansion of the NEDD8 conjugation system in establishing selective CRL activation.

We analyzed the copy number content of the mouse genome to a sub-10 kb resolution. We identified over 1,300 copy number variant regions (CNVRs), most of which are < 10 kb in length, are found in more than one strain, and, in total, span 3.2% (85 Mb) of the genome. To assess the potential functional impact of copy number variation, we mapped expression profiles of purified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, adipose tissue and hypothalamus to CNVRs in cis. Of the more than 600 significant associations between CNVRs and expression profiles, most map to CNVRs outside of the transcribed regions of genes. In hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, up to 28% of strain-dependent expression variation is associated with copy number variation, supporting the role of germ line CNVs as major contributors to natural phenotypic variation in the laboratory mouse. To map the CNV content of the mouse genome, we selected 17 Tier 1-3 Mouse Phenome Project strains and three additional strains of biomedical interest, representing all major inbred lineages.  We performed comparative genomic hybridization using a long-oligonucleotide array containing 2,149,887 probes evenly spaced across the reference genome with a median inter-probe spacing of 1,015 bases.  Labeling, hybridization, washing and array imaging were performed as previously described (PMID:16075461).  We performed segmentation using wuHMM, a Hidden Markov Model algorithm that utilizes sequence-level information and can detect CNVs less than 5 kb in length (fewer than five probes) at a low false positive rate (PMID:18334530).

However, progress toward improved clinical treatments is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the genetic programs controlling early cardiogenesis. To better understand this process, we set out to identify genes whose expression is enriched within early cardiac fated populations, obtaining the transcriptional signatures of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) differentiating along a cardiac path.   We compared the RNA profiles of cardiac precursors cells (CPCs) with time-matched non-CPCs and undifferentiated mESCs, using a transgenic mESC line harboring an Nkx2-5 cardiac-specific regulatory sequence driving green fluorescent protein (GFP) to facilitate selection of CPCs. Approximately 24% (43/176) of the transcripts enriched in the CPC population have known roles in cardiac function or development. Importantly, we evaluated the biological relevance of a subset 31/133 (23%) of the remaining candidate genes by in situ hybridization and report that all were expressed in key cardiac structures during cardiogenesis (embryonic day, E7.5 - 9.5), many of which were previously uncharacterized. These data demonstrate the power of mESC differentiation to model specific developmental processes and provide a valuable resource that may be mined to further elucidate the genetic programs underlying cardiogenesis.

This is the case both in transgenic mice, where Galgt2 overexpression occurs from embryonic timepoints onward and in mdx mice where Galgt2 is overexpressed in the early postnatal period using Adeno-associated virus (AAV).  Here, we use gene expression profiling to compare transcriptional changes resulting from embryonic and postnatal Galgt2 overexpression in mdx skeletal muscle.  A surprising number of changes were in genes known to ameliorate muscular dystrophy when overexpressed (agrin, integrin alpha 7, ADAM12, Bcl2) or to cause muscular dystrophy when mutated (collagen VI (alpha1,alpha2), plectin 1, dystroglycan, selenoprotein N1, integrin alpha7, biglycan, dysferlin).    Several genes involved in calcium homeostasis were also changed.  In Galgt2 transgenic mice, where embryonic overexpression of Galgt2 in skeletal muscles alters neuromuscular development and muscle growth, the number of gene expression changes was vastly greater, however, 14% of genes altered in postnatal AAV-Galgt2 infected mdx muscles were also changed with embryonic overexpression.  These experiments suggest that postnatal overexpression of Galgt2 inhibits muscular dystrophy in mdx mice via induction of a group of genes that, in aggregate, can govern membrane stability, membrane repair, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis.

Here we use a transgenic DS mouse model to show that DYRK1A gene dosage imbalance deregulates chromosomal clusters of genes located near neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) binding sites. We found that DYRK1A binds the SWI/SNF-complex known to interact with REST/NRSF. Mutation of a REST/NRSF binding site in the promoter of the REST/NRSF target gene L1cam modifies the transcriptional effect of Dyrk1A-dosage imbalance on L1cam. DyrkA dosage imbalance perturbs Rest/Nrsf levels with decreased Rest/Nrsf expression in embryonic neurons and increased expression in adult neurons. We identified a coordinated deregulation of multiple genes that are responsible for the cellular phenotypic traits present in DS such as dendritic growth impairment and microcephaly during prenatal cortex development. Dyrk1a overexpression in primary mouse cortical neurons reduced the neuritic complexity. In the postnatal hippocampus, DYRK1A overexpression suppresses a form of synaptic plasticity that may be sufficient to cause DS cognitive defects. We propose that DYRK1A overexpression-related neuronal gene deregulation generates the brain phenotypic changes that characterize DS, with an accessory role for the gene dosage imbalance of other chromosome 21 genes.

Exposure of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to 1D8 cells, a murine model of ovarian carcinoma, suppresses their ability to express CD40 and stimulate antigen specific responses in response to PAMPs, and in particular to poly I: C with the upregulated SOCS3 transcript and protein levels. The ectopic expression of SOCS3 in both the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and BMDCs decreased signaling in response to both poly I:C and IFN  . Further, knockdown of SOCS3 transcripts significantly enhanced the responses of RAW264.7 and BMDCs to both poly I: C and IFN  . Immunoprecipitation and pull-down studies demonstrate that SOCS3 binds to the IFN   receptor TYK2. Since poly I: C triggers autocrine IFN   signaling, binding of SOCS3 to TYK2 may thereby suppress the activation of BMDCs by polyI:C and IFN  . Thus, elevated levels of SOCS3 in tumor-associated DCs may potentially resist the signals induced by TLR3 ligands and type I interferon to decrease DC activation via binding with IFN   receptor TyK2.

To understand the mechanism underlying the roles of these complexes in ES cells, we performed high-resolution genome-wide mapping of the core ATPase subunit, Brg, using ChIP-Seq technology. We find that that esBAF, as represented by Brg, binds to genes encoding components of the core ES transcriptional circuitry, including Polycomb group proteins. esBAF colocalizes extensively with Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog genome-wide, and shows distinct functional interactions with Oct4 and Sox2 at its target genes. Surprisingly, no significant colocalization of esBAF with PRC2 complexes, represented by Suz12, is observed. Lastly, esBAF co-binds with Stat3 and Smad1 genome-wide, consistent with a direct and critical role in LIF and BMP signaling essential to maintain pluripotency. Taken together, our studies indicate that esBAF is both an essential component of the core pluripotency transcriptional network, and might also be a critical component of the LIF and BMP signaling pathways essential for maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency.

In this study, we used microarray analysis to compare genomewide expression patterns during active regeneration after injury with calvaria in skeletally immature and mature mice. Parietal bone defects were created in 6-day-old (juvenile) and 60-day-old (adult) mice using a 4-mm trephine bit (n = 20 mice per age group). The calvarial disc was removed, leaving the underlying dura mater intact. Two weeks after injury, the region of regeneration with the underlying dura mater was harvested, and RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. The 25 most differentially upregulated genes in juvenile regenerates compared with adults were listed, as well as selected bone-related genes. In addition, QRT-PCR confirmation of specific genes was performed for validation. Juvenile regenerates expressed significantly greater amounts of BMP-2, -4, -7, as well as FGF-2 and its receptor FGFR-1. Various other growth factors were also noted to be upregulated, including IGF-2 and Ptn. This corresponded with the increased expression of markers for osteogenic differentiation of Sparc and Oc. Markers of osteoclast activity, Acp5, Ctsk, and Mmp2, were noted to be greater in juvenile regenerates compared with adults. The observation of Mmp14 upregulation, however, highlights the importance of balanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption for ultimate healing. The 2 most differentially regulated genes, transthyretin (Ttr) and prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds), highlight the potential role of retinoic acid signaling and the prostaglandin axis on skeletal regeneration.

So far, the function of OBF1 has been mainly identified in late stage B cell populations. The central defect of OBF1 deficient mice is a severely reduced immune response to T cell-dependent antigens and a lack of germinal center formation in the spleen. Relatively little is known about a potential function of OBF1 in developing B cells. Here we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing OBF1 in B cells under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter and enhancer. Surprisingly, these mice have greatly reduced numbers of follicular B cells in the periphery and have a compromised immune response. Furthermore, B cell differentiation is impaired at an early stage in the bone marrow. A first block is observed during B cell commitment and a second differentiation block is seen at the large preB2 cell stage. The cells that succeed to escape the block and to differentiate into mature B cells have post-translationally downregulated the expression of transgene, indicating that expression of OBF1 beyond the normal level early in B cell development is deleterious. Indeed ID3, which is a negative regulator of B cell differentiation, is upregulated in the EPLM and preB cells of the transgenic mice. Furthermore ID3 promoter contains an octamer site suggesting that it is a potential OBF-1 direct target gene.

Keywords: Sry transgene Four Core Genotype Mouse liver Tissue Liver tissue from the "Four Core Genotype" treated group consists of 20 female and male C57BL/6J mice fed a chow diet containing 4% fat (Ralston-Purina Co., St. Louis, MO) until 8 weeks of age and then were gonadectomized at 8 weeks of life.  In mice of the "four core genotypes" (FCG), the Y chromosome is deleted for the testis-determining gene Sry, producing the Y- chromosome.  The Sry transgene is inserted onto an autosome, so that testis determination is independent of the complement of sex chromosomes.

In  Drosophila, Hippo signaling controls organ size by regulating the activity of a TEAD  transcription factor, Scalloped, through modulation of its coactivator protein Yki. The  role of mammalian Tead proteins in growth regulation, however, remains unknown.  Here we examined the role of mouse Tead proteins in growth regulation. In NIH3T3  cells, cell density and Hippo signaling regulated the activity of Tead proteins by  modulating nuclear localization of a Yki homologue, Yap, and the resulting change in  Tead activity altered cell proliferation. Tead2-VP16 mimicked Yap overexpression,  including increased cell proliferation, reduced cell death, promotion of EMT, lack of cell  contact inhibition, and promotion of tumor formation. Growth promoting activities of  various Yap mutants correlated with their Tead-coactivator activities. Tead2-VP16 and  Yap regulated largely overlapping sets of genes. However, only a few of the Tead/Yapregulated  genes in NIH3T3 cells were affected in Tead1-/-;Tead2-/- or Yap-/- embryos. Most  of the previously identified Yap-regulated genes were not affected in NIH3T3 cells or  mutant mice. In embryos, levels of nuclear Yap and Tead1 varied depending on cell  types. Strong nuclear accumulation of Yap and Tead1 were seen in myocardium,  correlating with requirements of Tead1 for proliferation. However, their distribution did  not always correlate with proliferation. Taken together, mammalian Tead proteins  regulate cell proliferation and contact inhibition as a transcriptional mediator of Hippo  signaling, but the mechanisms by which Tead/Yap regulate cell proliferation differ  depending on cell types, and Tead, Yap and Hippo signaling may play multiple roles in  mouse embryos. We used microarrays to know the gene expression profiles regurated by Tead2-VP16, Tead2-EnR, Yap, and cell density in NIH3T3 cells.

Based on previously well-documented anti-tumor activity of CLA in rodent models of breast cancer, a pilot study was initiated to examine the effect of dietary CLA in a well-established transgenic model of breast cancer.  Western blots were performed for the detection of AKT, c-Src, ERK1/2, and Cdc24. CLA significantly increased tumor burden (p<0.1) independent of an increase in oncogenic signaling. Mammary gland whole mounts indicated a loss of mammary adipose and extensive epithelial expansion in CLA-treated animals. Microarray analysis indicated a significant reduction in cytoskeletal related genes with at least a two-fold decrease in five out of six CLA-fed animals compared to untreated controls. Reduction of Cdc42, a key regulator of cell adhesion and cytoskeletal arrangements, was confirmed at the protein level by western blot (p<0.01). These findings suggest that dietary CLA may advance the malignant phenotype by promoting a loss of cell polarity and adhesion in the mammary gland epithelium. This action may have serious clinical implications for a subset high-risk population and warrants further investigation. Virgin, four-week-old PyV-mT mice were administered a diet of a mixed-isomer CLA formulation (1% wt/wt) (N=6) or control AIN96G diet (N=5) for four weeks. Measurements of food disappearance, weights and palpations were recorded weekly. All animals were euthanized at eight weeks of age.  Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mammary gland tissue was used for H&E and trichrome staining and immunohistochemistry for Ki67. Tissue levels of CLA were measured by gas chromatography. Thoracic mammary glands were fixed in glacial acetic acid:ethanol and carmine stained. cDNA microarray was performed on RNA from 6 CLA-fed mice and 4 control mice using the Affymetrix 430 2.0 mouse genome chips. .. 8 weeks;  No;  Female;  FVB/PyV-Mt;  Mammary gland;  total RNA;  mouse fed 1% CLA;  mouse fed control chow;  10090;  Mus musculus;  PyV-MT expressing female mice were fed a diet supplemented with 1% conjugated linoleic acid or control chow for 4 weeks.

As demonstrated in the accompanying paper, Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), permits comprehensive studies of translated mRNAs in genetically defined cell populations following physiological perturbations. To establish the generality of this approach, we present translational profiles for twenty four CNS cell populations, and identify known cell-specific and enriched transcripts for each population. We report thousands of cell-specific mRNAs that were not detected in whole tissue microarray studies, and provide examples that demonstrate the benefits deriving from comparative analysis. To provide a foundation for further biological and in silico studies, we provide a resource of sixteen transgenic mouse lines, their corresponding anatomic characterization, and translational profiles for cell types from a variety of CNS structures. This resource will enable a wide spectrum of molecular and mechanistic studies of both well known and previously uncharacterized neural cell populations.  Keywords: Cell Type Comparison For each cell population, three independent TRAP replicates were collected, and total RNA from both the immunoprecipitate and unbound fractions were seperately amplified and hybridized.For each tissue, several representative unbound fractions are provided to serve as controls.  Biological replicates are GCRMA normalized within groups.Following averaging of replicates, we recommend further global normalization between groups, using affymetrix biotinylated controls, to correct for any broad biases in scanning and hybridization.Finally for many analyses, we also recommend filtering to remove those probesets with low IP/UB fold change values from each cell type.Researchers can contact us for spreadsheets where these additional steps have been completed. ..

These mice had reduced median survival due to an increase in tumor incidence and multiplicity in the cecum and the proximal colon; they differed from murine intestinal tumors of the Apc1638N type which normally arise solely in the small intestine. We have examined by micro-array analysis three cecal tumors from these mice (probable adenomas), and compared them to three duodenal tumors (probable adenocarcinomas). Expression profiles of duodenal and cecal tumors relative to each other show unique gene subsets up and down regulated. The two tumor types were subsequently shown to differentially regulate distinct sets of genes over expressed in a majority of human colorectal carcinomas.

However, changes in CNS gene expression following morphine exposure are poorly understood. We studied the effect of short- and long-term morphine treatment on gene expression in the hypothalamus and pituitary using genome-wide DNA microarray and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. In the hypothalamus, we found that short-term morphine administration up-regulated (at least 2-fold) 39 genes and down-regulated six genes. Long-term morphine administration up-regulated 35 genes and down-regulated 51 hypothalamic genes. In the pituitary, we found that short-term morphine administration up-regulated (at least 2-fold) 110 genes and down-regulated 29 genes. Long-term morphine administration up-regulated 85 genes and down-regulated 37 pituitary genes. Strikingly, microarray analysis uncovered several genes involved in food intake (neuropeptide Y, agouti-related protein, and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript) whose expression was strongly altered by morphine exposure in either the hypothalamus or pituitary. Subsequent RT-PCR analysis confirmed similar gene regulation of noteworthy genes in these regions. Finally, we found functional correlation between morphine-induced alterations in food intake and regulations of genes involved in this process. Changes in genes related to food intake may uncover new pathways related to some of the physiological effects of opioids.

In many but not all cases, dietary supplementation with folate significantly reduces the severity and incidence of these conditions. Common polymorphisms modulate these metabolic pathways and disease risks, but do not fully account for the particular birth defects and adult diseases that occur in at-risk individuals.  To test whether other pathways contribute to disease pathogenesis, we analyzed global and pathway-specific changes in gene expression and levels of selected metabolites after depletion and repletion of dietary folate in two genetically distinct inbred strains of mice.  Compared to the C57BL/6J strain, A/J showed greater homeostatic response to folate perturbation by retaining a higher serum folate level and minimizing global gene expression changes.  Remarkably, folate perturbation led to systematic strain-specific differences only in the expression profile of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and translated to changes in levels of serum and liver total cholesterol.  By genetically increasing serum and liver total cholesterol levels in APOE deficient mice, we modestly but significantly improved folate retention during folate depletion, suggesting an interplay between homocysteine and folate metabolism and cholesterol metabolism.  Absence of measurable changes in global methylation patterns or amelioration of effects with supplementation with an alternative methyl donor suggest that dietary folate perturbations do not act through large-scale or general changes in methylation. These results suggest that homeostatic responses in cholesterol metabolism contribute to the beneficial effects of dietary folate supplementation.

The development of the vertebrate limb is an important paradigm for understanding these processes. The skeletal and connective tissues of the developing limb all derive from a population of multipotent progenitor cells located in its distal tip. During limb outgrowth, these progenitors segregate into a chondrogenic lineage, located in the center of the limb bud, and soft connective tissue lineages located in its periphery. We report that the interplay of two families of signaling proteins, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and Wnts, coordinate the growth of the multipotent progenitor cells with their simultaneous segregation into these lineages. FGF and Wnt signals act together to synergistically promote proliferation while maintaining the cells in an undifferentiated, multipotent state, but act separately to determine cell lineage specification. Withdrawal of both signals results in cell cycle withdrawal and chondrogenic differentiation. Continued exposure to Wnt however, maintains proliferation and re-specifies the cells towards the soft connective tissue lineages. We have identified target genes that are synergistically regulated by Wnts and Fgfs, and show how these factors actively suppress differentiation and promote growth. Finally, we show how the spatial restriction of Wnt and FGF signals to the limb ectoderm and to a specialized region of it, the apical ectodermal ridge, controls the distribution of cell behaviors within the growing limb, and guides the proper spatial organization of the differentiating tissues.  Keywords: transcriptional response to growth factor treatment Cells derived from mouse embryonic stage 11.5 limb buds were cultured and treated with purified Wnt3a protein or vehicle controls.

Nuclear receptors bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region of target genes and v-erbA is known to exert a dominant negative effect on the activity of the RARs. The repressor activity of v-erbA has been linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a mouse model. We have used microarray analysis to identify genes differentially expressed in hepatocytes in culture (AML12 cells) stably transfected with v-erbA and exposed to RA.  We have found that v-erbA can affect expression of RA-responsive genes. We have also identified a number of v-erbA-responsive genes that are known to be involved in carcinogenesis and which may play a role in the development of HCC.

Cardiac titin undergoes developmental changes in isoform expression during the course of cardiac development. At present, at least five size classes of titin isoforms (N2B and N2BA-A1, A2, N1, N2) have been identified using SDS agarose gel electrophoresis. The larger titin isoform N2BAs gradually decreased with ages, in contrast, the smaller titin isoform N2B increased in normal cardiomyocyte, and cardiac myocytes containing a higher proportion of the smaller titin isoform N2B have stronger passive tension than that with a lower proportion of the larger titin isoform N2BAs. Recently we found an autosomal dominant mutation which caused totally opposite cardiac titin isoform expression as compared to developmental stages. The larger total titin isoform N2BA increased in mutant rat cardiac myocytes with ages instead of the smaller cardiac titin isoform N2B. For the moment, mechanism of titin isoform switch is still unknown, therefore, the mutant rats will give us nevol sight to elucidate the titin splicing mechanism. Keywords: Titin isoforms, autosomal dominant mutation Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol according to manufacturer instruction and further purified by the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (SuperScript II system; Invitrogen). An in vitro transcription reaction was then performed to obtain biotin-labeled cRNA from the double-stranded cDNA (Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit; Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). The cRNA was fragmented before hybridization, and then mixed in a hybridization mixture containing probe array controls, BSA, and herring sperm DNA. A cleanup procedure was performed on the hybridization cocktail using an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen), after which it was applied to the Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 probe array. Total eighteen hybridization experiments were performed in which each stage (1-day, 20-day and 49-day) was represented by three normal and three mutant individual ventricular RNA extracts. Hybridization was allowed to continue for 16 h at 45  C in a GeneChip 640 hybridization oven, after which the arrays were washed and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).

Many of these mutations occur in the BMPR2 tail domain, leaving the SMAD functions intact. In order to determine the in vivo consequences of BMPR2 tail domain mutation, we created a smooth-muscle specific doxycycline inducible BMPR2 mutation with an arginine to termination mutation at amino acid 899. When these SM22-rtTA x TetO7-BMPR2R899X mice had transgene induced for 9 weeks, starting at 4 weeks of age, they universally developed pulmonary vascular pruning as assessed by fluorescent microangiography. Approximately half the time the induced animals developed elevated right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP), associated with extensive pruning, muscularization of small pulmonary vessels, and development of large structural pulmonary vascular changes. These lesions included large numbers of macrophages and T-cells in their adventitial compartment, as well as CD133 positive cells in the lumen. Small vessels filled with CD45 positive and sometimes CD3 positive cells were a common feature in all SM22-rtTA x TetO7-BMPR2R899X mice. Gene array experiments show changes in stress response, muscle organization and function, proliferation and apoptosis, and developmental pathways before RVSP increases. Our results show that the primary phenotypic result of BMPR2 tail domain mutation in smooth muscle is pulmonary vascular pruning leading to elevated RVSP, associated with early dysregulation in multiple pathways with clear relevance to PAH. This model should be useful to the research community in examining early molecular and physical events in the development of PAH, and as a platform to validate potential treatments.

Such "non-genetic cell individuality" can arisefrom the slow fluctuations of protein levels in mammalian cells. Thesefluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering aclonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whetherthis heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fatedecisions in stem cells which depends on the kinetics that underliesheterogeneity.  Here we show that in clonal populations of hematopoieticprogenitor cells, spontaneous "outlier" cells with extremely high or lowexpression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 reconstitute theparental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week.This slow relaxation is described by a Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM) thatincorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations,suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despiteclonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although theunique gene expression profiles eventually reversed to that of themedian cells, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly differentproclivity for choosing either the erythroid or myeloid lineages. Preference in lineage choice was associated with elevated expression oflineage-specific transcription factors, such as > 200-fold increase inGATA1 among the erythroid-prone cells, or > 15-fold PU.1 expressionamong myeloid-prone cell. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expressionlevel is not due to independent noise in the expression of individualgenes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuatingtranscriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern thereversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cellfate decision.

Currently, there is no drug treatment to prevent or slow the development of DN.  Rosiglitazone (Rosi) is a potent insulin sensitizer and may also slow the development of DN by a mechanism independent of its effect on hyperglycemia.  A two by two design was used to test the effect of Rosi treatment on the development of DN.  Streptozotocin-induced diabetic DBA/2J mice were treated with Rosi.  DN and oxidative stress were quantified, and gene expression was profiled using the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray platform.  An informatics approach identified key regulatory elements activated by Rosi.  Diabetic DBA/2J mice developed severe hyperglycemia, DN and elevated oxidative stress.  Rosi treatment did not affect hyperglycemia but did reduce oxidative stress and prevented development of thermal hypoalgesia.  Two novel transcription factor binding modules were identified that may control genes correlated to changes in DN following Rosi treatment: SP1F_ZBPF and EGRF_EGRF.  Rosi treatment reduced oxidative stress and DN independent of its insulin sensitizing effects. Gene expression profiling identified two novel targets activated by Rosi treatment.  These targets may be useful in designing drugs with the same efficacy as Rosi in treating DN but with fewer undesirable effects.

Using in vivo selection, we identified a mammalian orthologue of the Drosophila polarity regulator crumbs as a gene whose loss of expression promotes tumor progression. Immortal baby mouse kidney epithelial (iBMK) cells selected in vivo to acquire tumorigenicity displayed dramatic repression of crumbs3 (crb3) expression associated with disruption of tight junction formation, apicobasal polarity, and contact-inhibited growth.  Restoration of crb3 expression restored junctions, polarity and contact inhibition, while suppressing migration and metastasis. These findings suggest a role for mammalian polarity determinants in suppressing tumorigenesis that may be analogous to the well-studied polarity tumor suppressor mechanisms in Drosophila. Keywords: Crumbs, crb3, tight junctions, polarity, metastasis, cancer Gene Expression analysis was carried out using the Affymetrix Mouse 430 A 2.0 chips representing about 22,629 full-length genes and ESTs.  Initial scaling was done using the Affymetrix  Microarray Suite Expression Software version 5.0 and subsequent analysis was done using GeneSpring Software version 6.1 ( Silicon Genetics).     (Tumor derived cell lines) /in vivo selected cell lines were compared to the parental cell lines from which they were derived.  We had two parental cell  line samples which were defined as replicates and treated as a single sample and 4 cell lines namely TD A, B, C and D derived from the parents.      Three different filtering conditions were applied.  First, we applied Expression Percentage Restriction retaining only those genes  which had a raw expression value of 80.0 or more in at least 1 out of the 5 samples being compared.  This enabled us to filter out the low-intensity values while retaining genes that may have a very low expression level in one sample but may be switched on in another sample.  The cut-off value of 80.00 was determined by analyzing the raw data of each of the chips being compared and estimating the average background expression value.  Of the 22,629 genes represented on the chips, 11,418 genes were retained.    Secondly, we filtered on data quality selecting for genes with a Flag value of Present (P) in all the samples being compared.  10,126 genes were retained after applying this filter.    We then carried out a pair-wise fold-change analysis comparing each tumor derived cell line to the parental cell-line.  We retained genes that underwent at least 2 folds or more up-regulation or down-regulation in the tumor derived cell l  ines, compared to the parentals.  1,010 genes were retained after this step.    In order to identify genes that underwent statistically significant changes in gene expression in the tumor derived cell-lines when compared to the parentals we applied a statistical filter analysis and performed the Student   s-t-test with a p value cut-off of 0.05.  Multiple testing correction was turned off.  We found 123 genes that were over-expressed and 5 that were underexpressed.    We carried out two-way hierarchical clustering using the GeneSpring Software 6.1 using standard correlation as similarity metric.  We also analyzed our data using Venn Diagrams in order to identify the statistically significant genes that were common to all 4 tumor derived cell-lines.

To address the hypothesis that environmental airway disease is, in part, a fibroproliferative lung disease, we exposed C57BL/6 mice daily to LPS by inhalation for up to two months followed by one month of recovery. C57BL/6 mice exposed to daily inhaled LPS had significantly enhanced mRNA expression of TGF-beta1, TIMP-1, fibronectin-1, and pro-collagen types I, III, and IV and show prominent submucosal expression of the myofibroblast markers desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. To identify novel candidate genes that contribute to airway fibroproliferation, we performed microarray analysis on total lung RNA from mice exposed to LPS for one week. This analysis revealed a distinct subset of genes known to regulate ECM homeostasis. To further identify candidate genes specifically involved in generic fibroproliferation we interrogated this analysis with genes induced in C57BL/6 mouse lung by bleomycin. This analysis yielded a list of 212 genes in common. Prominent among which are genes know to be important in maintenance of bone homeostasis and which may play a central role in ECM homeostasis in the lung.

However, the mechanisms by which these isoprenoids mediate their effects are not yet fully understood. In this study, we show that FOH is effective inducer of apoptosis in several lung carcinoma cells, including H460 cells. This induction is associated with activation of caspase-3, -9, and -12, and cleavage of PARP. To obtain insight into the mechanism involved in FOH-induced apoptosis, we compared the gene expression profiles of FOH-treated and control H460 cells using microarray analysis. This analysis revealed that many of the genes implicated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including ATF3, CHOP/GADD153, HERPUD1, BIP (GRP78), XBP1, PDIA4, and TDAG51, were highly up-regulated within 4 hr of FOH treatment suggesting that FOH-induced apoptosis involves an ER-stress response. This was supported by observations showing that treatment with FOH induces phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. FOH induces activation of several MAPK pathways, including p38, MEK-ERK, and JNK. Inhibition of MEK1/2 by U0126 inhibited the induction of ER stress-response genes. In addition, knockdown of the MEK1/2 and JNK1/2 expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively inhibited the induction of apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP by FOH. However, only MEK1/2 siRNAs reduced the expression of ER stress-related genes and inhibited phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Our results demonstrate that FOH-induced apoptosis is coupled to ER stress and that activation of MEK1/2 is an upstream event in the FOH-induced ER stress signaling cascade.

PRC2 catalyses trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) which in turn is thought to provide a recruitment site for PRC1. Recent studies demonstrate that mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2A at lysine 119 is important in PcG mediated silencing with the core PRC1 component Ring1A/B functioning as the E3 ligase8.  PRC2 has been shown to share target genes with the core transcription network to maintain embryonic stem (ES) cells including Oct4 and Nanog9. Here we identify an essential role for PRC1 in repressing developmental regulators in ES cells, and thereby in maintaining ES cell pluripotency. A significant proportion of the PRC1 target genes are also repressed by Oct4.  We demonstrate that engagement of PRC1 and PRC2 at target genes is Oct4-dependent and moreover that Ring1B interacts with Oct4. Collectively these results show that PcG complexes are instrumental in Oct4-dependent repression required to maintain pluripotency of ES cells. This study provides a first functional link between a core ES cell regulator and global epigenetic regulation of the genome.

Spleen or lymph node resident DCs are subdivided into conventional DC (cDC) subsets (CD11b and CD8alpha in mouse; BDCA1 and BDCA3 in man) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). It is currently unclear if these various DC populations belong to a unique hematopoietic lineage and if the subsets identified in the mouse and human systems are evolutionary homologs. To bring novel insights into these questions, we sought conserved genetic signatures for these DCs through the analysis of a compendium of genome-wide expression profiles of mouse or human leukocytes. We show through clustering analysis that all spleen resident DC subsets form a distinct branch within the leukocyte family tree, and reveal a transcriptomal signature evolutionary conserved in all these DC subsets. Moreover we identify a large gene expression program shared between mouse and human plasmacytoid DCs, and smaller conserved profiles shared between mouse and human cDC subsets. Finally, we use compendium analysis to re-evaluate the classification of interferon-producing killer DCs (IKDCs) and lin-CD16+HLA-DR+ cells, which have both been claimed to be DCs, and show that these cells are more closely linked to NK or myeloid cells, respectively. Our study thus provides a unique resource for future investigation of the evolutionarily conserved molecular pathways governing the ontogeny and functions of leukocyte subsets, especially DCs.

Cyp26a1 codes for the CYP26A1 enzyme which metabolizes RA to polar RA metabolites, such as 4-oxo-RA and 4-OH-RA.  CYP26A1-/- ES cells do not metabolize RA within 48 hours of RA treatment while in Wt ES cells, polar RA metabolites are already detectable by 8 hr.  In addition, the absence of CYP26A1 enzyme increases intracellular RA levels.  By gene microarray analysis, we wanted to identify genes that would be affected by the lack of the Cyp26a1 gene.

A new recombinant VACV, GLV-1h68, as a simultaneous diagnostic and therapeutic agent, was constructed by inserting three expression cassettes (encoding Renilla luciferase-green fluorescent protein (RUC-GFP) fusion, b-galactosidase, and b-glucuronidase) into the F14.5L, J2R (encoding thymidine kinase, TK), and A56R (encoding hemagglutinin, HA) loci of the viral genome, respectively. Intravenous (i.v.) injections of GLV-1h68 (1    107 pfu/mouse) into nude mice with established (500 mm3)  subcutaneous (s.c.) GI-101A human breast tumors were used to evaluate its toxicity, tumor targeting specificity and oncolytic efficacy. GLV-1h68 demonstrated an enhanced tumor targeting specificity and much reduced toxicity compared to its parental LIVP strains. The tumors colonized by GLV-1h68 exhibited growth, inhibition, and regression phases followed by tumor eradication within 130 days in 95% of the mice tested. Tumor regression in live animals was monitored in real time based on decreasing light emission, hence demonstrating the concept of a combined oncolytic virus-mediated tumor diagnosis and therapy system. Transcriptional profiling of regressing tumors based on a mouse-specific platform revealed gene expression signatures consistent with immune defense activation, inclusive of interferon stimulated genes (STAT-1 and IRF-7), cytokines, chemokines and innate immune effector function. These findings suggest that immune activation may combine with viral oncolysis to induce tumor eradication in this model, providing a novel perspective for the design of oncolytic viral therapies for human cancers. Objective: To determine the gene expression changes induced by GLV-1h68 vaccinia virus injection in mouse carrying human breast cancer implant and leading to tumor eradication. Methods: Gene expression was analyzed using oligonucleotide microarrays. Responsiveness to vaccina virus injection was assessed by toxicity and survival study, gene expression anaysis and tumor volume change. Result: The tumors colonized by GLV-1h68 exhibited growth, inhibition, and regression phases followed by tumor eradication within 130 days in 95% of the mice tested.

When performed comparatively, it may shed light on the mechanisms underlying host susceptibility. In this study, gene expression in the mouse colon was investigated in two cognate lines of mice that differ in their response to Citrobacter rodentium infection; susceptible inbred FVB/N (FVB) and resistant outbred Swiss Webster (SW) mice. Gene expression in the distal colon was investigated prior to infection and at 4 and 9 days post-inoculation using a whole mouse genome Affymetrix array. Computational analysis identified 462 (1%) probe sets differentially expressed by more than 2-fold between uninoculated SW and FVB mice. In response to C. rodentium infection, 5,123 probe sets (11.4%) were significantly modulated in one or both lines of mice. Microarray data were validated by quantitative real time RT-PCR on 35 selected genes (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and were found to have a 94% concordance. Transcripts represented by 1,547 probe sets (3.4%), were differentially expressed between FVB and SW mice regardless of infection status (host effect). Genes associated with transport were over-represented to a greater extent than immune response-related genes (25% vs. 11% of enrichment, respectively). Electrolyte analysis revealed hypochloremia and hyponatremia in susceptible animals. The results support the hypothesis that mortality in C. rodentium-infected FVB mice is associated with impaired ion transport and development of fatal hypovolemia. These studies contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of C. rodentium and suggest novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of diarrhea associated with bacterial infections of the intestinal tract. Keywords: temporal change (post infection) Global gene expression analysis was performed on the distal colon with 2-3 mice per group. Because no difference for any parameters was observed in uninfected mice at 4 or 9 dpi, the animals were pooled into an uninoculated control groups for each line of mouse.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for more effective intervention strategies. Both animal and human studies indicate that lipid oversupply to skeletal muscle can result in insulin resistance which is one of the charecteristices of the MS. C57BL/6J mice were fed a low fat (10 kcal%) palm oil diet or a high fat (45 kcal%; HF) palm oil diet for 3 or 28 days. By combining transcriptomics with protein and lipid analyses we aimed to better understand the molecular events underlying the early onset of the MS. Short-term HF-feeding led to altered expression levels of genes involved in a variety of biological processes including morphogenesis, energy metabolism, lipogenesis and immune function. Protein analysis showed increased levels of the myosin heavy chain, slow fiber type protein and the complexes II, III, IV and V of the oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, we observed that the main mitochondrial membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, contained more saturated fatty acids. Altogether, these results point to a morphological as well as a metabolic adaptation by promoting a more oxidative fiber type. We hypothesize that after this early adaptation, a continued transcriptional down-regulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation will result in decreased oxidative capacity at a later stage. Together with increased saturation of phospholipids of the mitochondrial membrane this can result in decreased mitochondrial function which is a hallmark observed in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

When the retinal photoreceptors detach from their epithelium, stress signals and apoptotic pathways are initiated that will lead to loss of vision, however accelerating the reattachment of these cells can prevent photoreceptor death and subsequent vision loss.  To determine the genes involved in this process, we performed a microarray screen using a mouse model or retinal detachment in conjunction with a P2Y2 agonist previously demonstrated to hasten retinal reattachment.  Keywords: disease state analysis and therapeutic analysis We conducted a microarray screen to identify genes involved in promoting faster resolution of retinal detachment.  Subretinal detachment was induced in Balb/cJ mice by subretinal injection of 1 uL saline or delivery of 1 uL of 10uM INS37217/Saline to cause detachment and expedite the rate of recovery.  We performed this study at three timepoints: 2 hrs post-injection to identify early response genes; 24 hrs post-detachment when the retina has reattached, but still grossly misfolded; and 7 days post-detachment when the misfolding has been resolved, but retinal function is merely 50% of wild-type function.

Nobox deficiency leads to rapid loss of postnatal oocytes. Early oocyte differentiation is poorly understood. We hypothesized that lack of Nobox perturbs global expression of genes preferentially expressed in oocytes as well as microRNAs.  We compared Nobox knockout and wild type ovaries using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray platform. We discovered that 28 out of 38 (74%) of the genes down-regulated more than five fold in the absence of Nobox were preferentially expressed in oocytes, while only 5 out of 33 (15%) of genes up-regulated more than five fold in the absence of Nobox, were preferentially expressed in oocytes. Protein binding microarray helped identify nucleotide motifs that NOBOX binds, and that several down-regulated genes contain within putative promoter regions. MicroRNA population in newborn ovaries deficient of Nobox, was largely unaffected. Genes whose proteins are predicted to be secreted, but previously unknown to be significantly expressed in early oogenesis, were down regulated in Nobox knockouts and included astacin-like metalloendopeptidase (Astl), Jagged 1 (Jag1), oocyte secreted protein 1 (Oosp1), fetuin beta (Fetub) and R-spondin 2 (Rspo2). In addition, pluripotency associated genes, Pou5f1 and Sall4 are drastically down-regulated in Nobox deficient ovaries, while testes determining gene Dmrt1 is over-expressed. Our findings indicate that Nobox is likely an activator of oocyte-specific gene expression, and suggest that oocyte plays an important role in suppressing expression of male determining genes such as Dmrt1. Keywords: Genetic Modification Newborn ovaries were pooled separately from wild type and Nobox -/- animals and total RNA isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, CA). Newborn ovaries were collected within 12 hours of delivery. Animal experimentation was approved by the  Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine. Three independently pooled RNA samples from wild type and Nobox -/- newborn ovaries were used to generate biotinylated cRNA. Biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 2.0 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Since three independent experiments were performed from three independent pools of wild type and Nobox -/- RNA, signal intensities for particular genes were averaged between the three chips and ratio of the wild type over knockout signal calculated. Signal less than 100 was considered background. The raw data in the Affymetrix CEL files were normalized by the RMA method (robust multi-array analysis) [15, 16].

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) accelerate the osteoblast differentiation process by blocking the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs), which alter gene expression by modifying chromatin structure.  We previously demonstrated that HDIs and HDAC3 shRNAs accelerate matrix mineralization and the expression of osteoblast maturation genes (e.g. alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin).  Identifying other genes that are differentially regulated by HDIs might identify new pathways that contribute to osteoblast differentiation.  Results: To identify other osteoblast genes that are altered early by HDIs, we incubated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts with HDIs (trichostatin A, MS-275, or valproic acid) for 18 hours in osteogenic conditions.  The promotion of osteoblast differentiation by HDIs in this experiment was confirmed by osteogenic assays.  Gene expression profiles relative to vehicle-treated cells were assessed by microarray analysis with Affymetrix GeneChip 430 2.0 arrays. The regulation of several genes by HDIs in MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblasts was verified by quantitative real-time PCR.  Nine genes were differentially regulated by at least two-fold after exposure to each of the three HDIs and six were verified by PCR in osteoblasts. Four of the verified genes (solute carrier family 9 isoform 3 regulator 1 (Slc9a3r1), sorbitol dehydrogenase 1, a kinase anchor protein, and glutathione S-transferase alpha 4) were induced.  Two genes (proteasome subunit, beta type 10 and adaptor-related protein complex AP-4 sigma 1) were suppressed.  We also identified eight growth factors and growth factor receptor genes that are significantly altered by each of the HDIs, including Frizzled related proteins 1 and 4, which modulate the Wnt signaling pathway.  Conclusions: This study identifies osteoblast genes that are regulated early by HDIs and indicates pathways that might promote osteoblast maturation following HDI exposure. One gene whose upregulation following HDI treatment is consistent with this notion is Slc9a3r1.  Also known as NHERF1, Slc9a3r1 is required for optimal bone density.  Similarly, the regulation of Wnt receptor genes indicates that this crucial pathway in osteoblast development is also affected by HDIs.  These data support the hypothesis that HDIs regulate the expression of genes that promote osteoblast differentiation and maturation. Keywords: gene expression To identify other osteoblast genes that are altered early by HDIs, we incubated MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts with HDIs (trichostatin A, MS-275, or valproic acid) or the vehicle control (DMSO) for 18 hours in osteogenic conditions.

The phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is involved in lymphoid development. Defects in single components of this pathway prevent thymocytes from progressing beyond early T cell developmental stages. Protein kinase B (PKB) is the main effector of the PI3K pathway. To determine whether PKB mediates PI3K signaling in early T cell development, we characterized PKB knockout thymi. Our results reveal a significant thymic hypocellularity in PKBalpha-/- neonates and an accumulation of early thymocyte subsets in PKBalpha-/- adult mice. The latter finding is specifically attributed to the lack of PKBalpha within the lymphoid component of the thymus. Microarray analyses show that the absence of PKBalpha in early thymocyte subsets modifies the expression of genes known to be involved in pre-TCR signaling, in T cell activation, and in the transduction of interferon-mediated signals. This report highlights the specific requirements of PKBalpha for thymic development.  Keywords: Genetic modification Early thymocyte subsets (DN3 and ISP8) were sorted by FACS from 4 PKBalpha-/- / PKBalpha+/+ mouse littermate pairs. The same number of DN3 or ISP8 cells was sorted (7 000 to 25 000 cells) within a PKBalpha-/- / PKBalpha+/+ pair. Four replicates per condition were then analysed (4xPKBalpha-/- DN3, 4xPKBalpha+/+ DN3, 4xPKBalpha-/- ISP8, 4xPKBalpha+/+ ISP8).

Meiotic progression can also be triggered without sperm, as in parthenogenesis, although the classic mouse in vivo parthenogenetic model, LT/Sv, fails in meiosis I due to an unknown molecular etiology.  We here dissect PLCZ1 specificity and function in vivo and address its ability to interfere with maternal meiotic exit.  Wild-type mouse Plcz1 expression was restricted to post-pubertal testes, and the brains of both sexes, with region-specifying elements mapping to a 4.1 kb Plcz1 promoter fragment.  When broad ectopic PLCZ1 expression was forced in independent transgenic lines, they initially appeared healthy.  Their oocytes underwent unperturbed meiotic maturation to mII but subsequently exhibited autonomous intracellular free calcium oscillations, second polar body extrusion, pronucleus formation and parthenogenetic development.  Transfer of transgenic cumulus cell nuclei into wild-type oocytes induced activation and development, demonstrating a direct effect of PLCZ1 analogous to fertilization.  Whilst Plcz1 transgenic males remained largely asymptomatic, females developed abdominal swellings caused by benign ovarian teratomas that were under-represented for paternally- and placentally-expressed transcripts.  Plcz1 was not over-expressed in the ovaries of LT/Sv or in human germline ovarian tumours.  The narrow spectrum of PLCZ1 activity indicates that it is modulated by tissue-restricted accessory factors.  This work characterizes a novel model in which parthenogenesis and tumourigenesis follow full meiotic maturation and are linked to fertilization by PLCZ1.

In this study, we identify an integrated gene signature from multiple transgenic models of epithelial cancers intrinsic to the functions of the Simean virus 40 T/t-antigens that is associated with the biologic behavior and prognosis for several human epithelial tumors.  This genetic signature, composed primarily of genes regulating cell replication, proliferation, DNA repair and apoptosis, is not a general cancer signature. Rather, it is uniquely activated primarily in tumors with aberrant p53, Rb or BRCA1 expression, but not in tumors initiated through the overexpression of myc, ras, her2/neu, or Polyoma middle T oncogenes.  Importantly, human breast, lung and prostate tumors expressing this set of genes represent subsets of tumors with the most aggressive phenotype and with poor prognosis.  The T/t-antigen signature is highly predictive of  human breast cancer prognosis.  Since this class of epithelial tumors is generally intractable to currently existing standard therapies, this genetic signature identifies potential targets for novel therapies directed against these lethal forms of cancer.  Since the these genetic targets have been discovered using mammary, prostate, and lung T/t-antigen mouse cancer models, these models are rationale candidates for use in pre-clinical testing of therapies focused on these biologically important targets. Keywords: Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of cancer, epithelial carcinoma, SV40 T/t-antigen, survival predictor Gene expression profiles from the SV40 T/t-antigen mouse models were compared with respect to specimen type (normal vs. tumor tissue), location of tumor (mammary, lung, prostate, seminal vesicle), and background strain of mice (FVB vs. C57BL/6). A three-way ANOVA model with one interaction effect (type X location) was fitted. Cancer genes that differ among all four tumor locations were identified, as those that had a significant interaction effect at the 0.001 level and showed at least a 2-fold change between the maximal and minimal mean tumor/normal ratio over the different locations (2638 cDNA probes). Based on the ANOVA model, differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor specimens within each tumor location were also identified, as those genes whose expression were significant at the 0.001 level and were at least 2-fold different compared to the mean expression ratio. Overall 3004 unique array features were selected using ANOVA. Further selection was applied based upon identification of differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor tissue for the three epithelial tumors (mammary, lung and prostate). The SV40 T/t-antigen oncogene-specific signature included genes similarly differentially expressed in each epithelial tumor (153 cDNA clones). In contrast, genes were included in a tissue-specific SV40 T/t-antigen tumor signature if they were found to be differentially expressed between the tumor and normal samples exclusively for one location. Two-hundred and eighty three, 220 and 999 cDNA clones were identified as specifically dysregulated in mammary, lung and prostate tumors, respectively). ..

As a step in this direction, we have utilized gene profiling of a bipotential liver cell line from dpc 14 mouse embryonic liver to catalog genes expressed by liver progenitor cells.  These cells, known as Bipotential Mouse Embryonic Liver (BMEL) cells, proliferate in an undifferentiated state and are capable of differentiating into hepatocyte-like and cholangiocyte-like cells in vitro.  Upon transplantation, BMEL cells are capable of differentiating into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in vivo.  Microarray analysis of gene expression in the 9A1 and 14B3 BMEL cell lines grown under proliferating and differentiating conditions was used to identify cell surface markers preferentially expressed in the bipotential undifferentiated state.  This analysis revealed that proliferating BMEL cells express many genes involved in cell cycle regulation whereas differentiation of BMEL cells by cell aggregation causes a switch in gene expression to functions characteristic of mature hepatocytes.  In addition, microarray data and protein analysis indicated that the Notch signaling pathway could be involved in maintaining BMEL cells in an undifferentiated stem cell state.  Using GO annotation, a list of cell surface markers preferentially expressed on undifferentiated BMEL cells was generated.  One marker, Cd24a, is specifically expressed on progenitor oval cells in livers of DDC treated animals.  We therefore consider Cd24a expression a candidate molecule for purification of hepatic progenitor cells.

In XX sex-reversed males such as XX/Sry-transgenic (XX/Sry) mice, however, testicular germ cells always disappear soon after birth due to germ cell autonomous defects.  Therefore, it remains unclear whether or not Sry alone is sufficient to induce a fully functional testicular soma capable of supporting complete spermatogenesis in the XX body.  Here we demonstrated that the testicular somatic environment of XX/Sry males is defective in the later phases of spermatogenesis.  Spermatogonial transplantation analyses using XX/Sry male mice revealed that donor XY spermatogonia are capable of proliferating, entering meiosis and differentiating into the round spermatid stage.  XY donor-derived round spermatids, however, were frequently detached from the XX/Sry seminiferous epithelia and underwent cell death, thereby preventing further progress beyond the elongated spermatid stage.  In contrast, immature XY seminiferous tubule segments transplanted under XX/Sry testis capsules clearly displayed proper differentiation into elongated spermatids in the transplanted XY donor tubules.  Microarray analysis of seminiferous tubules isolated from XX/Sry testes confirmed missing expression of several Y-linked genes and alterations in the expression profile of genes associated with spermatogenesis.  Therefore, our findings indicate dysfunction of the somatic tubule components, probably Sertoli cells, of XX/Sry testes, supporting our hypothesis that Sry alone is insufficient to induce a fully functional Sertoli cell in XX mice. Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization Whole testes and seminiferous tubules of XX/Sry and W/Wv males were used for microarray expression analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip system (Affymetrix, CA).  In order to isolate the seminiferous tubules, the tunica was carefully removed from the testes which were then incubated in the medium with 5 mg/ml collagnease at 37oC for 40 min.  The remaining seminiferous tubules were washed several times with PBS using a 70-  m cell strainer to remove interstitial cells.  After total RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), double-stranded cDNA and biotin-labeled cRNA were synthesized using One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis and IVT Labeling kits (Affymetrix, CA), respectively.

However little is known about the effects of electro gene transfer on muscle fibres. We have therefore investigated transcriptional changes through gene expression profile analyses, as well as morphological changes evaluated by histological analysis. Electro gene transfer was obtained using a combination of a short high voltage pulse (HV, 1000 V/cm, 100 @s) followed by a long low voltage pulse (LV, 100 V/cm, 400 ms); a pulse combination optimised for efficient and safe gene transfer. Muscles were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and excised at 4 hours, 48 hours or 3 weeks after treatment. Results: Differentially expressed genes were investigated by microarray analysis, and descriptive statistics were performed to evaluate the effects of 1) electroporation, 2) DNA injection, and 3) time after treatment. The biological significance of the results was assessed by gene annotation and supervised cluster analysis. Generally, electroporation caused down-regulation of structural proteins e.g. sarcospan and catalytic en-zymes such as phosphoenolpuryvate carboxykinase. Injection of DNA induced down-regulation of intracellular transport proteins e.g. sentrin. The effects on muscle fibres were transient as the expression profiles 3 weeks after treatment were closely related with the control muscles. Most interestingly, no changes in the expression of proteins involved in inflammatory responses or muscle regeneration was detected, indicating limited muscle damage and regeneration. Histological analysis revealed structural changes with loss of cell integrity and striation pattern in some fibres after DNA+HV+LV treatment, while electroporation alone caused minor loss of striation pattern but preservation of cell integrity. Conclusion: The small and transient changes found in the gene expression profiles are of great importance, as this demonstrates that electro gene transfer is safe with minor effects on the muscle host cells. These findings are essential for introducing the electro gene transfer to muscle for clinical use. Indeed the HV+LV pulse combination used have been optimised to ensure highly efficient and safe electro gene transfer.

Little is known about the role of PPAR   in the small intestine. Since this organ is frequently exposed to high levels of PPAR   ligands via the diet, we set out to characterize the function of PPAR   in small intestine using functional genomics experiments and bioinformatics tools. PPAR   was expressed at high levels in both human and murine small intestine. Detailed analyses showed that PPAR   was expressed highest in villus cells of proximal jejunum. Microarray analyses of total tissue samples revealed, that in addition to genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglycerol metabolism, transcription factors and enzymes connected to sterol and bile acid metabolism, including FXR and SREBP1, were specifically induced. In contrast, genes involved in cell cycle and differentiation, apoptosis, and host defense were repressed by PPAR   activation. Additional analyses showed that intestinal PPAR   dependent gene regulation occurred in villus cells. Functional implications of array results were corroborated by morphometric data. The repression of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis was accompanied by a 22% increase in villus height, and a 34% increase in villus area of wild-type animals treated with WY14643. This is the first report providing a comprehensive overview of processes under control of PPAR   in the small intestine. We show that PPAR   is an important transcriptional regulator in small intestine, which may be of importance for the development of novel foods and therapies for obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases.

In this study, mice were immunized by iv injection using either high toxicity lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or low toxicity monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) as adjuvant.  Six hours after iv immunization, whole spleens were harvested and gene expression was measured in unfractionated splenic populations of cells.  The analysis indicated that the low toxicity adjuvanticity of MPL was associated with TLR4-mediated signaling that was biased to the TRIF branch of TLR4, while LPS generated balanced MyD88 and TRIF-associated outcomes.

MTf is expressed at very low levels in normal tissues and in high amounts in melanoma cells. The over-expression of MTf in tumor cells was hypothesized to assist rapidly proliferating neoplastic cells with their increased Fe requirements. However, our recent   characterization of the MTf knockout (MTf -/-) mouse demonstrated that MTf did not have an essential role in Fe metabolism. To understand the function of MTf, we utilized whole-genome microarray analysis to examine the gene expression profile of five models after modulating MTf expression. These models included two new stably transfected MTf hyper-expression models (SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma and LMTK- fibroblasts) and one cell type (SK-Mel-28 melanoma) where MTf was down-regulated by post-transcriptional gene silencing. These findings were compared to alterations in gene expression identified using the MTf -/- mouse. In addition, the changes identified from the gene array data were also assessed in a new model of MTf down-regulation in SK-Mel-2 melanoma cells. In the cell line models, MTf hyper-expression led to increased cellular proliferation, while MTf down-regulation resulted in decreased proliferation. Across all five models of MTf down- and up-regulation, we identified three genes modulated by MTf expression. These included ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 5 (Abcb5), whose change in expression mirrored MTf down- or up-regulation. In addition, thiamine triphosphatase (Thtpa) and transcription factor 4 (Tcf4) were inversely expressed relative to MTf levels across all five models. The products of these three genes are involved in membrane transport, thiamine phosphorylation and cell proliferation/survival, respectively. This study identifies novel molecular targets directly or indirectly regulated by MTf and potential pathways involved in its function. These molecular targets could be involved, at least in part, to the role of MTf in modulating proliferation.  Keywords: Melanotransferrin, hyperexpression cell lines, comparative genomic hybridization Hyper-expression constructs of the mouse MTf cDNA was generated using the pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI) expression vector.

Comparision with the other cell types in the olfactory epithelium should eliminate the transcripts commonly expressed in the olfactory epithelium and comparision with brain will eliminate the transcripts common to most neurons. Our gene chip data indicates that mature mouse olfactory sensory neurons express 10,000 genes. Mature OSNs specifically contained three clusters of over represented Gene ontology categories: smell, ion transport and cilia.

It is unclear whether the self-renewal of pluripotent embryonic SC (ESC) and of tissue-specific adult SC such as hematopoietic SC (HSC) is controlled by common mechanisms. The deletion of transcription factor Zfx impaired the self-renewal but not the differentiation capacity of murine ESC; conversely, Zfx overexpression facilitated ESC self-renewal by opposing differentiation. Furthermore, Zfx deletion abolished the maintenance of adult bone marrow HSC, but did not affect erythromyeloid progenitors or fetal HSC. In both ESC and HSC, Zfx activated a common set of direct target genes. In addition, the loss of Zfx resulted in the induction of immediate-early and/or stress-inducible genes in both SC types but not in their differentiated progeny. These studies identify the first shared transcriptional regulator of ESC and HSC, suggesting a common molecular basis of self-renewal in embryonic and adult SC.

The data presented herein demonstrate that DMXAA is a novel and specific activator of the TBK1-IRF-3 signaling pathway.  DMXAA treatment of primary murine macrophages resulted in robust IRF-3 activation, a ~750-fold increase in IFN-beta mRNA and, in contrast to the potent Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), signaling was independent of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and elicited minimal NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression.  DMXAA-induced signaling was critically dependent on the IRF-3 kinase, TBK1, and IRF-3, but MyD88-, TRIF-, IPS-1/MAVS-, and IKKbeta-independent, thus excluding all known TLRs and cytosolic helicase receptors.  DMXAA pretreatment of murine macrophages induced a state of tolerance to LPS and vice versa.  In contrast to LPS stimulation, DMXAA-induced IRF-3 dimerization and IFN-beta expression were inhibited by salicylic acid (SA).

A constant feature of childhood adrenocortical tumors (ACT) is SF-1 amplification and overexpression. Using an inducible cellular system, here we show that SF-1 overexpression increases human adrenocortical cell proliferation through opposing effects on cell cycle and apoptosis. SF-1 overexpression also selectively modulates steroidogenesis, reducing cortisol and aldosterone secretion. We identified a novel pro-apoptotic factor for adrenocortical cells, NOV/CCN3, whose levels are significantly reduced by SF-1 overexpression in human adrenocortical cells and are also reduced in primary adrenal tumors. Moreover, Sf-1 overexpression triggers adrenocortical hyperplasia and tumor formation in mice. These tumors express gonadal markers and activated Stat3. Our studies reveal the critical role of SF-1 gene dosage for adrenocortical tumorigenesis and constitute a rationale for the development of drugs targeting SF-1 transcriptional activity for ACT therapy.

The current therapeutic approaches for treating muscle injuries are dependent on the clinical severity but not on the type of injury.  The aim of this study was to compare the molecular events accompanying the degeneration and repair phases of contraction- and trauma-induced muscle injuries by applying DNA microarray methodology to two well-characterized mouse models of skeletal muscle injury, i.e., eccentric contraction-induced injury (CI) and traumatic injury induced by freezing (FI).  Histopathological evaluation and measurements of muscle strength were accompanied by analyses of expression for 12,488 known genes at four time points ranging from 6 hours to 7 days post-injury.  Real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm some of the gene expression temporal profiles.  While both types of injury cause early induction of transcription, myogenic, and stress-responsive factors, they also induce injury type-specific gene expression profiles.  CI only activates a set of genes associated with the protection and repair of protein and structural integrity while FI activates gene sets which result in extensive inflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and myofibre and extracellular matrix synthesis.  This study identified genes that are candidates for therapeutic manipulation following two disparate types of muscle injury.

NRAS mutation leads to increased cellular proliferation and is potently tumorigenic. In contrast, KRAS mutation does not enhance melanocyte proliferation and is only weakly tumorigenic on its own. While both NRAS and KRAS activate MAPK signaling, only NRAS enhances MYC activity in these cells.

The following abstract from the published manuscript describes the major findings of this work.  A potential link between muscle peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-alpha signaling and obesity-related diabetes.Finck BN, Bernal-Mizrachi C, Han DH, Coleman T, Sambandam N, LaRiviere LL, Holloszy JO, Semenkovich CF, Kelly DP.   The role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) in the development of insulin-resistant diabetes was evaluated using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Transgenic mice overexpressing PPARalpha in muscle (MCK-PPARalpha mice) developed glucose intolerance despite being protected from diet-induced obesity. Conversely, PPARalpha null mice were protected from diet-induced insulin resistance in the context of obesity. In skeletal muscle, MCK-PPARalpha mice exhibited increased fatty acid oxidation rates, diminished AMP-activated protein kinase activity, and reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake without alterations in the phosphorylation status of key insulin-signaling proteins. These effects on muscle glucose uptake involved transcriptional repression of the GLUT4 gene. Pharmacologic inhibition of fatty acid oxidation or mitochondrial respiratory coupling prevented the effects of PPARalpha on GLUT4 expression and glucose homeostasis. These results identify PPARalpha-driven alterations in muscle fatty acid oxidation and energetics as a potential link between obesity and the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.

Recently, we found antiinflammatory effect of orally administered LPO in mouse model of influenza virus-induced pneumonia. In order to study influence of bovine LPO on the digestive tract as its possible target organ, we performed comprehensive gene expression analysis of the mouse small intestine using GeneChip microarray to compare the effect of LPO with that of water or bovine serum albumin (BSA). We observed that 3 h after single ingestion of LPO the levels of 78 gene expression are upregulated and those of 9 gene expressions are downregulated. Within most changed genes, 5 upregulated and 1 downregulated genes such as FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK) are known to be transcriptionally modulated by glucocorticoid. This result suggests that ingested LPO modulates gene expressions in the small intestine in a glucocorticoid-like manner and this activity may link to its systemic antiinflammatory effects.

The bioassays involved are expensive and time-consuming, requiring nearly lifetime exposures (two years) in mice and rats and costing $2 to $4 million per chemical. Since there are approximately 80,000 chemicals registered for commercial use in the United States and 2,000 more are added each year, applying animal bioassays to all chemicals of concern is clearly impossible. To efficiently and economically identify carcinogens prior to widespread use and human exposure, alternatives to the two-year rodent bioassay must be developed. In this study, animals were exposed for 13 weeks to two chemicals that were positive for liver tumors in the two-year rodent bioassay, two chemicals that were negative for liver tumors, and two vehicle controls.  Gene expression analysis was performed on the livers of the animals to assess the potential for identifying gene expression biomarkers that can predict tumor formation in a two-year bioassay following a 13 week exposure.

In cultured cardiac cardiomyocytes, the transcription factor Gata4 is required for agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We hypothesized that in the intact organism Gata4 is an important regulator of postnatal heart function and of the hypertrophic response of the heart to pathological stress. To test this hypothesis, we studied mice heterozygous for deletion of the second exon of Gata4 (G4D). At baseline, G4D mice had mild systolic and diastolic dysfunction associated with reduced heart weight and decreased cardiomyocyte number. After transverse aortic constriction (TAC), G4D mice developed overt heart failure and eccentric cardiac hypertrophy, associated with significantly increased fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of apoptosis by overexpression of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor prevented TAC-induced heart failure in G4D mice. Unlike WT-TAC controls, G4D-TAC cardiomyocytes hypertrophied by increasing in length more than width. Gene expression profiling revealed upregulation of genes associated with apoptosis and fibrosis, including members of the TGF? pathway. Our data demonstrate that Gata4 is essential for cardiac function in the postnatal heart. After pressure overload, Gata4 regulates the pattern of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and protects the heart from load-induced failure. Keywords: genetic modification, pressure overload stress response We reasoned that if Gata4 was a crucial regulator of pathways necessary for cardiac hypertrophy, then modest reductions of Gata4 activity should result in an observable cardiac phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we used gene targeted mice that express reduced levels of Gata4. We characterized these mice at baseline and after pressureoverload. ..

In particular, glucocorticoid treatment induces massive apoptosis of CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes. This effect is due to many mechanisms, mainly driven by modulation of gene transcription. To find out which genes are modulated, we analyzed DP thymocytes treated for 3 hours with dexamethasone or medium alone, by global gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix technology (MGU74Av2 GeneChip). The data were analyzed with MAS 5.0  imposing a cut off of 1.7 fold in up regulation and 1.35 fold in down regulation. To further filter results we also used the statistical software, SAM (d 0.88 see figure 1s in supplementary data of the above cited manuscript). Results indicate modulation of 156 genes, also confirmed by either RNAse protection assay or Real Time PCR. For data mining we also used Go Miner to explore the Gene Ontology data bank (see tables 1-3 of the above cited manuscript). The overall results demonstrated that dexamethasone caused the down-regulation of genes promoting survival of DP thymocytes (e.g. Notch1, Socs1 and Id3) or the modulation of genes activating cell death through the ceramide pathway (Ugcg, Sgpp1, Degs1 and Gpr65) or through the mithocondrial machinery. Among the latter, there are Bcl-2 family members (Bim, Bfl-1, Bcl-xL and Bcl-xbeta), genes involved in the control of redox status (thioredoxin reductase, TXNIP and idh2) and genes belonging to Tis11 family which are involved in mRNA stability. Our study suggests that dexamethasone treatment of DP thymocytes modulates several genes belonging to apoptosis-related systems that can contribute to their apoptosis.  Keywords: Dexamethasone/PBS treatment comparison Thymi from 4 week old C3H/HeN mice were teased in culture medium, CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes were sorted with microbeads Miltenyi Biotech methods and were plated in 6 well plates with 3 ml of the culture medium at a concentration of 5.0E+06 cell/ml together with 1E-07 M Dexamethasone or a corresponding volume of PBS.

To better characterize MG-SPs, their microarray gene profiles were compared to the remaining cells, which retain Hoechst dye (MG-NSPs). For analysis, gene ontology (GO) that describes genes in terms of biological processes and ontology traverser (OT) that performs enrichment analysis were utilized.  OT showed that MG-SP specific genes were enriched in the GO categories of cell cycle regulation and checkpoints, multi-drug resistant transporters, organogenesis, and vasculogenesis.  The MG-NSP upregulated genes were enriched in the GO category of cellular organization and biogenesis which includes basal epithelial markers, p63, smooth muscle actin (SMA), myosin, alpha-6 integrin, cytokeratin (CK) 14, as well as luminal markers, CK8 and CD24.  Additional studies showed that a higher percentage of MG-SPs exist in the G1 phase of the cell cycle compared to the MG-NSPs.  G1 cell cycle block of MG-SPs may be explained by higher expression of cell cycle negative regulatory genes such as TGF-beta2 (transforming growth factor-beta2), IGFBP-5 (insulin like growth factor binding protein-5), P18 INK4C and Wnt-5a (wingless-5a). Accordingly, a smaller percentage of MG-SPs expressed nuclear b-catenin, possibly as a consequence of the higher expression of Wnt-5a.  In conclusion, microarray gene profiling suggests that MG-SPs are a lineage deficient mammary gland sub-population expressing key genes involved in cell cycle regulation, development and angiogenesis.  Supplemental File Descriptions:  Table 1 is a list of 1632 Genes differentially expressed by MG-SP and MG-NSP; Criteria for comparison included 1.2-fold difference in expression levels, false discovery rate (FDR) 9.4%, P value less than 0.05.

Keywords: Normal C57BL/6 Mammary Gland Epithelial Cells Gene expression profiles were obtained by hybridizing amplified RNA from four replicate MG-SP and MG-NSP samples to Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray chips. To isolate MG-SP and MG-NSPs, mammary gland cells were stained using the Hoechst dye 33342 and fluorescence displayed at two wavelength emissions, blue and red.  The MG-SP and MG-NSP regions were indicated by trapezoids on the left (R1) and right (R2), respectively.  We and others have previously shown that the R1 region is composed of side population cells since verapamil blocks their appearance.  The cells in each region (R1 and R2) were sorted, their RNA isolated and amplified by two rounds of in vitro amplification and applied to Affymetrix chips.  Hybridization, scanning, and production of raw data files were performed according to the Affymetrix standard protocols. Normalization and model-based expression measurements were performed with dChip. Two of the chips were eliminated from further analysis due to the high percentage of probe sets called an array outlier after model based expression analysis by dChip (Not included).  The genes were filtered to eliminate those with very low expression values in most samples.  From 45,000 probe sets, 16,744 probe sets were retained and used for further analysis.  For normalization purposes and to allow for data comparison with other centers, universal mouse reference RNA (Stratagene) was hybridized to two chips. All other arrays were normalized to one of the universal mouse reference RNA arrays expressing average intensity closest to the median intensity of all chips (Stratagene Ref 2). ..

For three regions of the left ventricle (LV), namely ischemic/infarcted tissue (IF), the surviving LV free wall (FW) and the interventricular septum (IVS), 36,899 transcripts were assayed at six time points from 15 min to 48 h post-AMI in both AMI and sham surgery mice. For each transcript, temporal expression patterns were systematically compared between AMI and sham groups, which identified 515 AMI-responsive genes in IF tissue, 35 in the FW, 7 in the IVS, with three genes induced in all three regions. Using the literature, we assigned functional annotations to all 519 nonredundant AMI-induced genes and present two testable models for central signaling pathways induced early post-AMI.  First, the early induction of 15 genes involved in assembly and activation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors implicates AP-1 as a dominant regulator of earliest post-ischemic molecular events.  Second, dramatic increases in transcripts for arginase 1 (ARG1), the enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis and protein inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity indicates that NO production may be regulated, in part, by inhibition of NOS and coordinate depletion of the NOS substrate, L-arginine. ARG1 was the single most highly induced transcript in the database (121-fold in IF region) and its induction in heart has not been previously reported.   Keywords: heart attack, mouse, time course, regional responses We report temporal and regional changes in steady state mRNA levels in the mouse LV following a surgically-induced AMI.  Three regions of the infarcted LV were surveyed: IF, FW and IVS.  For each region, mRNA levels were assayed at t=0 and six time points after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (t = 15 min, 1 h, 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h).  As control, an identical time course was carried out in the mouse LV after sham surgery in which the suture was passed under the artery, but not ligated.  For sham surgical mice and na  ve mice (t=0), the IVS and the LV free wall were harvested and assayed.  The AMI and sham time courses were repeated for a total of two independent repetitions of the experiment.  For each repetition, 96 GeneChips were hybridized.  Thus, for two repetitions, 192 GeneChips (2 x 96) were hybridized.  In addition, the na  ve time point was assayed a second time during Repetition 1 for six additional GeneChips (two tissues x three chips).  The overall total number of samples is 198 GeneChips (192 + 6).   Total RNA was isolated from each individual tissue sample.  Equal weights of total RNA from 4-10 mice were combined for each LV region, time point and treatment.  Copy RNA mixtures were synthesized from each total RNA pool and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip set MG U74 v2 (A, B, and C) that carries 36,899 probe sets.  The global normalization of fluorescence emissions for the 198 GeneChips used in this study and their conversion to relative transcript concentrations measured in relative fluorescence units (RFU) was conducted using Robust Multi-array Averaging (RMA; www.bioconductor.org).

To investigate their specific roles in brown fat cells, we generated immortal preadipocyte lines from the brown adipose tissue of mice lacking PGC-1  . We could then efficiently knockdown PGC-1   expression by shRNA expression. Loss of PGC-1   did not alter brown fat differentiation but severely reduced the induction of thermogenic genes. Cells deficient in either PGC-1   or PGC-1   coactivators showed a small decrease in the differentiation-dependant program of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration; however, this increase in mitochondrial number and function was totally abolished during brown fat differentiation when both PGC-1   and PGC-1   were deficient. These data show that PGC-1   is essential for brown fat thermogenesis but not brown fat differentiation, and the PGC-1 coactivators play an absolutely essential but complementary function in differentiation-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Affymetrix microarray analysis of total RNA from wt, PGC-1   KO and PGC-1   KO cells expressing an RNAi specific for PGC-1   knockdown was performed. Of the 461 mitochondrial genes analyzed, 181 were found to be at least 20% different between wt and defective PGC-1   and    adipocytes (p < 0.05). More than 85% of these genes were downregulated in cells deficient for PGC-1alpha and PGC-1beta.

We could then efficiently knockdown PGC-1beta expression by shRNA expression. Loss of PGC-1alpha did not alter brown fat differentiation but severly reduced the induction of thermogenic genes. In order to assess the specific requirement for PGC-1   in the global transcriptional response to cAMP, we used Affymetrix arrays to compare the sets of genes induced in response to a 4 hr dbcAMP treatment in differentiated wt and KO cells. This analysis revealed that 88 genes were induced more than 3-fold in the wt cells; of these, 54 (61% of total) were similarly increased in both wt and KO. However, 28 genes (32% of total) were decreased by at least 50% in the KO cells compared to wt cells. These data were confirmed by quantitative PCR for a subset of genes. These data indicate that PGC-1   is required for proper expression of approximately one third of the genes induced in response to cAMP in brown fat cells, but this set of sensitive genes is enriched in those involved in adaptative thermogenesis.

To further explore this issue, we performed a series of superficial and transmural myocardial injuries in C57BL/6 and MRL/MpJ adult mice.  At defined time intervals following the respective injury (Days 3, 14, 30 and 60) we examined cardiac function using echocardiography, morphology, FACS cell sorting for BrdU positive cells and molecular signature using microarray analysis.  We observed complete restoration of myocardial function in the superficial MRL cryoinjured heart and significantly less scar formation as compared to the injured hearts of C57BL/6 mice.  Following a severe transmural myocardial injury, the MRL mouse has increased survival and decreased ventricular remodeling compared to the C57BL/6 mouse but without evidence of significant regeneration.  The cytoprotective program observed in the severely injured MRL heart is in part due to increased vasculogenesis and decreased apoptosis that limits the extension of the injury.  We conclude that C57BL/6 and MRL injured hearts have evidence of limited myocardial regeneration, in response to superficial injury, but the improved function and survival observed in the MRL mouse heart following severe injury is not due to significant regenerative processes.

Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.

Gene Ontology (GO)analysis was used to characterize differences in expression between G93A-SOD1 mouse and nontransgenic mouse spinal cord. Changes in multiple GO categories were found.  Many of these were associated with subsystems involving cell-cell communication and intracellular signal transduction.  Expression profiles of mice expressing WT-SOD1 did not differ from nontransgenic mice.  In contrast, protein profiling using proteomics technology indicated changes in mitochondrial protein expression in the G93A-SOD1 mouse spinal cord that were not found in the mRNA expression analysis.

It has been identified as one of the mediators of renal hypertrophy and accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins in the diabetic glomerular mesangium. Previous results from our and other laboratories indicate that TGF-beta1 mediates some of the effects of high glucose and glucosamine on extracellular matrix gene expression in mesangial cells. The global regulatory mechanism(s), however, still remains to be understood.  In this study, we have utilized an in vitro model of mouse mesangial cells (MES-13) to investigate the genetic effects of TGF-beta1 on global patterns of gene expression, transcriptome and signaling networks. A total number of 179 genes are regulated by TGF-beta1 in MES-13 cells at 2.0-fold, which cover across 44 physiological processes, 31 metabolic functions, and 11 major signaling pathways. We observed that several genes regulated by high glucose and glucosamine are also targeted by TGF-beta1 in MES-13 cells such as thioredoxin interacting protein, glutathione S-transferase theta 1, selenium binding protein 1, inhibitor of DNA binding 2, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The results of this study further support the hypothesis that some effects of high glucose and glucosamine on mesangial gene expression are mediated by TGF-beta1. The identification of these common genes will help us to investigate further their roles in the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease.        Cell culture: Stable murine mesangial (MES-13) cells transformed with non-capsid-forming SV-40 virus were obtained from the ATCC, Manassas, VA. These cells display a differentiated mesangial cell phenotype including the typical spindle-like appearance, positive staining for vimentin and desmin, and contraction in response to ANG II and expression of AT1 receptor. The cells were maintained in DMEM and F-12 Nutrient Mixture (Ham's) (4:1 ratio) (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) containing a normal D-glucose concentration of 5.5 mmol/L, 2% FCS, 100   g/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine (26). The cells were incubated in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2 at 37   C and routinely passaged at confluence every 3 days by trypsinization using 10-cm culture dishes. Approximately 50% confluent monolayers were starved in the above medium without FCS for 1 day and then incubated in the starvation medium with 100 ng/ml TGF-beta1 for 24hrs.        Total RNA isolation, cDNA and cRNA synthesis and genechip hybridization: Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Massachusetts). cDNA and cRNA synthesis, genechip hybridization, and scanning of the Affymetrix murine expression U430 2.0 chips (the Affymetrix M430 2.0 chip contains 39,000 transcripts targeted at 34,000 well characterized genes) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 5 mg of RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA by reverse transcription using a cDNA synthesis kit (SuperScript Choice, Life Technologies, Inc., MA) with an oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site added 3' of the poly(T) (Genset, La Jolla, CA). After second-strand synthesis, labeled cRNA was generated from the cDNA sample by an in vitro transcription reaction supplemented with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). The labeled cRNA was purified by using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 15 mg of each cRNA was fragmented at 94   C for 35 min in fragmentation buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM magnesium acetate) and then used to prepare 300 ml of hybridization mixture (100 mM MES, 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA (Promega), 1M sodium chloride, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.005% Triton X-100) containing a mixture of control cRNAs samples were heated at 94   C for 5 min, equilibrated at 45   C for 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation (14,000 x g) at room temperature for 5 min. Aliquots of each sample (10 mg of cRNA in 200 ml of the master mix) were hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array at 45   C for 16 h in a rotisserie oven set at 60 rpm, then washed with non stringent wash buffer (6x saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA) at 25   C, followed by stringent wash buffer (100 mM MES (pH 6.7), 0.1 M NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) at 50   C, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probe), washed again with 6x saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, stained with biotinylated anti-streptavidin lgG, followed by a second staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and a third washing with 6x saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA using the GeneChip Fluidics Station 450. The arrays were then scanned using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). Each experiment was repeated twice.        Microarray Data analysis: The chips were read with Affymetrix GCOS v1.2, and the probe intensity files were modeled with DChip 1.3 (Harvard School of Public Health) in both PM-only and PM-MM modes. Consensus differentially regulated genes were initially derived from repeat experiments on the bases of a 90% CI of greater than 2-fold change in expression and with p<0.05 of error in paired t-test across repeats. This was further validated through modeling of variance between sample groups (one-way ANOVA) conducted in GeneSpring 6.0 (Silicon Genetix). The consensus gene-set was clustered in DChip and GeneSpring 6.0, with OntoExpress (Wayne State University) to explore ontological associations. Further ontological and pathway analyses were conducted with the GeneGo software and NIH's DAVID bioinformatics programs (heep://appls.niaid.nih.gov/david).

Numerous studies have implicated SRF as a central regulator of muscle gene expression and myogenesis. In this present study we used a loss of function approach to delineate the role of SRF in cardiac myocyte gene expression and function. In SRF null neonatal cardiomyocytes, we observe severe defects in the contractile apparatus, including Z-disc and stress fiber formation, as well as mislocalization and/or attenuation of sarcomeric proteins. Consistent with this, gene array and RT-PCR analyses show downregulation of genes encoding key cardiac transcriptional regulatory factors and proteins required for the maintenance of sarcomeric structure, function, and regulation. Chromatin IP analysis reveals that at least a subset of these proteins are likely regulated directly by SRF. Together the results presented here reveal new cellular and genetic mechanisms through which SRF exacts control over the contractile apparatus in cardiac myocytes.

Exposure to phosgene results in a latent (1-24 hr), potentially life-threatening pulmonary edema and irreversible acute lung injury.  A genomic approach was utilized to investigate the molecular mechanism of phosgene-induced lung injury.  CD-1 male mice were exposed whole-body to either air or a concentration x time (c x t) amount of 32 mg/m3 (8 ppm) phosgene for 20 min (640 mg x min/m3).  Lung tissue was collected from air- or phosgene-exposed mice at 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr post-exposure.  RNA was extracted from the lung and used as starting material for the probing of oligonucleotide microarrays to determine changes in gene expression following phosgene exposure.  The data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the greatest sources of data variability.  A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on exposure, time, and sample was performed to identify the genes most significantly changed as a result of phosgene exposure.  These genes were rank ordered by p-values and categorized based on molecular function and biological process.  Some of the most significant changes in gene expression reflect changes in glutathione synthesis and redox regulation of the cell, including upregulation of glutathione S-transferase alpha-2, glutathione peroxidase 2, and glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (also known as   -glutamyl cysteine synthetase).  This is in agreement with previous observations describing changes in redox enzyme activity after phosgene exposure.  We are also investigating other pathways that are responsive to phosgene exposure to identify mechanisms of toxicity and potential therapeutic targets.  Male CD-1 mice were exposed to air or 32 mg per cubic meter phosgene for 20 min and tissue collected at 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, or 72 hr before collection and analysis of lung tissue using oligonucleotide microarrays.

We have isolated and identified downstream gene targets of Brn-3.2, using Representational Difference Analysis (RDA), on cDNA populations derived from wildtype and Brn-3.2-/- retina at the appropriate embryonic stage. One of these candidate genes, the Homeodomain Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (HIPK2), is postulated to be a transcriptional coregulator, based on its in vitro interactions with repressor homeodomain proteins of the NK class, as well as other components of repressor complexes. HIPK2 has also been shown to be involved in post-translational modification of two major transcriptional regulators, p53 and CtBP. Expression of a dominant-negative form of HIPK2 in sensory neurons affects the innervation patterns of their target tissues, suggesting an axon pathfinding defect. The aim of this project is to identify targets for the Homeodomain Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (HIPK2), that we isolated as a downstream gene target of the class IV POU domain transcription factor Brn-3.2, and to investigate their function in the Brn-3.2 dependent pathway regulating axon pathfinding.  We hypothesize that the genes regulated by HIPK2 will play a critical role in axon pathfinding and that the results of this study will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of axon pathfinding, and possibly neural plasticity and regeneration, and therefore, be of great interest to the field of neurobiology in general. In order to uncover potential biological role(s) of HIPK2 in neural development, and particularly axon pathfinding, we generated transgenic mouse models for in vivo studies. Our preliminary observations in transgenic mice, indicate that a form of the molecule expected to act as a dominant-negative and designed to be expressed in sensory neurons, affects the innervation patterns of their target tissues, suggesting an axon pathfinding defect. We plan to take advantage of this model to identify genes regulated by HIPK2, and which are likely to be involved in axon pathfinding. To this end, we will compare gene expression profiles in sensory neurons isolated wild-type and transgenic mice. In our experimental paradigm, the trigeminal ganglion represents the ideal sensory structure in which to perform such an analysis: 1) High levels of transgene can be expressed in the trigeminal ganglion, as assessed by the expression of LacZ from the bicistronic construct which contains IRES-LacZ downstream of a dominant negative form of HIPK2.  2) The trigeminal ganglion can be dissected at embryonic day 13.5, when the phenotype is apparent, with ease and free of contamination from surrounding tissues.  3) The amounts of RNA that can be isolated from a single ganglion are in the range of 200-300 ng, which should be sufficient for microarray analysis following linear amplification of RNA. One series will be carried out with transgenic embryos and a control series will be carried out with wildtype littermates. Animals will be prepared and sacrificed by a standard protocol. Tissue will be rapidly dissected from E13.5 trigeminal ganglion, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80C until RNA is extracted. RNA will be prepared using RNeasy Micro Kit. We will be providing 4 tissue samples for each of the wildtype and transgenic animals to mitigate any expression differences resulting from mouse to mouse variation.

It is thought to result from transformation of granule cell precursors (GCPs) in the developing cerebellum, but little is known about the early stages of the disease. Here we identify a pre-neoplastic stage of medulloblastoma in patched heterozygous mice, a model of the human disease. We show that pre-neoplastic cells are present in the majority of patched mutants, although only 16% of these mice develop tumors. Pre-neoplastic cells, like tumor cells, exhibit activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway and constitutive proliferation. Importantly, they also lack expression of the wild-type patched allele, suggesting that loss of patched is an early event in tumorigenesis. While pre-neoplastic cells resemble GCPs and tumor cells in many respects, they have a distinct molecular signature. Genes that mark the pre-neoplastic stage include regulators of migration, apoptosis and differentiation, processes critical for normal development but previously unrecognized for their role in medulloblastoma. The identification and molecular characterization of pre-neoplastic cells provides insight into the early steps in medulloblastoma formation, and may yield important markers for early detection and therapy of this disease.  ANIMALS  Patched heterozygous mice (Goodrich et al., 1997) were obtained from Matthew Scott's lab at Stanford, and maintained by breeding with 129X1/SvJ mice from Jackson Laboratories. Math1-GFP transgenic mice (Lumpkin et al., 2003) were provided by Jane Johnson at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Math1-GFP/patched+/- mice were generated by crossing patched heterozygotes with Math1-GFP mice, and then backcrossing to Math1-GFP mice three times before further analysis. All mice were maintained in the Cancer Center Isolation Facility at Duke University Medical Center.  ISOLATION OF CELLS  Granule cell precursors (GCPs) were isolated from 7-day-old (P7) patched+/- mice; preneoplastic cells were obtained from 6 week-old patched mutants; and tumor cells were obtained from 10-25-week old patched mutants displaying physical and behavioral signs of medulloblastoma. Cells were isolated from each source using a protocol described in (Wechsler- Reya and Scott, 1999). Briefly, cerebella were digested in solution containing 10 U/ml papain Oliver et al. Pre-Neoplastic Stage of Medulloblastoma - 8 - (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) and 250 U/ml DNase (Sigma) and triturated to obtain a cell suspension. This suspension was centrifuged through a step gradient of 35% and 65% Percoll (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), and cells were harvested from the 35%-65% interface. Cells were resuspended in serum-free culture medium consisting of Neurobasal containing B27 supplement, sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) and counted on a hemacytometer. Cells used for RNA isolation were centrifuged and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. For proliferation assays or immunostaining, cells were plated on poly-D-lysine (PDL)-coated tissue culture vessels and incubated in serum-free culture medium.  MICROARRAY HYBRIDIZATION AND ANALYSIS  RNA from GCPs, pre-neoplastic cells and tumor cells (isolated as described above, but not FACS-sorted) and from normal adult cerebellum (not dissociated) was converted to cDNA using the Superscript Choice cDNA kit (Invitrogen) and a T7-dT(24) primer (Genset/Proligo, Boulder, CO). cRNA was generated using a T7-transcription/labeling kit from Enzo Life Sciences and hybridized to Affymetrix U74Av2 chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Chips were scanned, and hybridization data were acquired using Affymetrix Suite 5.0 software. Affymetrix CEL files were normalized and quantified using Bioconductor software with the gcRMA model to quantify gene expression levels (Gentleman and Carey, 2002). Unsupervised principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify the relationships among normal adult cerebellum, GCPs, pre-neoplastic cells and tumor cells based on expression profiles. To identify genes that were differentially expressed among GCPs, pre-neoplastic cells and tumor cells, supervised analysis was carried out. A gene-by-gene ANOVA model with three groups (GCP, pre-neoplastic, tumor) was used to fit the log2-transformed intensities. To correct for multiple comparisons, the nominal p-value was adjusted using the false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if they satisfied all of the following criteria: a difference in expression greater than 1.9-fold between any two groups, a maximum absolute intensity difference larger than 32 units, and an adjusted pvalue < 0.01. There were 118 genes that met these criteria. The identities of differentially expressed genes were verified by integrating data from the Affymetrix and Unigene databases. Gene functions were determined using information from Gene Ontology, Unigene, LocusLink and PubMed databases. Clustering was performed with Cluster and Treeview (Eisen et al., 1998). All statistical analysis was performed using R-1.7 software (Dalgaard, 2002). Results were visualized with Spotfire 6.0 (Somerville, MA).  CORRESPONDING AUTHOR  Robert J.

Animals had free access to tap water and food pellets (R36, Labfor, Stockholm, Sweden). Animals were randomly divided into healthy and diabetic groups. The diabetic group received a single peritoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, Sigma-Aldrich, France, 180 mg/kg) dissolved in sodium citrate buffer solution (0.1 mol/l, pH 4.5) to induce experimental diabetes similar to type 1. The other group received injection of an equal volume of buffer. Diabetes was confirmed 72 hours after the injection by urine glucose testing (Glukotest(r), Roche, Germany), and mice were characterized diabetic when urine glucose values were greater than 200 mg/dl. Diabetic and healthy animals were randomly assigned into 12 groups (n = 5 per group), which were sedentary or trained for one, three or five weeks. Training groups performed 1 hour per day of treadmill running at 21 m/min and 2.5   incline. After one day of familiarization on a rodent treadmill, the mice ran as described above 5 days per week. Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last training bout (respective sedentary controls at the same time) by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. Calf muscles were removed, dissected free of fat and connective tissue, weighed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80  C for further analysis.   Total RNA extraction and sample preparation:   Total RNA was extracted from the left calf muscle complex (soleus + gastrocnemius + plantaris) with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and further purified with RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Concentration and purity of RNA was determined by measuring absorbances at wavelengths 260 and 280 nm. Integrity of the RNA was checked with agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA samples were pooled within each group for microarray analyses. Concentration, purity and integrity of pooled RNA samples were checked as described above.   Micro array analysis:   Pooled RNA samples were analyzed with Affymetrix Gene Chip MG U74Av2 (Affymetrix , Inc., Santa Clara, CA) representing 6000 known genes and 6000 ESTs. Microarray analyses were performed according to the instructions of Affymetrix. Briefly, 5   g of total pooled RNA was reverse transcribed using T7-(dT)24-primers and SuperScript II RT enzyme (Invitrogen). Single stranded cDNA was turned to double stranded cDNA using T4 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Produced cDNA was then purified and transcribed in vitro to biotin labeled cRNA using Enzo Bioarray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). RNA was purified and its quality was checked. Purity and quantity of RNA was measured with Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Montchanin, DE) and integrity was tested with agarose gel electrophoresis. Sample was then fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix test chip to check the function of the hybridization cocktail and to ensure adequate representation of both 5  and 3  ends of the RNA. After testing, samples (15   g) were hybridized to expression chips. After hybridization, chips were washed and stained in Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400. Arrays were stained first with R-Phycoerythrin Streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), then with biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and again with R-Phycoerythrin Streptavidin for signal enhancement. The chip was scanned with GeneArray Scanner G2500A (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA)   Scaling and normalization of data:   The array images were analyzed with Microarray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) software. All chips were scaled (global scaling) to target intensity of 50 to minimize differences between chips caused by physical differences in chips, hybridization efficiencies and manual laboratory work. The data was subjected to robust normalization that reduces the errors, which are caused by binding capacity and linearity differences between probe sets.

Total RNA from the OE was hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays.  A number of chemokine-, cytokine-, and growth factor-related genes were significantly regulated in the Ccl3-/- mice, and were restored in CCL3 protein-injected Ccl3-/- mice.  The results illustrated that CCL3 played a key role in recruitment of macrophages to the OE and provided insight into the genomic regulation involved in OE remodeling.

Five ob/ob mice (sample_ids GSM32865-GSM32869) were placed in the intermittent hypoxia (IH) chamber and subjected to IH for 12 consecutive weeks and compared to pair-fed control exposed to intermittent room (IA) air for 12 weeks in identical chambers (n = 5, sample_ids GSM32860-GSM32864). The IH and IA states were induced during the light phase alternating with 12 h of constant room air during the dark phase. The IH and IA groups were weight-matched daily during the experiment by varying food intake. Weight-matching was conducted in pairs. The signal intensity fluorescent images produced during samples hybridizations to Affymetrix GeneChip were read using the Agilent Gene Array Scanner and converted into GeneChip Cell files (CEL) using MAS 5.0 software (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Gene expression values were generated form CEL files using Robust Microarray Analysis (RMA, Bioconductor affy package). Briefly, the rma module of this package was used for background correction, across array normalization, and extraction of the probe level data.

However, since the frontal cortex is one of the most important regions for antipsychotic actions, this study attempted to classify antipsychotic drugs based on gene expression in the frontal cortex. Chlorpromazine and thioridazine were selected as typical antipsychotics, and olanzapine and quetiapine as atypical antipsychotics. Since these drugs have similar chemical structures, the effect of the basic structure on gene expression can be eliminated. Cluster analysis of microarray experiments showed thioridazine and olanzapine constituted a robust cluster. K-means clustering separated 4-drug-administered mice into chlorpromazine-quetiapine and thioridazine-olanzapine groups. This classification scheme is different from that which is based on criteria currently used to group the typical and atypical drugs and suggests that antipsychotic drugs can be further separated into multiple groups. Keywords: repeat sample Male 13-week-old ddY mice (Japan SLC Co., Hamamatsu, Japan) weighing 38-43 g were used. Animals were housed with free access to standard food in an air-conditioned room under a constant dark-and-light cycle (light: 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) at a temperature of 22 to 24  C and 60 to 70% relative humidity. Ether was used for anesthesia during decapitation. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. The present experiments were carried out after obtaining permission from the Committee of Animal Experimentation of the Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences at Kagoshima University.Doses of 25 mg/kg chlorpromazine HCl (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO), 25 mg/kg thioridazine HCl (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), 1.25 mg/kg olanzapine (gift from Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) and 18.75 mg/kg quetiapine fumarate (gift from AstraZeneca, Macclesfield, UK) were used in the study. The dosages for these drugs were determined from therapeutically equivalent doses previously reported (Lehman et al, 2003; Woods, 2003). The drugs were dissolved in acetic anhydride and diluted with 0.9% saline, resulting in a final concentration of acetic acid of 0.5%. The drugs were injected intraperitoneally once daily for 28 consecutive days in a volume of 0.1 ml/10 g body weight.Microarray experiments were performed using an Agilent G4121A Mouse Oligo Microarray Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) as per the manufacturer   s instructions. The frontal cortex was immediately removed and the RNA was stabilized in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and stored at -80  C until use. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The RNA was amplified and labeled by the Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent). To synthesize cDNA, 200 ng total RNA was used. Vehicle-injected controls were labeled by cyanine 3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Boston, MA) and drug-injected mice were labeled by cyanine 5 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.). Hybridizations to the microarray were performed using the In situ Hybridization Kit Plus (Agilent). Doses of 750 ng cyanine 3-labeled cRNA, 750 ng cyanine 5-labeled cRNA, and control targets were mixed and fragmented in the kit   s fragmentation buffer, and then hybridized to the microarrays for 17 hours at 60  C in a hybridization rotator (Agilent) set to rotate at 4 rpm. Microarrays were washed in 6  SSC with 0.005% Triton X-102 at RT for 10 min, followed by 0.1  SSC with 0.005% Triton X-102 at 4  C for 5 min. The slides were dried, and then scanned by the Agilent G2565BA Microarray Scanner System. Data were analyzed using the Agilent Feature Extraction Software version 7.1. A rank consistency filter and LOWESS were used for dye normalization. Control mice and drug-injected mice were processed in parallel. The data discussed in this publication are presented in accordance with the MIAME guidelines (http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html) and were deposited in NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

The induction of specific tolerance would be the ultimate achievement in transplant immunology, but the precise mechanisms of immunological tolerance remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated global gene expression analysis in tolerizing murine cardiac allografts by means of oligonucleotide microarrays. Tolerance induction was achieved in cardiac allografts from BALB/c to C57BL/6 mice by daily intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD80 and CD86 mAbs. Comparative analysis revealed 64 genes to be induced more extensively in the tolerizing than in the syngeneic isografts, and 16 genes than in the rejecting allografts. Two genes were specifically upregulated in the tolerizing allografts. In the tolerizing allografts there were induced marked expressions of a number of genes for proinflammatory factors, including interferon-gamma inducible cytokines and chemokines, as well as apoptosis-related genes which were also upregulated in the rejecting allografts. Moreover, these gene expression patterns continued to be upregulated more than 70 days post transplant. These results provide evidence that immunological tolerance can be induced and maintained in the presence of prominent proinflammatory gene expression in vivo.

We show that the metabolic enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) is a critical and direct regulator of histone acetylation in neurons and of long-term mammalian memory. We observe increased nuclear ACSS2 in differentiating neurons in vitro. Genome-wide, ACSS2 binding corresponds with increased histone acetylation and gene expression of key neuronal genes. These data indicate that ACSS2 functions as a chromatin-bound co-activator to increase local concentrations of acetyl-CoA and to locally promote histone acetylation for transcription of neuron-specific genes. Remarkably, in vivo attenuation of hippocampal ACSS2 expression in adult mice impairs long-term spatial memory, a cognitive process reliant on histone acetylation. ACSS2 reduction in hippocampus also leads to a defect in upregulation of key neuronal genes involved in memory. These results reveal a unique connection between cellular metabolism and neural plasticity, and establish a link between generation of acetyl-CoA and neuronal chromatin regulation.

Here we studied the function of PAX5-ETV6 and PAX5- FOXP1 in mice expressing these proteins from the Pax5 locus. Both proteins arrested Blymphopoiesis at the pro-B-to-pre-B cell transition and, contrary to their proposed dominantnegative role, did not interfere with the expression of most Pax5 target genes. Pax5-Etv6, but not Pax5-Foxp1, cooperated with loss of the Cdkna2a/b tumor suppressor in promoting B-ALL development. Regulated Pax5-Etv6 target genes identified in these B-ALLs encode proteins implicated in pre-BCR signaling and migration/adhesion, which could contribute to the proliferation, survival and tissue infiltration of leukemic B-cells. Together with similar observations made in human PAX5-ETV6+ B-ALLs, these data identified PAX5-ETV6 as a potent oncoprotein. 36 samples in total: A) 24 RNA-Seq samples in 5 cell types: pro-B (5 genotypes, 2-4 replicates) large pre-B (2 genotypes, 2 replicates each) small pre-B (1 genotype, 2 replicates) lymph node (1 genotype, 3 replicates) bone marrow (1 genotype, 2 replicates) B) 12 ChIP-Seq samples in 2 cell types: pro-B (H3K27me3, H3K9ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, 1 replicate each; Pax5Etv6 ChIP, Prd ChIP, 2 replicates each; Pax5 ChIP 1 replicate) lymph node (1 genotype, 2 replicates). ..

During severe hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis uncontrolled heme exposure can cause acute kidney injury and endothelial damage. The cytotoxic activity of heme has been primarily attributed to its pro-oxidative potential. However, the mechanisms of heme toxicity have never been systematically explored. Besides its redox reactivity, heme could also adversely alter cellular functions through its broad binding affinity to multiple non-hemoproteins. Such interactions may impair protein functions and support heme toxicity. In this study we mapped the gene expression profile of Hb triggered acute kidney injury in old blood transfused guinea pigs by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). Additionally, the toxic heme response of mouse embryo fibroblasts was systematically characterized on the gene and protein expression levels by gene array experiments and quantitative mass-spectrometry of stable isotope labeled cells. In all these studies, in addition to oxidative stress signals, the most significant signals were reproducibly found for biologic networks related to altered protein degradation, which ultimately triggers the response to unfolded proteins and apoptosis. These screening data could be mechanistically explained by heme-proteasome interactions and a proteasome inhibitor activity of heme. Proteasome inhibition drastically reduced the threshold of cellular toxicity during heme exposure. We therefore propose a novel model of heme toxicity whereby proteasome inhibition by the porphyrin fuels a vicious cycle of oxidative protein modification, accumulation of damaged proteins, cell damage and apoptosis. A two color common reference design was chosen with 2-4 independent biological replicates of each condition. Each experimental sample (Cy5 labeled) was hybridized against a non-treated reference sample (Cy3 labeled). To compensate for dye bias control arrays with competitively hybridized Cy3- and Cy5-labeled non-treated reference samples were used. The latter allowed for a very robust statistical analysis with pair-wise comparison of treatment array replicates versus the corresponding control array replicates. ..

However, the mechanism(s) that control their specification remain unclear. We performed transcriptional, molecular and in situ spatio-temporal analyses of macrophage development in mice. We report that Erythro-Myeloid Progenitors generate pre-macrophages (pMacs) that simultaneously colonize the head and caudal embryo from embryonic day (E)9.5 in a chemokine-receptor dependent manner, to further differentiate into tissue F4/80+ macrophages. The core macrophage transcriptional program initiated in pMacs, is rapidly diversified in early macrophages as expression of transcriptional regulators becomes tissue-specific. For example, the preferential expression of the transcriptional regulator Id3 initiated in early fetal liver macrophages appears critical for Kupffer cell differentiation, as inactivation of Id3 causes a selective Kupffer cell deficiency that persists in adults. We propose that colonization of developing tissues by differentiating macrophages is immediately followed by their specification as they establish residence, hereby generating the macrophage diversity observed in post-natal tissues.

However, the mechanism underlying IL-3-mediated inhibition of osteoclast differentiation is not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-3 activation of STAT5 inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through the induction of Id genes. Methods: To investigate the effect of STAT5 on osteoclast differentiation and IL-3-mediated inhibition of osteoclast differentiation, bone marrow derived macrophages isolated from STAT5 wild-type (Stat5fl/fl) or STAT5 cKO (STAT5;MX1-Cre) were differentiated to osteoclast in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL with or without IL-3; and bone marrow derived macrophges from STAT5 wild-type and STAT5 cKO were overexpressed with PMX-FIG (control) or STAT5A1*6 (constitutively active form of STAT5A) and differentiated to osteoclast. To analyze bone phenotype, femurs and tibiae of 16 week-old STAT5 wild-type and STAT5 cKO were subjected to micro CT analysis and histomorphometry, respectively. Results: Overexpression of STAT5 inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. However, RANKL did not regulate either expression or activation of STAT5 during osteoclast differentiation. STAT5 deficiency prevented IL-3-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, suggesting that STAT5 plays an important role in IL-3-mediated inhibition of osteoclast differentiation. In addition, IL-3-induced STAT5 activation upregulated expression of the Id1 and Id2 genes, which are negative regulators of osteoclastogenesis. Overexpression of ID1 or ID2 in STAT5-deficient cells reversed osteoclast development recovered from IL-3-mediated inhibition. Moreover, micro-computed tomography and histomorphometric analysis revealed that STAT5 conditional knockout mice showed reduced bone mass, with an increased number of osteoclasts. Furthermore, IL-3 inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation less effectively in STAT5 conditional knockout mice than in wild-type mice in a RANKL injection model.

Most of the HSPC defects are secondary to increased levels of DNA damage and intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To obtain first insights into underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed Affymetrix gene chip analysis using total RNA isolated from FACS-sorted Lin-Sca1+Kit+ (LSK) cells of Mll5+/+ and Mll5-/- mice, both with and without prior long-term treatment with the ROS quencher N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC). As key finding, microarray data revealed elevated hybridization signals for several transcripts of known or putative IFN-1 target genes in LSK cells from Mll5-/- mice irrespective of NAC-treatment. In fact, comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis identified a number of gene sets closely associated with interferon responses that were significantly affected in Mll5-/- LSK cells.

Trex1-/- mice develop lethal autoimmune multi-organ inflammation, which results from a chronic type I IFN response triggered by intracellular accumulation of a putative nucleic acid substrate of Trex1. This pathogenic nucleic acid is detected by the broadly, but not ubiquitously, expressed cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, raising the question whether there are specific cell types that respond to Trex1 deficiency by production of IFN and induce autoimmunity. We generated mice with conditional knock out of the Trex1 gene and demonstrated that loss of Trex1 throughout the hematopoietic system and even selective loss in dendritic cells is sufficient to cause IFN release and autoimmunity. B cells showed no transcriptional response to Trex1 deficiency. Trex1-/- keratinocytes produced IFN but did not induce skin inflammation, whereas loss of Trex1 in cardiomyocytes triggered neither IFN response nor pathology. Trex1-deficient neurons and astrocytes did not release IFN in the CNS. In contrast, mice with selective inactivation of Trex1 in long-living CNS macrophages such as microglia locally produced IFN but did not reproduce the mild encephalitis seen in Trex1-/- mice. Collectively, individual cell types differentially respond to the loss of Trex1 and dendritic cells seem promising candidates for experiments addressing the molecular pathomechanism in Trex1 deficiency. We sorted CD19-positive B cells from spleens of Trex1fl/fl CD19-Cre+ and Trex1fl/fl CD19-Cre- mice and isolated total RNA for library construction to perform mRNA deep sequencing. ..

Here, we demonstrate genome engineering in postnatal mice using AAV-split-Cas9, a multi-functional platform customizable for genome-editing, transcriptional regulation, and other previously impracticable AAV-CRISPR-Cas9 applications. We identify crucial parameters that impact efficacy and clinical translation of our platform, including viral biodistribution, editing efficiencies in various organs, antigenicity, immunological reactions, and physiological outcomes. These results reveal that AAV-CRISPR-Cas9 evokes host responses with distinct cellular and molecular signatures, but unlike alternative delivery methods, does not induce detectable cellular damage in vivo.

Patients who receive BRAF inhibitors develop a variety of hyper-proliferative skin conditions, whose pathogenic basis is the paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in BRAF wild-type cells. Most of these hyper-proliferative skin changes improve when a MEK inhibitor is co-administered, as a MEK inhibitor blocks paradoxical MAPK activation. We tested whether we could take advantage of the mechanistic understanding of the skin hyper-proliferative side effects of BRAF inhibitors to accelerate skin wound healing by inducing paradoxical MAPK activation. Here we show that the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib accelerates human keratinocyte proliferation and migration by increasing ERK phosphorylation and cell cycle progression. Topical treatment with vemurafenib in two wound-healing models in mice accelerated cutaneous wound healing and improved the tensile strength of healing wounds through paradoxical MAPK activation; addition of a MEK inhibitor reversed the benefit of vemurafenib-accelerated wound healing. The same dosing regimen of topical BRAF inhibitor did not increase the incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in mice even after the application of a carcinogen. Therefore, topical BRAF inhibitors may have clinical applications in accelerating the healing of skin wounds.

This phenomenon highlights the necessity of the mechanism that operates to segregate the identities of the two cell-types throughout differentiation after initial fate commitment. To understand this mechanism, we investigated the fate specification of spinal V2a interneurons, which share important developmental genes with motor neurons (MNs). Here we demonstrate that the paired homeodomain factor Chx10 functions as a critical determinant for V2a fate and is required to consolidate V2a identity in postmitotic neurons. Chx10 actively promotes V2a fate, downstream of the LIM-homeodomain factor Lhx3, while concomitantly suppressing MN developmental program by preventing the MN-specific transcription complex from binding and activating MN genes. This dual activity enables Chx10 to effectively separate V2a and MN pathways. Together, our study uncovers a widely applicable gene regulatory principle for segregating related cell fates. RNA samples from Chx10-ESC-derived MNs were prepared for sequencing according to the Illumina protocol, and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000. We will then compare the transcriptome changes between -Dox (no Chx10) and +Dox (Chx10) in order to identify genes rregulated by Chx10. ..

However, the spatiotemporal mechanisms by which PRC2 achieves diverse epigenomes for specific tissue or cellular contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we discovered that LATS2 knockout causes dysregulation of PRC2 and subsequent transcriptome changes for differentiation in both mouse and human cells. LATS2 depletion dependent dysregulation of PRC2 also effects H3K4me3 and forms negative feedback loop for maintenance of PRC2. Further analyses reveal that LATS2 on chromatin binds to EZH2 and LATS2 has ability to phosphorylate PRC2 in vitro. These LATS2 dependent H3K27me3 targets are highly induced during neurogenesis, and statistical analysis of glioblastoma multiforme reveals that LATS2-high cases show more dedifferentiated transcriptome and poor prognosis with silencing of H3K27me3 targets. These observations suggest that LATS2-mediated epigenome coordination is pivotal for development and disease, including cancer.

We here challenge this view and demonstrate that mouse embryos in the mitotic cell cycle can also directly reprogram sperm for full term development. Developmentally incompetent haploid embryos (parthenogenotes) injected with sperm developed to produce healthy offspring at up to 24% of control rates, depending when in the embryonic cell cycle injection took place. This implies that most of the first embryonic cell cycle can be bypassed in sperm genome reprogramming for full development. Remodeling of histones and genomic 5'- methylcytosine and 5'-hydroxymethylcytosine following embryo injection were distinct from remodeling in fertilization and the resulting 2-cell embryos consistently possessed abnormal transcriptomes. These studies demonstrate plasticity in the reprogramming of terminally differentiated sperm nuclei and suggest that different epigenetic pathways or kinetics can establish totipotency. phICSI vs ICSI .. individual 2-cell stage blastomere;  C57BL/6 x DBA/2 (B6D2F1);  total RNA;  single cell whole transcriptome amplification;  individual 2-cell stage blastomere;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Sperm preparation was essentially as previously described (Suzuki et al., 2010).

Despite the importance of X inactivation, little is known about the 3D configuration of Xi and its relationship to gene silencing. We recently showed that in humans, Xi exhibits two distinctive structural features. First, Xi is partitioned into two huge intervals, called superdomains, such that pairs of loci in each superdomain show an enhanced contact frequency with one another. The boundary between the two superdomains lies near DXZ4, a macrosatellite repeat spanning ~300kb, whose Xi allele extensively binds the protein CTCF. Second, Xi exhibits extremely large loops, up to 77Mb long, called superloops. DXZ4 lies at the anchor of several superloops. Here, we use 3D mapping to study the structure of Xi, focusing on the role of DXZ4. We show that superloops and superdomains are conserved across mammals. We develop a novel variant of our in situ Hi-C protocol, dubbed COLA (COncatemer Ligation Assay) to probe the higher order structures formed by the superloops. In COLA, in situ proximity ligation of multiple extremely short fragments produced by the enzyme CviJI is used to efficiently map simultaneous proximity among three or more loci. Using data from Hi-C and COLA, we demonstrate that DXZ4 and other superloop anchors tend to co-locate simultaneously within the same cells, a result that is confirmed by 3D-FISH. Finally, we examine the effects of deleting DXZ4 from Xi in human cells. Using in situ Hi-C, microscopy, and RNA-FISH, we show that superdomains and superloops disappear; that Xi frequently dissociates into multiple separate structures; and that transcriptional silencing on Xi is compromised. Deletion of DXZ4 from the active X chromosome (Xa) has no such effect. Thus, DXZ4 is essential for proper folding and silencing of Xi. Hi-C protocol was used on wildtype and DXZ4-deleted cells to examine the structure of Xi. A novel variant of our in situ Hi-C protocol, dubbed COLA (COncatemer Ligation Assay), was developed to probe the higher order structures formed by the superloops.This series also includes RNA-seq data on Retinal Pigmented Epithelial Cells (hTERT-RPE1).The samples starting with the prefix 'RaoHuntley-2014' were generated as part of the study described in GSE63525 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63525). ..

Here we present Haemopedia, a comprehensive atlas of murine gene expression data that covers all the mature lineages in haematopoiesis, including rare cell populations such as eosinophils, mast cells, basophils and megakaryocytes and a large collection of progenitor and stem cells. We have used this dataset to identify gene sets with specifically enriched expression in each of the mature blood cell lineages. Many of the genes in these sets show conserved lineage-enriched expression patterns in human haematopoiesis. We also identify some genes with divergent expression patterns between mouse and human, highlighting species specific differences in blood cell production. To make analyses of Haemopedia and other blood cell transcriptional datasets easier, we have created an online web portal, Haemosphere, which provides simple tools to interrogate gene expression-based relationships between haematopoietic cell types and genes of interest.

For this purpose, we obtained the transcriptomes of four stable 4T1 cell lines that either overexpress full length Mkl1-RFP (4T1-FL), Mkl1-RFP with a mutated SRF-interaction site (4T1-mutB1), Mkl1-RFP with a deletion of the SAP domain (4T1-  SAP) or an empty vector encoding RFP alone (4T1 control). Stable 4T1 cell lines were grown in triplicates in 0.03% FCS/DMEM medium for 48 h before total RNA was extracted. RNA was converted into labeled cDNA and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays. RMA normalized expression values were calculated with the affy package from the Bioconductor 2.4 release (1) and differentially expressed genes were identified using moderated t-statistics calculated with the empirical Bayes method as implemented in the Bioconductor limma package (2). To be considered as differentially expressed between 4T1-FL and 4T1-mutB1 or 4T1-   SAP cells, genes had to pass the filters: adjusted P-value     0.01 (with Benjamin-Hochberg false discovery correction), a minimum absolute linear fold change difference of 2.0 and a minimum average expression value of 4.0 (log2).

To obtain mature functions of the kidney, normal renal developmental processes need to be preceded. Comprehensive genetic programs underlying renal development during prenatal life have been widely studied. However, postnatal renal development, from infancy to juvenile period, have not been studied yet. Here, we investigated if structural and functional kidney development was still undergoing in early life by analyzing renal transcriptional networks of infant (4 weeks old) and juvenile (7 weeks old) mice. We further examined the effects of dehydration on kidney development. Kidneys at 4 weeks and 7 weeks old showed significantly distinctive functional network of genes. Gene sets related to cell cycle regulators and immature glomerular barrier integrity (COL4A1, COL4A2) were enriched in infantile kidneys while genes associated with ion transport and drug metabolism (CYP450 family) were shown in juvenile kidneys. Dehydration during infancy suppressed renal growth by interrupting SHH signaling pathway which targets cell cycle regulators. Importantly, disruption of developmental program ultimately led to long-term alterations in renal filtration function, by causing a decline in glomerular filtration barrier integrity. Taken together, we provide meaningful perspectives of renal development in infancy which suggests molecular and physiological background why infants are more vulnerable to dehydration than adults. These results provide new insights into the systemic effects of dehydration on renal development and may propose possible markers for clinical application in pediatric dehydration.

We further demonstrate that Glis3-deficiency causes a severe impairment in spermatogenesis in mice. Although the number of gonocytes was slightly diminished in Glis3KO testis, the number undifferentiated, PLZF+ spermatogonia was dramatically reduced leading to a virtual block in the progression of spermatogenesis. Gene expression profiling showed that the expression of a number of genes associated with self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial cells was significantly decreased in 1-week-old Glis3KO2 testis. These included a set of GDNF-dependent genes, such as Etv5, Bcl6b, Lhx1, Brachyury, Id4, and Pou3f1, and GDNF-independent genes, such as FoxO1, Oct4, and Zbtb16. Impairment of the nuclear localization of FoxO1 may be in part responsible for the reduced expression of Ret, Lhx1, and Sall4 in Glis3KO2 testis. Our study identifies Glis3 as a novel and critical regulator of early stages of spermatogenesis. Thy1+ cells were isolated from 3 WT and 3 Glis3KO2 testis at postnatal day 4, and total RNAs were purified from them. Then the samples were applied to Agilent mouse genome chip. ..

Clinical trials on patients suffering from type 2 diabetes indicated that BEZ also has beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Much less is known about the function of BEZ in type 1 diabetes. Here, we show that BEZ treatment markedly improves hyperglycemia, glucose and insulin tolerance in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice, an insulin-deficient mouse model of type 1 diabetes presenting with very high blood glucose levels. Furthermore, BEZ-treated mice also exhibited improved metabolic flexibility as well as an enhanced mitochondrial mass and function in the liver. Our data demonstrate a beneficial effect of BEZ treatment on STZ mice reducing diabetes and suggest that BEZ ameliorates impaired glucose metabolism possibly via augmented hepatic mitochondrial performance, improved insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility. We performed gene expression microarray analysis on liver tissue derived from streptozotocin-treated mice treated with bezafibrate in addition. .. 5-6 months;  male;  wildtype;  total RNA;  Liver tissue from streptozotocin/bezafibrate-treated mice;  C57BL/6N;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  streptozotocin/bezafibrate;  To induce type 1 diabetes, 65 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) was injected i.p. into 10-16 weeks-old mice on 5 consecutive days while respective controls were mock-injected with citrate buffer.

We report that regulated mRNA cap methylation is a feature of embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation.    Expression of the mRNA cap methyltransferase activating subunit, RAM, is elevated in ESCs resulting in high levels of mRNA cap methylation and expression of Oct4 and Sox2 and other pluripotency-associated factors.

Here we show that the genetic deletion of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme DICER in TAMs broadly programs them to a CD11c+MRC1   /low M1-like immunostimulatory phenotype characterized by activated interferon-   (IFN-  )/STAT1/IRF signaling. M1-like TAM programming fostered the recruitment of cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs), including tumor-antigen-specific CTLs, inhibited tumor growth, and enhanced the efficacy of PD1 checkpoint blockade. Bioinformatics analysis of TAM transcriptomes identified a limited set of miRNAs putatively involved in TAM programming. Re-expression of Let-7 in Dicer-deficient TAMs was sufficient to partly rescue the M2-like (protumoral) TAM phenotype and abate tumor CTL infiltration. Targeted suppression of DICER activity in TAMs may, therefore, stimulate antitumor immunity and enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. To explore the role of DICER in the development, activation and immunological functions of TAMs, we crossed homozygous LysM-Cre (Clausen et al., 1999) with Dicerlox/lox (Harfe et al., 2005) mice to obtain mice with myeloid-cell-specific Dicer1 gene deletion (LysM-Cre;Dicer   /   , referred to as D   /   ).

Together with T cells, the various ILC3 subsets maintain the balance between homeostasis and immune activation. Using genetic mapping, we reveal here the existence of a new subset of NCR- ILC3 transiently expressing Ncr1 but strongly related to unlabeled NCR- ILC3, demonstrating previously unsuspected heterogeneity within the NCR- ILC3 population. Notch signaling is required for the differentiation of NCR- ILC3 into NCR+ ILC3. However, we show here that Notch signaling must be sustained for the maintenance of the NCR+ phenotype and that TGF-   impairs the development of NCR+ ILC3.

However, the proportion of lncRNAs with biological activities among the thousands expressed in mammalian cells is controversial. We studied Lockd (Downstream of p27), a 434 bp polyadenylated lncRNA originating 4 kb 3    to the Cdkn1b gene. Heterozygous and homozygous deletion of the 25 kb Lockd locus reduced Cdkn1b transcription by approximately 35 and 70% respectively in a mouse erythroid cell line. In contrast, homozygous insertion of a polyadenylation cassette 80 bp downstream of the Lockd transcription start site reduced the entire lncRNA transcript level by > 90%, but had no effect on Cdkn1b transcription. The 5    region of the Lockd gene contains a DNase hypersensitive site, binds numerous transcription factors (TFs), and physically associates with the Cdkn1b promoter in chromosomal conformation capture (NG Capture-C) studies. Thus, the Lockd gene positively regulates Cdkn1b transcription through an enhancer-like cis element and not via the lncRNA transcript. These findings demonstrate that the biological functions of a lncRNA cannot be inferred simply from phenotypes that arise after deleting the corresponding genomic locus. We analyzed mouse G1E erythroid cell line clones with Control Lockd (C - 3 replicates) and with Lockd deletion with CRISPR (KO - 4 replicates) using Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array platform (transcript version).

MoRs are derived from sequences located immediately adjacent to microRNAs (miRs) in the primary miR (pri-miR). Currently moRs are considered to be simply a by-product of miR biosynthesis that lack biological activity. Here we show for the first time that a moR is biologically active. We now demonstrate that endogenous and over-expressed moR-21 significantly alters gene expression and inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). We report that the "seed region" of moR-21 as well as the "seed match region" in the target gene 3'UTR are indispensable for moR-21-mediated gene down-regulation. We further demonstrated that moR-21-mediated gene repression is Argonaute 2 (Ago2) dependent. In addition, we find that miR-21 and moR-21 may regulate different genes in a given pathway and can oppose each other in regulating certain genes. Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence that microRNA offset RNA regulates gene expression and is biologically active. Small RNAs were harvested from mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs), with three biological replicates, using miReasy kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer   s instructions. RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Small RNA library construction and illumina HiSeq 75bp single read sequencing were performed at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis. Reads were trimmed to remove adaptor sequences, and inserts longer than 13 bases were mapped to the mouse mm10 genome using Bowtie (with settings    n 0 -m 5 --best  --strata, allowing 0 mismatches and up to 5 genomic loci with a perfect match, {Genome Biol. 2009;10(3):R25, Langmead B, Trapnell C, Pop M, Salzberg SL}). Reads that mapped to within 50 bp of more than one annotated mouse pri-miR (as defined by miRBase {Kozomara A, Griffiths-Jones S. Nucelic Acids Res 2014 42:D68-D73}), were allotted evenly between these locations.

Reads that fell entirely within the range of 35 bp 3    to 3 bp 5    of the last base of a 3p miR were counted as 3p moR reads. Those that fell entirely between 3bp 3    and 35 bp 5    of the first base of a 5p miR were counted as 5p moR reads. On average each library contained 17.4 million qualifying inserts, of which 13.8 million (79.3%) mapped to one of these four regions, indicating that the large majority of inserts represented miR or moR sequences. Reads were divided by the number of million reads mapping to these regions in each library to give normalized reads per million reads (RPMR) values. ..

We report the application of unique spontaneous model that mimics cellular aging for understanding the origin and progression of HGSOC from oviductal epithelium. Oviductal epithelium is equivalent to human FTE. Serial passaging of the outbred mouse CD1 oviductal cells (MOE low) to MOE high produced transformed cells that lead to benign tumors. To understand the altered molecular signaling pathways in MOEhigh cells versus MOElow cells, we performed RNA sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from MOELOW (passages 8, 9, & 10) and MOEHIGH (passages 90, 103, & 113) cells. Each total RNA sample had ribosomal RNA removed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Strand-specific libraries were constructed and quantitated using Qubit, and cDNAs verified by qPCR. qRT   PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. Samples were barcoded and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing. The reads were aligned to the Mus musculus genome (mm10) using TopHat, version and were used to determine the expression of known mmu10 gene annotations from the University of California-Santa Cruz website using Cuffdiff version. By merging the individual transcript from Cuffdiff into a single gene annotation file, we determined the differential expression analysis. By applying a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value, where significance was set to p     0.05, statistically significant differential expression was determined. Furthermore, pathway analysis was performed on transcript lists from both cell lines using GeneCoDis to identify the KEGG and Panther pathways that are significantly different between MOELOW and MOEHIGH cell lines. We find that the splicesome, RNA transport, the cell cycle, and DNA replication were the most highly upregulated pathway whereas the repressed pathways included processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, focal adhesion, and the lysosome. RNA sequencing revealed that p53 in MOELOW and MOEHIGH cells was not mutated; however, MOEHIGH cells had a significant upregulation of a splice variant of p53. The splice variant behaved like wild-type on few targets and missense on some transcriptional targets by qRT-PCR. This study provides a framework for the application of comprehensive chromatin profiling towards characterization of diverse mammalian cell populations. This model provides a framework to uncover a step-wise progression of tumor formation from an oviductal origin to be compared to human disease.

SUMOylation is an important post-translational modification characterized by covalent attachment of SUMO moieties to lysine within proteins. UBC9 is the only E2 conjugation enzyme involved in this process and loss of UBC9 completely impairs the SUMOylation pathway. Here we report that selective deletion of  Ubc9  within the Treg cell lineage resulted in fatal early-onset autoimmunity as the Foxp3 mutant mice. Ubc9-deficient Treg cells exhibited severe defects in TCR-driven homeostatic proliferation, accompanied by impaired activation and compromised suppressor function. Importantly, TCR-enhanced SUMOylation of IRF4, a critical regulator of Treg cell function downstream of TCR signals, regulates its stability in Treg cells. Our data thus have demonstrated an essential role of SUMOylation in the expansion and function of Treg cells.

A recent study showed a subset of DS cells, identified as hair follicle (HF) dermal stem cells, can be mobilized to regenerate DS, maintain/supply the cell number of dermal papilla (DP) and modulate hair type. However, it is unclear how Wnt/  -catenin signaling regulates DS cells behaviors. Here we report that activation of   -catenin in DS, to some extent, endows it with hair inducing ability, reprogramming HF epidermal cells to generate new outgrowth. The new formed dermal condensates (DC)/DP lying adjacent the outgrowth derives from DS and/or its progeny, and homeostasis of pre-existing HFs is disturbed. Additionally, progressive skin fibrosis is prominent in hypodermis, where the excessive activated fibroblasts at least partially originate from DS and/or its progeny. Gene expression analysis of purified DS cells revealed that 44% DC signature genes are regulated, most of which are up-regulated. We found elevated expression of several growth factors, including Noggin, Fgf7 and Fgf10, which were previously implicated in HF induction. In summary, we confirm the high plasticity of DS cells by in vivo assays and report a mechanism by which Wnt/  -catenin signaling controls DS cells behaviors.

Here, we examined the length of time that the RNA from postmortem tissues is available for microarray analysis and reported the gene expression profile for up- and down-regulated genes during the postmortem interval (PMI). We extracted RNA from fresh-frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brains and livers of three different groups of mice: 1) mice immediately after death, 2) mice that were stored at room temperature for 3 h after death, and 3) mice that were stored at 4  C for 18 h after death, as this storage resembles the human autopsy process in Japan. Based on the microarray analysis, we selected genes that were altered by >1.3-fold or <0.77-fold and classified these genes using hierarchical cluster analysis following DAVID (database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery) gene ontology analysis. These studies revealed that cytoskeleton-related genes were enriched in the set of up-regulated genes, while serine protease inhibitors were enriched in the set of down-regulated genes. Interestingly, although the RNA quality was maintained, up-regulated genes were not validated by quantitative PCR, suggesting that these genes may become fragmented or modified by an unknown mechanism. We extracted RNA from fresh-frozen (FF) brains and livers from mice under three different conditions: 1) mice just after death as a control, 2) mice that were stored at room temperature for 3 h after death, and 3) mice that were stored at 4  C for 18 h after death to resemble the human autopsy process.

Although many studies have suggested a contribution to carcinogenesis, it is still unclear whether the aberrant DNA hypomethylation observed in tumors is a consequence or a cause of cancer. We found that overexpression of Stella (also known as PGC7, Dppa3), a maternal factor required for the maintenance of DNA methylation in early embryos, induced global DNA hypomethylation and transformation in NIH3T3 cells. This hypomethylation was due to the binding of Stella to Np95 (also known as Uhrf1, ICBP90) and the subsequent impairment of Dnmt1 localization. In addition, enforced expression of Stella enhanced the metastatic ability of B16 melanoma cells through the induction of metastasis-related genes by inducing DNA hypomethylation of their promoter regions. Such DNA hypomethylation itself causes cellular transformation and metastatic ability. These data provide new insight into the function of global DNA hypomethylation in carcinogenesis. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression by PGC7/Stella overexpression. RNA was extracted from NIH3T3 or B16F10 murine cell lines overexpressed PGC7/Stella and was hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We compared gene expression levels between control and PGC7/Stella-overexpressed cells.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the endometrial specific transcriptional and functional role of SF1 in vivo by utilizing a mouse model in which SF1 was conditionally expressed in the uterus. SF1 expression resulted in the development of cystic endometrial glands and infertility. Endometriosis induction by auto-transplantation of a biopsy of uterine tissue sutured to the mesenteric membrane resulted in 4-fold increase in size ectopic lesions from SF1 expressing mice.

To validate the potential relevance of mouse models of targeting the Th17 pathway in human diseases we used RNA sequencing to compare the expression of coding and non-coding transcripts during the priming of Th17 cell differentiation in both human and mouse. In addition to already known targets, several transcripts not previously linked to Th17 cell polarization were found in both species. Moreover, a considerable number of human-specific long non-coding RNAs were identified that responded to cytokines stimulating Th17 cell differentiation. We integrated our transcriptomics data with known disease-associated polymorphisms and show that conserved regulation pinpoints genes that are relevant to Th17 cell-mediated human diseases and that can be modelled in mouse. Substantial differences observed in non-coding transcriptomes between the two species as well as increased overlap between Th17 cell-specific gene expression and disease-associated polymorphisms underline the need of parallel analysis of human and mouse models. Comprehensive analysis of genes regulated during Th17 cell priming and their classification to conserved and non-conserved between human and mouse facilitates translational research, pointing out which candidate targets identified in human are worth studying by using in vivo mouse models. Altogether 114 (57 human and 57 mouse) samples were analyzed representing 3 biological replicates of timeseries data (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours) of Th17 polarized cells and control Th0 cells ..

Although the mechanism of this process has not yet been elucidated, it is likely to involve the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC by Tet enzymes [Ziller, 2013 #5787].  In this paper, we show that a Tet2/Tet3 conditional knockout at early stages of B-cell development largely prevents lineage-specific programmed demethylation events. This lack of demethylation affects the expression of nearby B-cell lineage genes, probably by inhibiting enhancer activity, thus causing defects in B- cell differentiation.  Our studies represent the first demonstration that tissue-specific demethylation may be necessary for proper development in vivo.

Using a solid tumor model in mice, we found that CD8+ T cells became tolerized in less than 24 hours in an established tumor environment. To define the collective impact of pathways suppressing TIL function, we compared genome-wide mRNA expression of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells from the tumor and periphery. Notably, gene expression induced during TIL hypofunction more closely resembled self-tolerance than viral-exhaustion. Differential gene expression was refined to identify a core set of genes that defined hypofunctional TIL; these data comprise the first    molecular profile    of tumor-specific TIL that are naturally responding and represent a polyclonal repertoire. The molecular profile of TIL was further dissected to determine the extent of overlap and distinction between pathways that collectively restrict T cell functions. As suggested by the molecular profile of TIL, protein expression of inhibitory receptor LAG-3 was differentially regulated throughout prolonged late-G1/early-S phase of the cell cycle.

During this transition, mRNAs coding for chromatin regulators were specifically released from translational inhibition mediated by RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). This suggests that, prior to differentiation, the propensity of ES cells to change their epigenetic status is hampered by RNA interference. The expression of these chromatin regulators was reinstated following acute inactivation of RISC, and it correlated with loss of stemness markers and activation of early cell differentiation markers in treated ES cells.

Here we generated a non-transgenic and polyclonal model of reduced TCR expression and signal strength selectively on      T cells. Mice haploinsufficient for both CD3   and CD3   (CD3DH) showed normal      thymocyte subsets but specific defects in      T cell development, namely impaired differentiation of IL-17-producing embryonic V  6+ (but not adult V  4+)      T cells and a marked depletion of IFN-  -producing CD122+ NK1.1+ (V  1-biased)      T cells throughout life.

In CN-AML with poorer prognosis, mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) commonly co-occur (1-3). We demonstrate that mice with Flt3-internal-tandem duplication (Flt3ITD) and inducible deletion of Dnmt3a spontaneously develop a rapidly-lethal, completely-penetrant, and transplantable AML of normal karyotype. These murine AML retain a single Dnmt3a floxed allele, revealing the oncogenic potential of Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency. FLT3-ITD/DNMT3A-mutant primary human and murine AML demonstrate a similar pattern of global DNA methylation. In the murine model, rescuing DNMT3A expression was accompanied by DNA re-methylation and loss of clonogenic potential, suggesting that Dnmt3a-mutant oncogenic effects are reversible.  Differentially methylated genomic regions were associated with changes in the expression of nearby genes. Moreover, dissection of the cellular architecture of the AML model using single-cell RNA-Seq, flow cytometry and colony assays identified clonogenic subpopulations that differentially express genes that are sensitive to the methylation of nearby genomic loci and varied in response to Dnmt3a levels. Thus, Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency transforms Flt3ITD myeloproliferative disease by modulating methylation-sensitive gene expression within a clonogenic AML subpopulation.

The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown.  Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state.  But in the case of most other gene groups, hybrids were individually distinct.  In fact, though hybrids can express a transcriptome similar to individual fusion partners, approximately one-third acquired distinct expression profiles in a single day.  Some hybrids underwent reprogramming, expressing pluripotency and cardiac precursor genes latent in parental cells and associated with developmental and morphogenic gene groups.  Other hybrids expressed genes associated with ontologic cancer sets and two hybrids of separate experimental replicates clustered with breast cancer cells, expressing critical oncogenes and lacking tumor suppressor genes. Rapid transcriptional diversification of this type garners consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to damaged tissues, those with viral infection or other microenvironmental conditions that might promote fusion. Examination was performed using single-cell RNA-seq of five fusion products (BiFC_D1_F1-5, 24 hours) identified using BiFC, twenty-three fusion products (DC_D1_F1-16, 24 hours; DC_D3_F1-7, 72 hours) identified using dual expression of GFP and mCherry, the parental controls, and the population controls (mMSC_PC and HL1cm_PC).

The recombinant DNA system contains three components and enables fusion only when the hemagglutinin (H) protein of the virus binds to the human signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (hSLAM) of the human cell, which then forms a trimeric complex with the fusion protein (F) of the virus to initiate fusion. HL1cms are transfected with the receptor component, hSLAM, while MSCs are transfected with the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins (viral fusogens provided by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison). Fusion only occurs when all three proteins are present and we utilized this ability to induce fusion between MSCs and HL1cms. Transfection was accomplished using the Neon Transfection System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer?s protocol. Briefly, 5 x 105 HL1cms were transfected with 2 ?g of hSLAM and 2 ?g of the detection system plasmid with one 1,300 V pulse for 30 msec and plated into 6-well plates (Falcon, Fisher Scientific, Forest Lawn, NJ) containing Claycomb-complete medium without penicillin-streptomycin as per Neon Transfection System protocol.  The HL1cm electroporation was repeated and added to the same well to obtain approximately 1 x 106 total cells transfected.   Eighteen hours later, fresh Claycomb-complete medium without penicillin-streptomycin was added to the transfected HL1cm and 5 x 105 MSCs were transfected with 2 ?g of F-H and 2 ?g of the detection system plasmid  with one 1,500 V pulse for 20 msec and plated directly onto the previously electroporated HL1cms in the 6-well plate.  The co-culture was allowed to incubate overnight and the fusion products were analyzed on the following day and identified using flow cytometry for GFP.;

Human cells such as human foreskin fibroblast(HHFs), Hela cells and born marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSC) can also be converted into neuron-like cells by this medium with some modification such as including several other small molecules. To understand the possible mechanisms, the transdifferentiation of MEFs by 6C was chosen as a model system and gene profiling at different time point during the conversion was carried out by RNA sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. MEFs was maintained in MEF medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1mM Glutamax and 100X NEAA), to start the induction, the culture medium was shift to 6C and marked as day 0, neurons could be generated in day 15. mRNA samples was collected at day 0, 2, 5, 10, 15 during the process, with cell lysed by Trizol and mRNA enriched by Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation v2 kit. We find that most cell cycle related genes were up regulated during the first few days of induction, while many Notch pathway genes up regulated during the later phase of this process. The RNA sequencing data provided important cues for further study on the mechanisms of the direct neuronal induction process.

The secretion of type I interferon of pDCs is modulated by Siglec-H, a DAP12 associated receptor on pDCs. We showed that Siglec-H deficient pDCs produce more of the type I interferon IFN-   in vitro and that Siglec-H ko mice produce more IFN-   after murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) infection in vivo, leading to efficient clearance of the virus. Furthermore, ageing Siglec-H ko mice showed a mild form of systemic autoimmunity. In contrast, Siglec-H ko mice developed a severe form of systemic lupus-like autoimmune disease with strong kidney nephritis several weeks after a single mCMV infection. This induction of systemic autoimmune disease after virus infection in Siglec-H ko mice was accompanied by a type I interferon signature and fully dependent on type I interferon signaling. These results show that Siglec-H normally serves as modulator of type I interferon responses after infection with a persistent virus and thereby prevents induction of autoimmune disease.

These cells are characterized by a high degree of plasticity, and alter their phenotype in response to local environmental cues. While the M1/M2 classification of macrophages has been widely used, the complexity of macrophage phenotypes specifically in lung cancer has not been well studied. In this study we employed an orthotopic immunocompetent model of lung adenocarcinoma in which murine lung cancer cells are directly implanted into the left lobe of syngeneic mice. Using multi-marker flow cytometry we defined and recovered several distinct populations of monocytes/macrophages from tumors at different stages of progression. We used RNA-seq transcriptional profiling to define distinct features of each population and determine how they change during tumor progression. We defined an alveolar resident macrophage population that does not change in number and express multiple genes related to lipid metabolism and lipid signaling. We also defined a population of tumor-associated macrophages that increase dramatically with tumor, and selectively express a panel of chemokines genes. A third population, which resembles tumor-associated monocytes, expresses a large number of genes involved in matrix remodeling. By correlating transcriptional profiles with clinically prognostic genes, we show that specific monocyte/macrophage populations are enriched in genes that predict good or poor outcome in lung adenocarcinoma, implicating these subpopulations as critical determinants of patient survival. Our data underscore the complexity of monocytes/macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, and suggest that distinct populations play specific roles in tumor progression. mRNA profiles of macrophage/monocyte cells isolated from murine control or  tumor-bearing lung.

The RAS/MAPK-signalling pathway is frequently deregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), often through activating mutations in KRAS. Mouse models demonstrated that activation of a single endogenous mutant Kras allele is sufficient to promote lung tumour formation, but acquisition of other genetic alterations is required for malignant progression. Using a well-established lung cancer mouse model we recently demonstrated that advanced KrasG12D-driven spontaneous tumours frequently exhibit enhanced MAPK signalling and KrasG12D allelic enrichment (KrasG12D/Kraswild-type>1), implying that mutant Kras copy gains are positively selected during lung cancer progression. To compare the oncogenic impact of a single mutant allele versus additional mutant Kras copy gain, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of mutant Kras homozygous and heterozygous MEFs and lung cancer cells and show that these genotypes are phenotypically distinct.

We sought to identify pericytic miRNAs that could serve as a target to decrease myofibroblast formation. We induced kidney fibrosis in FoxD1-GC;Z/Red-mice by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) followed by FACS sorting of dsRed-positive FoxD1-derivative cells and miRNA profiling. MiR-132 selectively increased 21-fold during pericyte-to-myofibroblast formation whereas miR-132 was only 2.5-fold up in total kidney lysates (both in UUO and ischemia-reperfusion injury). MiR-132 silencing in UUO decreased collagen deposition (35%) and tubular apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry, western blot and qRT-PCR confirmed a similar decrease in interstitial   -SMA+ cells. Pathway analysis identified a rate-limiting role for miR-132 in myofibroblast proliferation that was confirmed in vitro. Indeed, antagomir-132 treated mice displayed a reduction in the number of proliferating, ki67+ interstitial myofibroblasts. Interestingly, this was selective for the interstitial compartment and did not impair the reparative proliferation of tubular epithelial cells, as evidenced by an increase in ki67+ epithelial cells, as well as increased (p-)RB1, Cyclin-A and decreased RASA1, p21 levels in kidney lysates. Taken together, silencing miR-132 counteracts the progression of renal fibrosis by selectively decreasing myofibroblast proliferation and could potentially serve as a novel antifibrotic therapy.

RAS also regulates cell motility and tumor invasiveness, but the role of direct RAS binding to PI3-Kinase in this remains uncertain. Here, we provide evidence that disruption of RAS interaction with PI3-Kinase p110adecreases cell motility and prevents activation of Rac GTPase. Analysis of gene expression in cells lacking RAS interaction with p110areveals increased levels of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein Reelin  and activation of its downstream pathway resulting in upregulation of E-Cadherin expression. Induction of the Reelin / E-Cadherin axis is also observed in Kras mutant lung tumours that are regressing due to blockade of RAS interaction with PI3-Kinase. Furthermore, loss of Reelin correlates with decreased  survival of lung and breast cancer patients.  Reelin thus plays a role in restraining RAS and PI3-kinase promotion of cell motility and potentially tumour metastasis. MEFs with or without RAS binding to p110a were seeded in a 10cm dish and left to attach during 24 hours. Full serum media was then removed and media with no FBS was added to the plates. Starvation was carried out during a period of 16 hours (over night starvation). Assay was performed in triplicates: for each genotype two diferent fibroblasts clones (and a mix of both of the clones) were used on the analysis.

Here, mice with an adipose-specific defect in fatty acid oxidation (Cpt2A-/-) were subjected to varying temperature to determine the role of adipose bioenergetics to environmental adaptation. Cpt2A-/- brown adipose tissue (BAT) failed to induce thermogenic genes such as Ucp1 and Pgc1   in response to adrenergic stimulation, which is exacerbated by increasing temperature. Thermoneutrality induced a mitochondrial DNA stress in Cpt2A-/- BAT that resulted in a loss of classical interscapular BAT, but did not affect body weight gain or glucose tolerance in response to a high-fat diet. In this dataset, we include the expression data obtained from dissected mouse interscapular brown adipose tissue from mice acclimatized to thermoneutrality (30C) with and without beta3adrenergic stimulation with and without the deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (i.e., adipose unable to beta-oxidize long chain fatty acids in mitochondria).

Plasma cell differentiation requires a major resetting of gene expression to silence the B cell transcriptional program, whilst establishing secretory function and long-term survival. The transcription factors Blimp1 and Irf4 are essential for the initial differentiation of activated B cells to antibody-secreting cells, however their function in mature plasma cells remains elusive. We have found that while Irf4 was essential for plasma cell survival, Blimp1 was dispensable. Blimp1-deficient cells retained the unique plasma cell transcriptional signature, but lost the ability to secrete antibody or to maintain the characteristic size and ultrastructure of plasma cells. Blimp1 was required for full expression of many components of the unfolded protein response (UPR), including Xbp1 and Atf6, as well as for the appropriate processing of Igh mRNA. The overlap of Blimp1 and Xbp1 function was restricted to the UPR genes, with Blimp1 uniquely regulating activity of the mTOR pathway, plasma cell size and morphology. These studies establish Blimp1 as a major regulator of the UPR pathway that is also required for the unique metabolic requirements of plasma cells enabling the secretion of protective antibody.

These responses can be stimulated by immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. anti-PD1 antibodies) and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR). Efficacy of these agents in solid tumors including colorectal cancers (CRC) is limited by immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that prevents killing of malignant cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Understanding the nature of TME-generated immunosuppression is of paramount importance. Here we report that TME elicited immunosuppression via eliminating activated CTL; this elimination required TME stress-induced downregulation of the IFNAR1 chain of type I interferon (IFN) receptor and attenuation of its signaling. Downregulation of IFNAR1 was observed in human colorectal cancers (CRC) and in mouse CRC models where it was required for efficient tumor development and progression. Stabilization of IFNAR1 on CTL improved their survival and increased anti- tumor activities of CAR T cells and PD1 inhibitors thereby providing a rationale for targeting IFNAR1 degradation for immunotherapies optimization. Two genotypes of mice were examined either 9 or 21 days post injection of MC38 colon cancer cells or MC38mRFP cells, respectively.  2-3 replicate mice were analyzed on separate arrays for each condition.  6 conditions in total were analyzed. ..

The histone variant macroH2A1 (mH2A1) is almost three times the size of its canonical H2A counterpart due to the presence of a ~25kDa evolutionarily conserved non-histone macro domain. Strikingly, mH2A1 can mediate both gene repression and activation. However, the molecular determinants conferring these alternative functions remain elusive. Here, we report that mH2A1.2 is required for the activation of the myogenic gene regulatory network and muscle cell differentiation. H3K27 acetylation at prospective enhancers is exquisitely sensitive to mH2A1.2, indicating a role of mH2A1.2 in imparting enhancer activation. Both H3K27 acetylation and recruitment of the transcription factor Pbx1 at prospective enhancers are regulated by mH2A1.2. Overall, our findings indicate a role of mH2A1.2 in marking regulatory regions for activation. To establish the role of the  histone variant mH2A1.2 in skeletal muscle differentiation we employed the mouse skeletal muscle C2C12 cell line and examined the genome wide distribution mH2A1.2  in myoblast (MB) and myotube (MT) (two replicates). We intersected the distribution of mH2A1.2 with active (H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 from published dataset, and H3K27ac, two replicates) and repressive (H3K27me3, two replicates) epigenetic marks in MB and MT. To gain insite on how  chromatin accessibility is remodelled when muscle cells are induced to differentiate, we performed  ATAC-seq in C2C12 MB and MT (2 replicates). We then evaluated whether mH2A1.2 was involved in conferring H3K27 acetylation during skeletal muscle differentiation by performing H3K27ac ChIP-seq (two replicates) upon mH2A1.2i in MB and MT. We also prefomred the ChIP-Seq for transcription factor Pbx1 in control and mH2A1.2i cells in MT to address the potential role of mH2A in recruitment of Pbx1.   RNA-seq experiments were performed in control and mH2A1.2i C2C12 cells at the stage of MB and MT (three replicates). When mH2A1.2i C2C12 MB were induced to differentiate, a global effect on transcription was observed. ..

We investigated LV structural and functional adaptation to elevated afterload in mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted NOS3 overexpression (NOS3TG) and wild type littermates (WT). Methods and Results: Hemodynamic indices, cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis were measured 10 weeks after transverse aortic constriction (TAC). After 10 weeks TAC, NOS3TG had better preserved systolic function (maximum rates of pressure development normalized to maximal pressure 77  6 versus 65  2 ms-1, P=0.05), reduced heart weight-body weight ratio (HW/BW, 5.0  0.3 versus 5.8  0.1, P<0.05), and cardiomyocyte width than WT (14.9  0.4 vs 16.7  0.2 ?m, P<0.05). After 10 weeks TAC, a 44k cDNA chip-based microarray analysis was validated using real time PCR and revealed significantly altered expression pattern of genes involved in cellular growth, matrix remodelling, and inflammation between genotypes. Conclusions: Cardiomyocyte-restricted NOS3 overexpression attenuates TAC-induced hypertrophy via autocrine inhibition of cardiomyocyte cell growth, but does not mitigate myocardial fibrosis. The subsequent diastolic dysfunction suggests that inhibition of matrix producing cells during hypertrophic stress is necessary to prevent functional and structural deterioration of the pressure-overloaded heart.

Clinically, Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related myeloproliferative neoplasias (MPN) disorders1-5 are believed to present as a precursor stage to lethal AML development. Despite the identification of cytogenetic abnormalities and increased activation of signaling in human MDS/MPN, specific pathways that either sustain or initiate disease progression and evolve into self-sustaining leukemic-initiating cells (L-ICs)13 have not been elucidated. Here we demonstrate that tissue specific loss of glycogen synthase kinase-3   (GSK3 beta  ) initiates the emergence of stable Pre-leukemic-ICs (PLIC) in vivo. In contrast to deletion or transgenic perturbation of pathways associated with AML eg.   -catenin/Wnt, serial transplantation of PL-IC produced abnormal hematological disease that phenotypically and molecularly resembles human MDS/MPN. PL-ICs were exclusively generated from GSK3 beta   deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), indicating that disease initiation events collaborate with existing HSC self-renewal machinery. In the absence of GSK3 beta  , subsequent deletion of GSK3 beta   caused rapid induction of L-ICs that give rise to lethal AML. As these processes were solely driven by dose-dependent deficiencies in GSK3 beta levels, our results suggest that perturbation of this pathway can sufficiently drive and recapitulate a step-wise progression of disease from HSCs to MDS/MPN and subsequent AML. Our study provides a molecular and cellular foundation to understand AML evolution from pre-leukemic precursors. We suggest that defining the molecular states of pre-neoplastic disease will allow patient stratification at early stages of MDS/MPN onset and aid in the development of therapeutic targeting of causal pathways responsible for the earliest stages of leukemic initiation events. 5 week post-transplanted recipient mice (CD45.1) with either Lin- bone marrow GSK3 alpha +/+ beta +/flx, alpha+/+ beta flx/flx, alpha -/- beta +/+ or  alpha-/- beta fx/flx Rosa26-CreERTM cells (CD45.2) were induced 3 times with intraperitoneal injections of Tamoxifen (75mg/kg) at intervals of two to three days.

Although Notch signaling is known to be cis-inhibited by Notch ligands expressed on the same cells, the role of Notch ligands on T cells remain unclear. In this report we demonstrate that the Notch ligand Dll1 on CD4+ T cells transduces signals required for the maintenance of activated CD4+ T cells without affecting Notch signaling in the same cells. T cell-specific Dll1-deficient (Dll1-/-) mice did not show any defect in T cell development in thymus or spleen. Co-transfer of CD4+ T cells from Dll1-/- and control mice into recipient mice followed by immunization revealed a rapid decline of CD4+ T cells from Dll1-/- mice compared with control cells. Dll1-/- mice exhibited lower clinical scores of experimental autoimmune encephalitis than control mice. The expression of Notch target genes in CD4+ T cells from Dll1-/- mice was not affected, suggesting that Dll1 deficiency in T cells does not affect cis Notch signaling. Overexpression of the intracellular domain of Dll1 in Dll1-deficient CD4+ T cells partially rescued impaired survival. Our data highlight Dll1 as an independent regulator of Notch-signaling for the survival of activated CD4+ T cells, and provide new insight into the physiological roles of Notch ligands as well as a regulatory mechanism important for maintaining adaptive immune responses The mRNA expression in activated CD4+ T cells from mouse was obtained by DNA microarray analysis.

As a result, DSBs have been proposed to promote transcriptional and, ultimately, physiological dysfunction via both cell-intrinsic and cell-non-autonomous pathways.

Derived mice were exmined for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response in adulthood, and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus was subsequently collected for gene expression analysis by next gen sequencing. Similar to what we reported previously in our paternal stress model, the majority of diffferenitally expressed genes in the PVN exhibited decreased expression, supporting that an increase of specific sperm miRs in the zygote can elicit long-term genetic reprogramming. Futher, marked changes in the expression of extracellular matrix and collagen gene sets suggested altered blood-brain barrier permeability with potential consequences for neuroendocrine function. mRNA profiling of paraventricular nucleus from adult male mice derived from zygote microinjection of nine miRs (multi-miR; miR-29, miR-30a, miR-30c, miR-32, miR-193-5p, miR-204, miR-375, miR-532-3p, miR-698) or PBS.

However, a major drawback of this technique is that microRNAs, when expressed significantly above endogenous levels, may target genes that are not affected under physiological conditions. To circumvent this problem, we have generated a retroviral microRNA-knockdown library encompassing the majority of the microRNA families expressed throughout lymphocyte development. MicroRNA knockdown is mediated by sponges, mRNAs that possess multiple binding sites for a certain microRNA family in their 3   -UTR region. MiRNA sponges function as competitive inhibitors that sequester all specific microRNA/RISC complexes, thereby de-repressing the endogenous target genes. Using this library in pre-B cells as a model system, we have characterized all microRNAs expressed in early B cells development according to their impact on processes such as apoptosis and differentiation. In doing so, we show that functional knockdown of the known tumor-suppressive miR-15 family has only slight effects under cellular steady-state conditions. Upon withdrawal of the growth factor IL-7, however, loss of miR-15 function almost completely inhibits pre-B to immature B cell differentiation, partially protects from apoptosis and enables prolonged proliferation. In correspondence with that, knockdown of the miR-15 family confers a competitive advantage in suboptimal IL-7 concentrations, indicating that levels of miR-15 determine the sensitivity of cells towards growth factor receptor signaling. Moreover, IL-7 withdrawal seems to increase the activity of endogenous miR-15 family members in pre-B cells. Using microarray analysis, we have identified cyclin E1 as a direct and cyclin D3 as an indirect putative target gene of the miR-15 family in B cell precursors. Exogenous expression of cyclin E1 or cyclin D3 recapitulates the miR-15 loss-of-function phenotype in B cell precursors, validating their biological importance. Together, this suggests that the miR-15 family functions as a central element in a positive feedback loop that reinforces cell-cycle arrest at low growth factor concentrations, which is considered a prerequisite for light chain gene recombination and differentiation. Gene expression in cells expressing a scrambled sponge as a control vector or a sponge designed to sequester all members of the miR-15 family (miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-497, miR-195, miR-322) was measured either in the presence or 36 hours after withdrawal of the growth factor IL-7.

The primary translational control arm of the UPR is initiated by the PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2  , leading to a large-scale reprogramming of translation and subsequent activation of an ATF4-mediated transcriptional program. It has remained challenging, however, to accurately evaluate the contribution of each component of the eIF2  /ATF4 pathway to the remodelling of transcription and translation. Here, we have used mouse embryonic fibroblasts containing either a knock-in of the non-phosphorylatable eIF2   S51A mutant or knock-out for ATF4 by ribosome profiling and mRNA-seq to define the specific contributions of eIF2   phosphoryation and ATF4 in controlling the translational and transcriptional components of the UPR. These studies show that the transcriptional and translational targets of each P-eIF2  , ATF4, and the other UPR gene expression programs overlapped extensively, leading to a core set of UPR genes whose robust expression in response to ER stress is driven by multiple mechanisms. The identification of other, more factor-specific targets illustrated the potential for functional specialization of the UPR. As the UPR progressed temporally, cells employed distinct combinations of transcriptional and translational mechanisms, initiated by different factors, to adapt to ongoing stress. These effects were accompanied by a buffering effect where changes in mRNA levels were coupled to opposing changes in ribosome loading, a property which makes cooperation between transcription and translation essential to confer robust protein expression.

Methods: Th17 mRNA profiles of 48hrs in vitro cultured T helper 17 cells from wild-type mice were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HighSeq. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows   Wheeler Aligner (BWA) and TopHat followed by CuffDiff. qRT   PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays.  Results: Among the 3444 RefSeq non-coding RNAs and 46449 NONCODE non-coding RNAs, 2533 were found to be expressed in Th17 cells (FPKM>1). 210 of them were enriched in DDX5 pull-down and 119 of them were enriched in RORgt pull-down.

We find that one microRNA, microRNA-218, is highly enriched and abundantly expressed in motoneurons.  Furthermore, we find that miR-218 is transcribed from alternative, motoneuron-specific alternative promoters embedded within the Slit2 and Slit3 genes by performing RNA sequencing of FACS-isolated motoneurons and a dissected embryonic floor plate cells which served as a control.  Next, we performed RNA sequencing of FACS-isolated wild type (WT) motoneurons and motoneurons lacking miR-218 expression (218DKO motoneurons), and find that a large set of genes (named 'TARGET218' genes) with predicted miR-218 binding sites are de-repressed in the absence of miR-218 expression.  Finally, we examine the expression of TARGET218 genes in other neuronal subpopulations by FACS-isolating  V1, V2a, and V3 interneurons expressing Cre-inducible fluorescent reporters and performing RNA sequencing.  We find that the TARGET218 network of genes is depleted in wild-type motoneurons versus these interneuron types.  Additionally, these genes are expressed at similar levels in 218DKO motoneurons compared with interneuron subtypes, suggesting that this genetic network.

Here, we demonstrate that the AML maintenance function of BRD4 requires its interaction with NSD3, which belongs to a subfamily of H3K36 methyltransferases. Unexpectedly, AML cells were found to only require a short isoform of NSD3 that lacks the methyltransferase domain. We show that NSD3-short is an adaptor protein that sustains leukemia by linking BRD4 to the CHD8 chromatin remodeler, by using a PWWP chromatin reader module, and by employing an acidic transactivation domain. Genetic targeting of NSD3 or CHD8 mimics the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of BRD4 inhibition. Furthermore, BRD4, NSD3, and CHD8 colocalize across the AML genome, and each is released from super-enhancer regions upon chemical inhibition of BET bromodomains. These findings suggest that BET inhibitors exert therapeutic effects in leukemia by evicting BRD4-NSD3-CHD8 complexes from chromatin to suppress transcription.

Here we show that GC treatment of mouse and human macrophages initiates a cascade of induced gene expression including many anti-inflammatory genes. Inducible binding of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was detected at candidate enhancers in the vicinity of induced genes in both species and this was strongly associated with canonical GR binding motifs.

In a therapeutic perspective, a renewable source of functional GABAergic INs is needed. Here, we identified five factors (Foxg1, Sox2, Ascl1, Dlx5 and Lhx6) able to convert fibroblasts directly into induced GABAergic INs (iGABA-INs), displaying the molecular signature of telencephalic INs. The selected factors recapitulate in fibroblasts the activation of transcriptional networks required for the specification of GABAergic fate during telencephalon development. iGABA-INs exhibited progressively maturing firing patterns comparable to those of cortical INs, had synaptic currents and released GABA. Importantly, upon grafting in the hippocampus, iGABA-INs survived, matured and their optogenetic stimulation triggered GABAergic transmission and inhibited the activity of connected granule cells. The five factors also converted human cells into functional GABAergic neurons. These properties define iGABA-INs as a promising tool for disease modeling and cell-based therapeutic approaches.

The preB-cell receptor (preBCR) is an important checkpoint of B-cell development and essential for a preB-cell to traverse into an immature B-cell. Here, we show that activation of Mef2 transcription factors by preBCR is necessary for initiating the subsequent genetic network. We demonstrate that B-cell development is blocked at the preB-cell stage in mice deficient for Mef2c and Mef2d transcription factors and that preBCR signaling enhances the transcriptional activity of Mef2c/d through phosphorylation by the ERK5 mitogen activating kinase. This activation is instrumental in inducing Kr  ppel-like factor 2 and several immediate early genes of the AP1 and Egr family. Finally, we show that Mef2 proteins cooperate with the products of their target genes (Irf4 and Egr2) to induce secondary waves of transcriptional regulation. Our findings uncover a novel role for Mef2c/d in coordinating the transcriptional network that promotes early B-cell development.

The down-regulation of all three TET genes and loss-of-function mutations of TET2 have been frequently observed in various cancers, and it was thought that they all play tumor-suppressor roles in tumorigenesis. Here we show that TET1 is likely a direct target of MLL and significantly up-regulated in MLL-rearranged leukemia, associated with an increased level of 5hmC. Our further in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that Tet1 plays an indispensable oncogenic role in MLL-rearranged leukemia, through cooperating with MLL fusion proteins in regulating their co-targets including the Hoxa/Meis1/Pbx3/Flt3 genes. Our data delineate a MLL-fusion/Tet1/Hoxa/Meis1/Pbx3/Flt3 signaling axis in MLL-rearranged leukemia, and highlight TET1 as a potential therapeutic target in treating this presently therapy-resistant disease.

In this study, we found that the chemical reprogramming process requires the early formation of extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN)-like cells and a late transition from XEN-like cells to CiPSCs, a new route that differs from the pathway of transcription factor-induced reprogramming. Moreover, by more precisely manipulating the cell fate transition in a step-wise manner through the XEN-like state, we identified small-molecule boosters and established a robust chemical reprogramming system, with a yield up to 1,000-fold greater than that of the previously reported protocol.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of palmitate on the transcriptomic profile of mouse C2C12 myoblasts. Global gene expression was evaluated using whole mouse genome oligonucleotide microarrays, and the results were validated through real-time PCR. A total of 4047genes were identified as differentially expressed, including 3492 down-regulated and 555 up-regulated genes during 48-h-exposure to palmitate (0.1 mmol/l). Functional classification showed the involvement of PA-regulated genes in several processes which regulate cell growth. In conclusion, palmitate modifies the expression of genes associated with: i) myoblast responsiveness to hormones and growth factors, ii) cytokine and growth factor expression, and iii) regulation of cell-cell cell-matrix communication. Such alterations can affect myoblast growth and differentiation, however further studies in this field are required. To whom the correspondence should be addressed: Dr K.

At the molecular level, the acquisition and maintenance of memory requires changes in chromatin modifications. In an effort to unravel the epigenetic network underlying both short- and long-term memory, we examined chromatin modification changes in two distinct mouse brain regions, two cell-types, and three time-points before and after contextual learning. Here we show that histone modifications predominantly change during memory acquisition and correlate surprisingly little with changes in gene expression. While long-lasting changes are almost exclusive to neurons, learning-related histone modification and DNA methylation changes occur also in non-neuronal cell types, suggesting a functional role for non-neuronal cells in epigenetic learning. Finally, our data provides evidence for a molecular framework of memory acquisition and maintenance, wherein DNA methylation could alter the expression and splicing of genes involved in functional plasticity and synaptic wiring.

Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or polarized in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic differentiation conditions. Computational analysis reveals a spectrum of cellular states in vivo, including a self-renewal state, Th1-like effector/memory states and a dysfunctional/senescent state. Relating these states to in vitro differentiated Th17 cells, unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four novel genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity, and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.

Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) has been associated with tissue remodeling and is highly expressed in failing hearts.  To test if inhibition of CTGF would alter the course of cardiac remodeling and preserve cardiac function in the protein kinase C   (PKC  ) mouse model of DCM.  Transgenic mice expressing constitutively active PKC   in cardiomyocytes develop cardiac dysfunction that was evident by 3 months of age, and that progressed to heart failure, cardiac fibrosis, and increased mortality.  Beginning at 3 months of age, mice were treated with an antibody to CTGF (FG-3149) or non-immune IgG control antibody for an additional 3 months.  CTGF inhibition significantly improved left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in PKC   mice, and slowed the progression of LV dilatation.  Using gene arrays and quantitative PCR, the expression of many genes associated with tissue remodeling were elevated in PKC   mice, but significantly decreased by CTGF inhibition, however total collagen deposition was not attenuated.  The observation of significantly improved LV function by CTGF inhibition in PKC   mice suggests that CTGF inhibition may benefit patients with DCM. Total RNA was isolated from the left ventricle of 6-month-old PKC   transgenic mice or nontransgenic FVB/N controls 3 months after initiation of treatment with IgG (n=10 biological replicates each) or anti-CTGF antibody FG-3149 (n=12 each) and hybridized to Affymetrix 430A 2.0 microarrays.

Although the physiological mechanism of ductal secretion is known, its transcriptional control is not well characterized. Here, we investigate the role of the transcription factor Hematopoietically-expressed homeobox protein (Hhex) in pancreatic secretion and pancreatitis. Methods: We derived mice with pancreas-specific, Cre-mediated Hhex gene ablation to determine the requirement of Hhex in the pancreatic duct in early life and in adult stages. Histological and immunostaining analyses were used to detect the presence of pathology. Pancreatic primary ductal cells (PDCs) were isolated to discover differentially expressed transcripts upon acute Hhex ablation. Results: Hhex protein was detected throughout the embryonic and adult ductal trees. Ablation of Hhex in pancreatic progenitors resulted in postnatal ductal ectasia associated with acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, a progressive phenotype that ultimately resulted in chronic pancreatitis. Hhex ablation in adult mice, however, did not cause any detectable pathology. Ductal ectasia did not result from perturbations in primary cilia, but was consistent with the effects of primary ductal hypertension. RNA-seq analysis of Hhex-ablated PDCs indicated the G-protein coupled receptor Natriuretic peptide receptor 3, implicated in paracrine signaling, was upregulated 4.70-fold. Conclusions: Although Hhex is dispensable for adult pancreatic function, ablation of Hhex in pancreatic progenitors results in profound pancreatitis that is consistent with primary ductal hypertension. Our data highlight the critical role of paracrine signaling in maintaining ductal homeostasis, especially in early life, and support ductal hypersecretion as a novel etiology of pediatric chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic primary ductal cells (PDCs) were isolated from uninduced adult HhexL/L;Sox9CreERT2 (n=2) and littermate control HhexL/L (n=2) mice. PDCs were treated with 500nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen in vitro for 4 days, and then RNA was collected for transcriptome analysis. ..

In this study, we have identified a sub cell line of 4T1, designated as 4T1-Sapporo (4T1-S), which could induce a strong immune response against the same line. When 4T1-S was subcutaneously injected, striking enlargement of draining lymph nodes and increase of activated T cells were observed. The strong immune responses could not be observed when 4T1-S was injected to nude mice, indicating that this phenomenon is mediated by T cell response.

Overexpression of EZH2 is commonly observed in human epithelial cancers, such as non- small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), yet definitive demonstration of malignant transformation by deregulated EZH2 has proven elusive. Here, we demonstrate the causal role of EZH2 overexpression in NSCLC with a new genetically-engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Deregulated EZH2 silences normal developmental pathways leading to epigenetic transformation independent from canonical growth factor pathway activation. As such, tumors feature a transcriptional program distinct from KRAS- and EGFR-mutant mouse lung cancers, but shared with human lung adenocarcinomas exhibiting high EZH2 expression. To target EZH2-dependent cancers, we developed a novel and potent EZH2 inhibitor that arises from a facile synthesis and possesses improved pharmacologic properties. JQEZ5 promoted the regression of EZH2-driven tumors in vivo, confirming oncogenic addiction to EZH2 in established tumors and providing the rationale for epigenetic therapy in a defined subset of lung cancer.

As it is believed that proper Treg function is compromised under inflammatory conditions, exploring a pathway that enhances Treg function is of great importance. In this study, we report that IL-27, an IL-12 family cytokine known to play both pro- and anti-inflammatory role in T cells, plays a pivotal role in Treg function to control T cell-induced colitis. Unlike WT Tregs capable of inhibiting colitogenic T cell expansion and inflammatory cytokine expression, IL-27R-deficient Tregs were unable to downregulate inflammatory T cell responses. Tregs stimulated with IL-27 expressed substantially enhanced suppressive function both in vitro and in vivo. IL-27 stimulation of Tregs induced expression of LAG3, a surface molecule implicated in negatively regulating immune responses. LAG3 expression in IL-27-stimulated Tregs was critical to mediate suppressive Treg function. Finally, human Tregs also displayed enhanced suppressive function and LAG3 expression in response to IL-27 stimulation. Taken together, our results highlight a novel function of the IL-27/LAG3 axis in Treg regulation of inflammatory responses in the intestine. FACS purified Foxp3+ Tregs were stimulated in the presence of media or IL-27 to compare IL-27 induced gene profiles. Four samples (media stimulated or IL-27-stimulated) were collected from four independent experiments. Genes altered by IL-27 treatment were compared to those of media stimulated Tregs. .. regulatory T cells;  total RNA;  regulatory T cells;  10090;  Mus musculus;  rIL-27 (10ng/ml);

SSCs express key OSKM reprogramming factors at some levels, and do not require ectopic expression of any gene for the acquisition of pluripotency during reprogramming to mSSCs. Therefore, we reasoned that additional factors are required to regulate SSC reprogramming. In this study, we first compared the expression of reprogramming signature genes among somatic cells, iPSC, SSCs, mSSCs, and partially reprogramed cells, and found that they appear to have similar pluripotency states, whereas their transcriptional program differs. We developed a systems biology approach to prioritise genes for pluripotency regulatory factors by integrating transcriptome and interactome data on the genome-wide functional network. Then, we performed a series of systematic gene prioritisation steps and identified 53 candidates, which included some known reprogramming factors. We experimentally validated one particular candidate, Positive cofactor 4 (Pc4), which was expressed in PSCs and yielded a positive RNA interference (RNAi) response in an Oct4 reporter assay. We demonstrated that Pc4 enhanced the efficiency of OSKM-mediated reprogramming by promoting the transcriptional activity of key pluripotency factors, and by regulating the expression of many protein- and miRNA-encoding genes involved in reprogramming and somatic cell-specific genes. Pc4-overexpressing mESC lines were established by Venus (YFP)-expressing lentiviral transfection. The mESCs were split at a density of 2    104 cells onto fresh MEF feeder cells seeded into a 6 well dish (containing mESC growth medium) with virus particles, and 25   g/ml polybrene (Sigma Aldrich) was added.

Genetically encoded voltage indicators may be particularly attractive for minimal invasive and repeated assessments of cardiac excitation from the cellular to the whole heart level.   Objective: To test the hypothesis that cardiomyocyte-targeted voltage-sensitive fluorescence protein 2.3 (VSFP2.3) can be exploited as optogenetic tool for the monitoring of electrical activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and the whole heart as well as function and maturity in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes.   Methods and Results: We first generated mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted expression of VSFP2.3 and demonstrated distinct sarcolemmal localization of VSFP2.3 without any signs for associated pathologies (assessed by echocardiography). Optically recorded VSFP2.3 signals correlated well with membrane voltage measured simultaneously by patch-clamping. The utility of VSFP2.3 for human action potential recordings was confirmed by simulation of immature and mature action potentials in murine VSFP2.3 cardiomyocytes. Optical cardiograms (OCGs) could be monitored in whole hearts ex vivo and minimally invasively in vivo via fiber optics at physiological heart rate (10 Hz) and under pacing-induced arrhythmia. Finally, we reprogrammed tail-tip fibroblasts from transgenic mice and used the VSFP2.3 sensor for benchmarking functional and structural maturation in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.  Conclusions: We introduce a novel transgenic voltage-sensor model as a new method in cardiovascular research and provide proof-of-concept for its utility in optogenetic sensing of physiological and pathological excitation in mature and immature cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo.

Molecular and cellular processes for energy-sensing and elevated neuronal output are critical for understanding the central nervous system response to energy deficit states, such as during weight-loss. Cell type-specific transcriptomics can be used to identify pathways that counteract weight-loss but, in adult mice, this has been limited by technical challenges. We report high-quality gene expression profiles of AGRP neurons under well-fed and energy deficit states. For comparison, we also analyzed POMC neurons, an intermingled population that suppresses appetite. This data newly identifies cell type-selective involvement of signaling pathways, ion channels, neuropeptides, and G-protein coupled receptors. Combined with methods to validate and manipulate these pathways, this resource greatly expands molecular insight into neuronal regulation of body weight, and may be useful for devising therapeutic strategies for obesity and eating disorders.

We performed a comprehensive epigenomic analysis of the pancreatic    cell, key player in glucose homeostasis and diabetes, in adolescent and very old mice. Globally, we observe a general methylation drift resulting in an overall more leveled methylome, suggesting that the maintenance of highly differential methylation patterns becomes compromised with advanced age. Importantly, we discover targeted changes in the methylation status of    cell proliferation and function genes that go against the global methylation drift, are specific to    cells, and correlate with repression of the proliferation program and activation of metabolic regulators. These targeted alterations frequently occur at distal cis-regulator elements, and are associated with specific chromatin marks and transcription factor occupancy in young    cells. Strikingly, we find the insulin secretory response to glucose much improved in mature    cells in mice, as predicted by the changes in methylome and transcriptome and in contrast to the decline in function observed in aged human    cells. Thus, aging of terminally differentiated cells in mammals is not always coupled to functional decline.

Here we provide an integrated analysis of p53 genomic occupancy and p53-dependent gene regulation in the splenic B and non-B cell compartments of mice exposed to whole-body ionizing radiation, providing insight into general principles of p53 activity in vivo. In unstressed conditions, p53 bound few genomic targets; induction of p53 by ionizing radiation increased the number of p53 bound sites, leading to highly overlapping profiles in the different cell types. Comparison of these profiles with chromatin features in unstressed B cells revealed that, upon activation, p53 localized at active promoters, distal enhancers, and a smaller set of unmarked distal regions. At promoters, recognition of the canonical p53 motif as well as binding strength were associated with p53-dependent transcriptional activation, but not repression, indicating that the latter was most likely indirect. p53-activated targets constituted the core of a cell type-independent response, superimposed onto a cell type-specific program. Core response genes included most of the known p53-regulated genes, as well as many new ones. Our data represent a unique characterization of the p53-regulated response to ionizing radiation in vivo.

However, the precise functions of WNT/beta-catenin signaling in this context remain unknown. Using mutant mice, primary ventral midbrain (VM) cells and pluripotent stem cells (mouse embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells), we show that Dickkopf 3 (DKK3), a secreted glycoprotein that modulates WNT/beta-catenin signaling, is specifically required for the correct differentiation of a rostrolateral mdDA precursor subset into SNc DA neurons. Dkk3 transcription in the murine VM coincides with the onset of mdDA neurogenesis and is required for the maintenance of LMX1A and consequently PITX3 expression in rostrolateral mdDA precursors, without affecting the proliferation or specification of their progenitors. Treatment of primary VM cells or differentiating pluripotent stem cells with recombinant WNT1 and/or DKK3 proteins consistently increases the proportion of mdDA cells with SNc DA neuron identity and promotes their survival in vitro. The SNc DA pro-differentiation and pro-survival properties of DKK3, together with its known anti-tumorigenic effect, therefore make it an ideal candidate for the improvement of regenerative and neuroprotective strategies in the treatment of PD. We performed gene expression microarray analysis on iPSC-derived and FACS-sorted GFP-positive Pitx3GFP/+ mdDA neurons, differentiated in the presence or absence of recombinant human WNT1 and recombinant human DKK3.

The sources of RAG1 mistargeting and the mechanisms that have evolved to suppress it are poorly understood.  Here, we report the surprising finding that RAG1 binds to thousands of sites in the genome of developing lymphocytes, primarily at active promoters and enhancers.  The genome has responded by reducing the abundance of "cryptic" recombination signals near sites of RAG1 binding. This depletion operates specifically on the RSS heptamer, with nonamers enriched at RAG1 binding sites.  Reversing this RAG-driven depletion of cleavage sites by insertion of strong recombination signals creates an ectopic hub of RAG-mediated V(D)J recombination and chromosomal translocations.  Our findings delineate rules governing RAG binding in the genome, identify areas at risk of RAG-mediated damage, and highlight the evolutionary struggle to accommodate programmed DNA damage in developing lymphocytes.

Mammalian cells cannot synthesize essential amino acids; they must obtain these amino acids via specific transporters. Glutamine, though a non-essential amino acid, is critical for tumor cells (glutamine addiction). Entry of amino acids into tumor cells is enhanced by upregulation of specific transporters. If the transporters that are specifically induced in tumor cells are identified, blockade of the induced transporters would constitute a logical strategy for cancer treatment. The transporter SLC6A14 is unique and transports all essential amino acids as well as glutamine and is expressed only at low levels in normal tissues, but induced in colon cancer and in ER+ breast cancer. We have now established the potential of this transporter as a drug target for breast cancer treatment using genetic and pharmacologic approaches.

Cleaved fragments are subsequently degraded by the cellular mRNA degradation machinery.  Here, we reveal that mammalian cells respond to this widespread cytoplasmic mRNA decay by altering levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription in the nucleus.  Measurements of both RNAPII recruitment to promoters and nascent mRNA synthesis revealed that the majority of affected genes are transcriptionally repressed in SOX-expressing cells. The transcriptional feedback does not occur in response to the initial endonuclease-induced cleavage, but instead to degradation of the cleaved fragments by cellular exonucleases.  In particular, Xrn1 catalytic activity is required for transcriptional repression. Notably, viral mRNA transcription escapes decay-induced repression, and this escape requires Xrn1.  Collectively, these results indicate that mRNA decay rates impact transcription in mammalian cells, and that gamma-herpesviruses have incorporated this feedback mechanism into their own gene expression strategy. NIH 3T3 cells were mock, WT, or    HS infected with MHV68 in duplicate and 4sU-labeled RNA isolated. 4sU-labeled RNA was submitted for sequencing and reads aligned to the mouse genome or MHV68 viral genome.

These observations suggest a selection process for defining tumor initiating cells. Here we use quantitative mRNA- and miR-Seq to determine the impact of HRasG12V on the transcriptome of keratinocytes. We discover that microRNA-203 is downregulated by HRasG12V. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of microRNA-203 promotes selection and expansion of tumor-initiating cells. Conversely, restoration of microRNA-203 with an inducible model potently inhibits proliferation of these cells. We comprehensively identify microRNA-203 targets required for HRas-initiated tumorigenesis. These targets include important effectors of the Ras pathway and essential genes required for cell division. Together, this study establishes a role for the loss of microRNA-203 in promoting selection and expansion of HRas mutated cells and identifies a mechanism through which microRNA-203 antagonizes HRas-mediated tumorigenesis.

We previously determined that CBF    (encoded by CBFB) is important for the transforming activity of the chimeric protein AML1-ETO (RUNX1-RUNX1T1) generated by the t(8;21), and other studies showed that normal Runx1 functions are essential for survival and maintenance of some leukemias lacking RUNX1 or CBFB mutations. Thus, we hypothesized that we could achieve therapeutic efficacy in multiple leukemias by targeting the Runx1:CBF   interaction with small molecule inhibitors. Using the structure of the DNA binding Runt domain (RD) of Runx1 and its interface with CBF  , we employed a computational screen of a library of 78,000 drug-like compounds, and further optimized our initial hits. The Runt domain inhibitors (RDIs) bind directly to the RD and disrupt its interaction with CBF  . These tool compounds reduced growth and induced apoptosis of t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, and reduced the progenitor activity of mouse and human leukemia cells harboring the t(8;21), but not normal bone marrow cells. The RDIs had similar effects on murine and human T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines that did not harbor the t(8;21) A murine T-ALL cell line 720, derived from Tcf12+/- mouse expressing a Tal1 transgene under the control of the Lck promoter, was especially sensitive to the inhibitors.

Here we define at nucleotide resolution the divergent transcription start sites (TSSs) near mouse mRNAs. We find that coupled sense and anti-sense TSSs form the boundaries of an evolutionarily conserved and nucleosome-depleted regulatory region with dramatically enriched transcription factor (TF) occupancy. Notably, as the distance between sense and anti-sense TSSs increases, so does the level of TF binding and signal-dependent gene activation. We further discover a cluster of anti-sense TSSs in macrophages with an enhancer-like chromatin signature. Remarkably, this signature identifies promoters that are selectively and rapidly activated during immune challenge. We conclude that anti-sense TSSs can serve as potent, local enhancers of sense-strand gene expression by facilitating TF binding and deposition of activating histone modifications.

Here we show that Rev-erb  modulates the clock and metabolism by different genomic mechanisms. Clock control requires Rev-erb  to bind directly to the genome at its cognate sites, where it competes with activating ROR TFs. By contrast, Rev-erb  regulates metabolic genes primarily by recruiting the HDAC3 corepressor to sites to which it is tethered by cell type-specific transcription factors.  Thus, direct competition between Rev-erb  and ROR TFs provides a universal mechanism for self-sustained control of molecular clock across all tissues, whereas Rev-erb  utilizes lineage-determining factors to convey a tissue-specific epigenomic rhythm that regulates metabolism tailored to the specific need of that tissue.

Here, using both molecular and genome-wide next generation sequencing methods, we report that neuronal activity stimulation triggers the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in the promoters of a subset of early-response genes, including Fos, Npas4, and Egr1. Generation of targeted DNA DSBs within Fos and Npas4 promoters is sufficient to induce their expression even in the absence of an external stimulus. Activity-dependent DSB formation is likely mediated by the type II topoisomerase, Topoisomerase IIb (Topo IIb), and knockdown of Topo IIb attenuates both DSB formation and early response gene expression following neuronal stimulation. Our results suggest that DSB formation is a physiological event that rapidly resolves topological constraints to early-response gene expression in neurons.

We identify mitochondrial dysfunction in xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA), a nucleotide excision DNA repair disorder with severe neurodegeneration, in silico and in vivo. XPA deficient cells show defective mitophagy with excessive cleavage of PINK1 and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. The mitochondrial abnormalities appear to be caused by decreased activation of the NAD+-SIRT1-PGC-1   axis triggered by hyperactivation of the DNA damage sensor PARP1. This phenotype is rescued by PARP1 inhibition or by supplementation with NAD+ precursors that also rescue the lifespan defect in xpa-1 nematodes. Importantly, this pathogenesis appears common to ataxia-telangiectasia and Cockayne syndrome, two other DNA repair disorders with neurodegeneration, but absent in XPC, a DNA repair disorder without neurodegeneration. Our findings reveal a novel nuclear-mitochondrial cross-talk that is critical for the maintenance of mitochondrial health. Mice carrying WT, or CX (Csa-/-/Xpa-/-) alleles in a C57BL/6 background were maintained under standard laboratory conditions and allowed free access to water and control casein pelleted diet (Research Diets D12450B). At 3 months of age, 3 replicates of each of the CX and WT mice were given subcutaneous interscapular injections of 500 mg of Nicotinamide riboside/kg body weight/day or the equivalent volume of saline for 14 consecutive days at 4:00 pm.  On day 15, the mice were sacrificed and half of the cerebellum was harvested for purification of mitochondria, with the left half snap-frozen, homogenized, and aliquoted for RNA isolation.

GM-CSF myeloid dendritic cells (GM-DCs) secrete several cytokines including IL-2 upon activation by pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) ligands. DC IL-2 has been shown to be important for innate and adaptive immune responses, however its importance in DC physiology has never been demonstrated. This is due to ambiguity in expression of the CD122 subunit of the IL-2 trimeric receptor complex crucial for signaling. We show here that autocrine IL-2 signaling is functional in GM-DCs in early time window of stimulation with PAMPs. IL-2 signaling selectively activates the JAK/STAT5 pathway by assembling holo-receptor complexs at the cell surface. Autocrine IL-2 signaling inhibits survival of PAMP matured GM-DCs which is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Our findings suggest immune regulation by a novel autocrine signaling pathway that can potentially be exploited in DC immunotherapy. Microarray technology was used to understand the role of IL-2 signaling in DC. Microarray was performed to investigate the role of IL-2 signaling in DC physiology.

Ascorbic Acid had a cardiogenic effect in mESC CGR8 cell line. Transcriptome of AA-treated CGR8 ESCs did not reveal any significant changes in gene expression as compared to untreated cells. We performed a global gene expression analysis to better understand the mechanism of Ascorbic acid-induced cardiac differentiation.

Treg populations are defined by expression of the oligomeric transcription factor FOXP3 and inability to produce IL-2, a cytokine required for T cell maintenance and survival. FOXP3 activity is regulated post-translationally by histone/protein acetyltransferases and histone/protein deacetylases (HDACs). Here, we determined that HDAC3 mediates both the development and function of the two main Treg subsets, thymus-derived Tregs and induced Tregs (iTregs). We determined that HDAC3 and FOXP3 physically interact and that HDAC3 expression markedly reduces Il2 promoter activity. In murine models, conditional deletion of Hdac3 during thymic Treg development restored Treg production of IL-2 and blocked the suppressive function of Tregs. HDAC3-deficient mice died from autoimmunity by 4-6 weeks of age; however, injection of WT FOXP3+ Tregs prolonged survival. Adoptive transfer of Hdac3-deficient Tregs, unlike WT Tregs, did not control T cell proliferation in naive mice and did not prevent allograft rejection or colitis. HDAC3 also regulated the development of iTregs, as HDAC3-deficient conventional T cells were not converted into iTregs under polarizing conditions and produced large amounts of IL-2, IL-6, and IL-17. We conclude that HDAC3 is essential for the normal development and suppressive functions of thymic and peripheral FOXP3+ Tregs.

However, how the genome-wide binding patterns of these regulators are modulated during B-lineage development remains to be determined. Here, we found that in lymphoid progenitors the chromatin remodeler Brg1 specified the B cell fate. In committed pro-B cells Brg1 regulated Igh locus contraction and controlled c-Myc expression to modulate the expression of genes that regulate ribosome biogenesis. In committed pro-B cells Brg1 also suppressed a pre-B lineage-specific pattern of gene expression.

Na  ve DRG neurite outgrowth on myelin was very limited, but preconditioning the neurons by a prior sciatic nerve crush increased axonal growth substantially across all strains, with by far the greatest change in neurons from CAST/Ei mice.  Three independent in vivo CNS injury models revealed greater capacity for CNS axonal regeneration in CAST/Ei than C57BL/6 mice.  Full-genome expression profiling of na  ve and pre-conditioned DRGs across all strains revealed Activin-  A (Inhba) as the transcript whose expression most closely correlated with axonal growth on myelin.  In vitro and in vivo gain- and loss-of-function experiments confirmed that Activin promotes axonal growth in the CNS.  Substantial regeneration is possible, therefore, in the injured mammalian CNS when Activin signaling is intrinsically high, as in CAST/Ei or when extrinsically modulated in other strains. 9 strains, 4 replicates per strain, 2 conditions (na  ve and axotomy) = 72 samples. 2 samples were excluded because technical outliers (AJ_AX5D_1 and AJ_NAIVE_4 excluded from the normalized data but included in the raw data) .. total RNA;  129  AX5D  replicate 1;  129  AX5D  replicate 2;  129  AX5D  replicate 3;  129  AX5D  replicate 4;  129  NAIVE  replicate 1;  129  NAIVE  replicate 2;  129  NAIVE  replicate 3;  129  NAIVE replicate  4;  AJ  AX5D  replicate 3;  AJ  AX5D  replicate 4;  AJ  AX5D replicate  2;  AJ  NAIVE  replicate 1;  AJ  NAIVE  replicate 2;  AJ  NAIVE  replicate 3;  C3H  AX5D  replicate 1;  C3H  AX5D  replicate 2;  C3H  AX5D  replicate 3;  C3H  AX5D replicate  4;  C3H  NAIVE  replicate 2;  C3H  NAIVE  replicate 3;  C3H  NAIVE  replicate 4;  C3H  NAIVE replicate  1;  C57  AX5D  replicate 1;  C57  AX5D  replicate 3;  C57  AX5D  replicate 4;  C57  AX5D replicate  2;  C57  NAIVE  replicate 1;  C57  NAIVE  replicate 2;  C57  NAIVE  replicate 3;  C57  NAIVE replicate  4;  CAST  AX5D  replicate 1;  CAST  AX5D  replicate 4;  CAST  AX5D replicate  2;  CAST  AX5D replicate  3;  CAST  NAIVE  replicate 1;  CAST  NAIVE  replicate 2;  CAST  NAIVE  replicate 3;  CAST  NAIVE replicate  4;  DBA  AX5D  replicate 1;  DBA  AX5D  replicate 2;  DBA  AX5D  replicate 3;  DBA  AX5D  replicate 4;  DBA  NAIVE  replicate 1;  DBA  NAIVE  replicate 2;  DBA  NAIVE  replicate 3;  DBA  NAIVE replicate  4;  NOD  AX5D  replicate 1;  NOD  AX5D  replicate 2;  NOD  AX5D  replicate 3;  NOD  AX5D  replicate 4;  NOD  NAIVE  replicate 1;  NOD  NAIVE  replicate 2;  NOD  NAIVE  replicate 3;  NOD  NAIVE replicate  4;  NZO  AX5D  replicate 1;  NZO  AX5D  replicate 2;  NZO  AX5D  replicate 3;  NZO  AX5D  replicate 4;  NZO  NAIVE  replicate 3;  NZO  NAIVE  replicate 4;  NZO  NAIVE replicate  1;  NZO  NAIVE replicate  2;  WSB  AX5D  replicate 1;  WSB  AX5D  replicate 2;  WSB  AX5D  replicate 4;  WSB  AX5D replicate  3;  WSB  NAIVE  replicate 2;  WSB  NAIVE  replicate 3;  WSB  NAIVE  replicate 4;  WSB  NAIVE replicate  1;  129;  AJ;  C3H;  C57;  CAST;  DBA;  NOD;  NZO;  WSB;  10090;  Mus musculus;  dorsal root ganglion;  AX5D;  NAIVE;  Total RNA was extracted from na?ve and injured DRGs (6 DRGs per sample, 3 mice) across 9 strains and assessed with the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

Transcriptional network analysis on transformed cells revealed up-regulation of genes involved in three signaling pathways: Wnt signaling, cell cycle and focal adhesion with the gene Spp1, also known as osteopontin (OPN) serving as a key node connecting these three pathways. Inhibition of OPN blocked the formation of aggregated neurospheres, affected the proliferative capacity of transformed cell-types and reduced the expression levels of neural stem cell markers. Specific inhibition of OPN in murine glioma tumors prolonged mice survival. We conclude that OPN is an important player in dedifferentiation of cells during tumor formation, hence its inhibition can be a therapeutic target for glioblastoma.

We hypothesized that human susceptibility genes can be identified on the basis of conserved molecular mechanisms in rodent brains. We used a short-term cocaine-dependent conditioned place preference (CPP) to identify genetic hallmarks of early steps of reward memory in basal ganglia including accumbens nucleus (NAc), globus pallidus (GP) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Using genome-wide microarray analysis and CPP as a quantitative trait, we found that synaptic plasticity-related genes are deregulated in these three structures. A significant enrichment in bona fide transcripts involved in dendritic spine local translation was evidenced. mGluR5 is transcriptionally deregulated in Acc and GP of cocaine-treated animals.

Furthermore, Orexin/Hcrt transcript level is decreased in STN, a region known to be involved in discriminating addictive drugs and natural rewards.

Altogether, these results suggest that a combined deregulation of mGluR5 and Grin3A pathway in NAc, mGluR5 in GP and orexin system in STN may generate an incentive memory contrasted between addictive drugs and natural rewards.

We hypothesized that human susceptibility genes can be identified on the basis of conserved molecular mechanisms in rodent brains. We used a short-term cocaine-dependent conditioned place preference (CPP) to identify genetic hallmarks of early steps of reward memory in basal ganglia including accumbens nucleus (NAc), globus pallidus (GP) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). Using genome-wide microarray analysis and CPP as a quantitative trait, we found that synaptic plasticity-related genes are deregulated in these three structures. A significant enrichment in bona fide transcripts involved in dendritic spine local translation was evidenced. mGluR5 is transcriptionally deregulated in Acc and GP of cocaine-treated animals.

Here, we show that Brd4 chromatin occupancy in acute myeloid leukemia closely correlates with the hematopoietic transcription factors (TFs) Pu.1, Fli1, Erg, C/EBP  , C/EBP  , and Myb at nucleosome-depleted enhancer and promoter regions. We provide evidence that these TFs, in conjunction with the lysine acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP, facilitate Brd4 recruitment to their occupied sites to promote transcriptional activation. Moreover, chemical inhibition of BET bromodomains is found to suppress the functional output each hematopoietic TF, thereby interfering with essential lineage-specific transcriptional circuits in this disease. These findings reveal a chromatin-based signaling cascade comprised of hematopoietic TFs, p300/CBP, and Brd4, which supports leukemia maintenance and is suppressed by BET bromodomain inhibition.

Here we apply genetic lineage tracing for endogenous Nanog, Oct4 and X chromosome reactivation during OSKM induced trans-differentiation, as these molecular events mark final stages for acquisition of induced pluripotency. Remarkably, the vast majority of reprogrammed cardiomyocytes or neural stem cells derived from mouse fibroblasts via OSKM mediated trans-differentiation were attained after transient acquisition of pluripotency, and followed by rapid differentiation. Our findings underscore a molecular and functional coupling between inducing pluripotency and obtaining    trans-differentiated    somatic cells via OSKM induction, and have implications on defining molecular trajectories assumed during different cell reprogramming methods. poly RNA-Seq was measured before, during and after conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to neural stem cells using OSKM trans-differentiation method. .. total RNA;  Mouse Fibroblasts;  day 6 of OSKM-trans differentiation to neural stem cells;  embryonic stem cells;  induced pluripotent stem cells;  neural stem cells received with OSKM trans-differentiation;  primary neural stem cells;  A12 (Mbd3 flox/-);  B6/129;  BDF2;  v6.5;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Rosa26-TdTomato B6 female + Col1a-OSKM 129 male;  IES6 sample was generated by adding dox and 4OHT to the medium from day 1- 6;

During catabolic conditions, such as low nutrients, systemic inflammation, cancer or infections, protein breakdown is enhanced and aminoacids are released from muscles to sustain liver gluconeogenesis and tissues protein synthesis. Proteolysis in muscle is orchestrated by a set of genes named atrophy-related genes. A system that is activated both in short and prolonged stress conditions is the family of Forkhead Box (Fox) O transcription factors. Here, we report that muscle-specific deletion of FoxO members resulted in protection from muscle loss because FoxO family is required for induction of autophagy-lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome systems. Importantly, FoxOs are required for Akt activity but not for mTOR signalling underlining the concept that FoxOs are upstream mTOR for the control of protein breakdown when nutrients are lacking. Moreover, FoxO family controls the induction of critical genes belonging to several fundamental stress response pathways such as unfolded protein response, ROS detoxification and translational regulation. Finally, we identify a set of novel FoxO-dependent ubiquitin ligases including the recent discovered MUSA11 and a new one, which we named Specific of Muscle Atrophy and Regulated by Transcription (SMART). Our findings identify the critical role of FoxO in regulating a variety of genes belonging to pathways important for stress-response under catabolic conditions. Gene expression in muscles of muscle-specific FoxO 1,3,4 knock-out mice that were fed normally or starved We generated knocked-out FoxO 1,3,4 specifically in muscle by crossing FoxO1-3-4-floxed mice (FoxO1,3,4 f/f) with a transgenic line expressing Cre recombinase under the control of MLC1f promoter to generate muscle-specific FoxO1,3,4 triple knockout mice. These mice were either fed ad libitum or starved. Subsequently gene expression of the gastrocnemius muscles was analyzed.For each of the 4 conditions (FOXO1,3,4 f/f fed or starved, FOXO1,3,4-/- fed or starved), we isolated the gastrocnemius muscles of 3 mice thus yielding 6 muscles per condition.RNA was prepared from these muscles using the TRIzol method (Life Technologies) followed by cleanup with the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry and quality of the RNA was monitored using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA of the 6 muscles per condition was pooled equimolarly and used for further microarray analysis. cRNA was prepared, labelled and hybridised to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays using Affymetrix-supplied kits and according to standard Affymetrix protocols.

Prevention of neural degeneration and subsequent disability requires remyelination through the generation of new oligodendrocytes, but current treatments exclusively target the immune system. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are stem cells in the central nervous system and the principal source of myelinating oligodendrocytes. These cells are abundant in demyelinated regions of patients with multiple sclerosis, yet fail to differentiate, thereby representing a cellular target for pharmacological intervention. To discover therapeutic compounds for enhancing myelination from endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, we screened a library of bioactive small molecules on mouse pluripotent epiblast stem-cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Here we show seven drugs function at nanomolar doses selectively to enhance the generation of mature oligodendrocytes from progenitor cells in vitro. Two drugs, miconazole and clobetasol, are effective in promoting precocious myelination in organotypic cerebellar slice cultures, and in vivo in early postnatal mouse pups. Systemic delivery of each of the two drugs significantly increases the number of new oligodendrocytes and enhances remyelination in a lysolecithin-induced mouse model of focal demyelination. Administering each of the two drugs at the peak of disease in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis results in striking reversal of disease severity. Immune response assays show that miconazole functions directly as a remyelinating drug with no effect on the immune system, whereas clobetasol is a potent immunosuppressant as well as a remyelinating agent. Mechanistic studies show that miconazole and clobetasol function in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase and glucocorticoid receptor signalling, respectively. Furthermore, both drugs enhance the generation of human oligodendrocytes from human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in vitro. Collectively, our results provide a rationale for testing miconazole and clobetasol, or structurally modified derivatives, to enhance remyelination in patients.

Transforming growth factor    (TGF  ) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is activated by RT and inhibits the antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells and the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that TGF   hinders the ability of RT to promote anti-tumor immunity. Development of tumor-specific immunity was examined in a pre-clinical model of metastatic breast cancer. Mice bearing established 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma treated with pan-isoform specific TGF   neutralizing antibody, 1D11, showed significantly improved control of the irradiated tumor and non-irradiated metastases, but no effect in the absence of RT. Notably, whole tumor transcriptional analysis demonstrated the selective upregulation of genes associated with immune-mediated rejection only in tumors of mice treated with RT+TGF   blockade. Mice treated with RT+TGF   blockade exhibited cross-priming of CD8+ T cells producing IFN   in response to three tumor-specific antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which was not evident for single modality treatment. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in mouse tumors showed a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells only in mice treated with the combination of RT+TGF   blockade. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells abrogated the therapeutic benefit of RT+TGF   blockade. These data identify TGF   as a master inhibitor of the ability of RT to generate an in situ tumor vaccine, which supports testing inhibition of TGF   during radiotherapy to promote therapeutically effective anti-tumor immunity. We used genome-wide microarray to depict main biological processes responsibles for the therapeutic benefit of the combination ofTGF-beta blockade and local radiotherapy. To gain a more comprehensice protrait of the effects of RT and TGFbeta blockade on gene expressionin tumors, we collected 4T1 tumors 4 days after completion of RT.

To identify genes regulated by NF90-NF45, we performed comprehensive analyses of mRNA expression in quadriceps of wild-type (WT) and NF90-NF45 dbTg mice. mRNA expression profile in quadriceps comparing WT and NF90-NF45 dbTg mice. .. 16 weeks;  17-18 weeks;  female;  male;  NF90-NF45 dbTg;  wild type;  total RNA;  NF90-NF45 dbTg mouse, quadriceps;  WT mouse, quadriceps;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Quadriceps;

We show here that complete inactivation of the Fbxl10 gene leads to dense de novo methylation only of the promoters that are co-occupied by both FBXL10 and by Polycomb Repressive Complexes; this results in pervasive defects in embryonic development and death of homozygous Fbxl10 mutant embryos at midgestation. Deletion of key components of Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 did not lead to ectopic de novo methylation. These results indicate that FBXL10 defends Polycomb-occupied promoters against ectopic de novo methylation. FBXL10 is the first reported factor whose loss leads to a gain in genomic DNA methylation.

Analyses of mouse mutants harboring deletions of core components have implicated PRC2 in fine-tuning multiple pathways that instruct HSPC behavior, yet how PRC2 is targeted to specific genomic loci within HSPCs remains unknown. Here we use shRNA-mediated knockdown to survey the function of known PRC2 accessory factors in HSPCs by testing the competitive reconstitution capacity of transduced murine fetal liver cells. We find that similar to the phenotype observed upon depletion of core subunit Suz12, depleting Jarid2 enhances the competitive transplantation capacity of both fetal and adult, mouse and human HSPCs. Gene expression profiling revealed common Suz12 and Jarid2 target genes that are enriched for the H3K27me3 mark established by PRC2. These data implicate Jarid2 as an important component of PRC2 that has a central role in coordinating HSPC function.

Resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors by partial hepatectomy (PHx) is associated with promoting hepatocarcinogenesis. We have previously reported that PHx promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in the Mdr2-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mouse, a model for inflammation-mediated HCC. Now, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor-promoting effect of PHx in these mice. Methods. Using microarrays-based techniques, we compared genomic and transcriptomic profiles of HCC tumors developing in the Mdr2-KO mice either spontaneously or following PHx. Results. PHx accelerated HCC development in these mice by four months. PHx-induced tumors had only amplifications affecting multiple chromosomes and locating mainly near the acrocentric centromeres of murine chromosomes. Four different chromosomal regions were amplified each in at least three tumors. All tumors of untreated mice had chromosomal aberrations, including both deletions and amplifications. Comparison of gene expression profiles revealed a significantly enriched expression of oncogenes, chromosomal instability markers and E2F1 targets in the post-PHx compared to spontaneous tumors. Both tumor groups shared the same frequent amplification at chromosome 18. Here, we demonstrated that one of the regulatory genes encoded by this amplified region, Crem, was over-expressed in the nuclei of murine and human HCC cells in vivo, and that it stimulated proliferation of human HCC cells in vitro. Conclusions:  PHx of a chronically inflamed liver directed tumor development to a discrete pathway characterized by amplification of specific chromosomal regions and expression of specific tumor-promoting genes. Crem is a new candidate HCC oncogene frequently amplified in this model and frequently over-expressed in human HCC. To explore the mechanisms of the accelerated HCC development by PHx, we compared liver tumors and their matched non-tumor liver tissues between 9-month-old hepatectomized and 13-14-month-old untreated Mdr2-KO mice.

We report strand-specific RNAome sequencing that determines expression of small and large RNAs from ribosomal RNA-depleted total RNA in a single sequence run. Since current analysis pipelines cannot reliably analyze small and large RNAs simultaneously, we developed TRAP, Total Rna Analysis Pipeline, a robust interface that is also compatible with existing RNA sequencing protocols. RNAome sequencing quantitatively preserved all RNA classes, allowing cross-class comparisons that facilitates the identification of relationships between different RNA classes. We demonstrate the strength of RNAome sequencing in mouse embryonic stem cells treated with cisplatin. MicroRNA and mRNA expression in RNAome sequencing significantly correlated between replicates and was in concordance with both existing RNA sequencing methods and gene expression arrays generated from the same samples.  Moreover, RNAome sequencing also detected additional RNA classes such as enhancer RNAs, anti-sense RNAs, novel RNA species and numerous differentially expressed RNAs undetectable by other methods. At the level of complete RNA classes, RNAome sequencing also identified a specific global repression of the microRNA and microRNA isoform classes after cisplatin treatment whereas all other classes such as mRNAs were unchanged. These characteristics of RNAome sequencing will significantly improve expression analysis as well as studies on RNA biology not covered by existing methods. 8 mouse embryonic stem cell samples, 4 control and 4 cisplatin treated, 4 replicates per group for Affymetrix arrays.

The use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) has resulted in the birth of more than 5 million children. While children conceived by these technologies are generally healthy, there is conflicting evidence suggesting an increase in adult-onset complications like glucose intolerance and high blood pressure in IVF children. Animal models indicate similar potential risks. It remains unclear what molecular mechanisms may be operating during in vitro culture to predispose the embryo to these diseases. One of the limitations faced by investigators is the paucity of the material in the preimplantation embryo to test for molecular analysis. To address this problem, we generated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) from blastocysts conceived after natural mating  (mESCFB) or after IVF, using optimal (KSOM + 5% O2; mESCKAA) and suboptimal (Whitten   s Medium, + 20% O2, mESCWM) conditions.

Muscle activity leads to major swings in mitochondrial [Ca2+] which control aerobic metabolism, cell death and survival pathways. We have investigated in vivo the effects of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle function and trophism, by overexpressing or silencing the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU). The results coherently demonstrate that both in developing and in adult muscles MCU-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has a marked trophic effect that does not depend on autophagy or aerobic control, but impinges on two major hypertrophic pathways of skeletal muscle, PGC-1  4 and Igf1-Akt/PKB. In adult mice, MCU overexpression protects from denervation-induced atrophy. These data reveal a novel Ca2+-dependent organelle-to-nucleus signaling route, which links mitochondrial function to the control of muscle mass and may represent a possible pharmacological target in sarcopenia. Experiments were performed on biological replicates of single skeletal muscle fibres. Seven fibres were chosen for their Mutochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU) overexpression and other seven fibres because MCU was silenced.

Genome sequencing of lung tumors from patients with Squamous Cell Carcinoma has identified SMAD4 to be frequently mutated. Here we used a novel mouse model to determine the molecular mechanisms regulated by loss of Smad4 which lead to lung cancer progression. Mice with ablation of Pten and Smad4 in airway epithelium developed metastatic adenosquamous tumors. Comparative transcriptomic and in vivo cistromic analyses determined that loss of PTEN and SMAD4 resulted in activation of the ELF3 and the ErbB2 pathway due to decreased ERRFI1   s expression, a negative regulator of ERBB2 in mice and human cells. The combinatorial inhibition of ErbB2 and Akt signaling attenuated tumor progression and cell invasion, respectively. Expression profiles analysis of human lung tumors substantiated the importance of the ErbB2/Akt/ELF3 signaling pathway as both prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic drug targets for treating lung cancer.

Here, we analyze the transcriptomes of distinct progenitor subpopulations isolated by a novel approach from developing mouse and human neocortex. We identify 56 genes preferentially expressed in human apical and basal radial glia that lack mouse orthologs. Among these, ARHGAP11B has the highest degree of radial glia-specific expression. ARHGAP11B arose from partial duplication of the Rho GTPase-activating-protein   encoding ARHGAP11A on the human lineage after separation from the chimpanzee lineage. Expression of ARHGAP11B in embryonic mouse neocortex promotes basal progenitor generation and self-renewal, and can increase cortical plate area and induce gyrification. Hence, ARHGAP11B may have contributed to evolutionary expansion of human neocortex.

Recent studies showed that YAP stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival. However, the direct transcriptional targets through which YAP exerts its effects are poorly defined.   Methods and Results   To identify genes directly regulated by YAP in cardiomyocytes, we combined differential gene expression analysis in YAP gain- and loss-of-function with genome-wide identification of YAP bound loci using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing. This screen identified Pik3cb, encoding p110  , a catalytic subunit of phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), as a candidate YAP effector that promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival. We validated YAP and TEAD occupancy of a conserved enhancer within the first intron of Pik3cb, and show that this enhancer drives YAP-dependent reporter gene expression. Yap gain- and loss-of-function studies indicated that YAP is necessary and sufficient to activate the PI3K-Akt pathway. Like Yap, Pik3cb gain-of-function stimulated cardiomyocyte proliferation, and Pik3cb knockdown dampened the YAP mitogenic activity. Reciprocally, Yap loss-of-function impaired heart function and reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival, all of which were significantly rescued by AAV-mediated Pik3cb expression.   Conclusion   Pik3cb is a crucial direct target of YAP, through which the YAP activates PI3K-AKT pathway and regulates cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival.

C12 activated apoptosis in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from both wild type (WT) and Bax/Bak double knock-out mice (WT MEF and DKO MEF that were responsive to C12, DKOR  MEF): nuclei fragmented; mitochondrial membrane potential (     mito) depolarized; Ca2+  was released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), increasing cytosolic [Ca2+] (Cacyto); caspase 3/7 was activated. DKOR  MEF had been isolated from a nonclonal pool of DKO MEF that were non-responsive to C12 (DKONR  MEF). RNAseq analysis, qPCR and western blots showed that WT and DKOR  MEF both expressed genes associated with cancer, including paraoxonase 2 (PON2), while DKONR  MEF expressed little PON2. Adenovirus-mediated expression of human PON2 in DKONR  MEF rendered them responsive to C12:      mito  depolarized, Cacyto  increased and caspase 3/7 activated. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells expressed low levels of endogenous PON2, and these cells were also less responsive to C12. Overexpression of PON2, but not PON2-H114Q (no lactonase activity) in HEK293T cells caused them to become sensitive to C12. Because [C12] may reach high levels in biofilms in lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, PON2 lactonase activity may control      mito, Ca2+  release from the ER and apoptosis in CF airway epithelia. Coupled with previous data, these results also indicate that PON2 uses its lactonase activity to prevent Bax- and Bak-dependent apoptosis in response to common proapoptotic drugs like doxorubicin, staurosporine but activates Bax- and Bak-independent apoptosis in response to C12.

Although pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) reportedly mediate HSPC activation, how HSPCs detect pathogen invasion in vivo remains elusive. Bacteria use the second messenger bis-(3   -5   )-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) for a variety of activities. Here we report that c-di-GMP comprehensively regulates both HSPCs and their niche cells through an innate immune sensor, STING, thereby inducing entry into the cell cycle and mobilization of HSPCs, while decreasing the number and repopulation capacity of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs). Furthermore, we show that type I IFN acts as a downstream target of c-di-GMP to inhibit HSPC expansion in the spleen, while  TGF-  1 is required for c-di-GMP-dependent splenic HSPC expansion. Our results define novel machinery underlying dynamic regulation of HSPCs and their niches during bacterial infection through c-di-GMP/STING signaling. Ten-week-old mice were intraperitoneally administered PBS or 200 nmol c-di-GMP, and CD150+ CD41- CD48- CD34- Flt3- LSK cells of pooled bone marrow from 10 mice per group were sorted 3 days later. mRNA was then extracted using RNeasy micro (Qiagen). Likewise, CD45- Ter-119- CD31- CD140a+ CD51+ MSCs and CD45- Ter119- CD31+ endothelial cells from c-di-GMP-treated or untreated mice were sorted and mRNA was extracted. cDNA was synthesized from mRNA and hybridized to gene chip Mouse60k (Agilent Technologies) and expression levels analyzed. .. 10 week old;  Ctrl;  cdG;  EC;  HSC;  MSC;  Male;  total RNA;  EC cdG group;  EC control group;  HSC cdG group;  HSC control group;  MSC cdG group;  MSC control group;  C57BL/6J;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Bone marrow;  Mice were treated with PBS (Ctrl) or 200nmol c-di-GMP (cdG) and cells were collected after 3 days of injection;

Transcriptome-wide examination of RNA isoforms, abundance and translation in HuR-deficient B cells, together with direct measurements of HuR-RNA interaction,  revealed that HuR-dependent mRNA splicing affects hundreds of transcripts including the dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (Dlst), a subunit of the aketoglutaratedehydrogenase (aKGDH) enzyme. In the absence of HuR, defective mitochondrial metabolism results in high levels of reactive oxygen species and B cell death.

This idea has been conceptualized in the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis (DOHaD).     In addition, there is evidence that such early-programmed phenotypes can be transmitted to the following generation(s). It is proposed that, environmentally induced, transmission of disease risk is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of this study was to determine whether patterns of gene expression in the first generation offspring are also present in the following generation offspring, via the paternal lineage. Paternal transmission of patterns of gene expression strongly suggest epigenetic inheritance of disease risk.Liver tissue was obtained from the follwing experimental groups: a) control male mice, b) adult male mice previously exposed to 50% caloric restriction in utero (IUGR), c) adult male mice overfed during lactation (ON), d) adult male offspring from control mice, e) adult male offspring from IUGR mice and f) adult male offspring from ON mice.RNA was extracted and processed for further hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays (GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)). .. total RNA;  Mus musculus whole liver tissue;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  adult male mice overfed during lactation (ON);  adult male mice previously exposed to 50% caloric restriction in utero (IUGR);  adult male offspring from IUGR mice;  adult male offspring from ON mice;  control male mice;  Animals were sacrificed, liver tissue was excised and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation.;

Therefore it is of vital importance to elucidate the key Wnt target genes in intestinal cells in vivo. We have used a novel inducible cre-lox based murine system (designated ApcFlox) to investigate the consequences of perturbation of Wnt signalling following inactivation of Apc in vivo within 100% of the intestinal epithelium. We have employed microarray analysis at 3 time points within our ApcFlox system (Day 3 prior to the onset of phenotype, day 4 the establishment of the phenotype and day 5 gross phenotype of altered proliferation, differentiation and migration) and from adenomas arising in the ApcMin/+ background allowing us characterise Wnt/beta-catenin target genes based on their expression profiles during different stages of intestinal tumourigenesis. Furthermore, we have employed microarray analysis using livers from our ApcFlox system and have demonstrated that there is very little overlap in the Wnt target genes induced by Apc loss in the liver and the intestine. More importantly, we have been able to determine a novel set of putative Wnt/beta-catenin target genes which are upregulated at both early and late stages of tumourigenesis in the intestine and may represent novel therapeutic targets in colon cancer. Samples were collected from Genetcially modified mice of the genotypes indicated on the sample records. Where appropriate, gene recombination was induced using IP administration of beta-napthoflavone.

GLP and G9a are major H3K9 dimethylases, and are essential for mouse early embryonic development. Here we report that GLP and G9a possess intrinsic histone methylation propagating activities. The histone methyltransferase activities of GLP and G9a are stimulated by neighboring nucleosomes pre-methylated at H3K9. These stimulation events function in cis and are dependent on H3K9 methylation binding activities of ankyrin repeats domains in GLP and G9a. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) harboring a mutant GLP lacking H3K9 methylation propagating activity, pluripotent genes display a delayed kinetics in establishing H3K9 methylation and gene silencing during differentiation. Disruption of the H3K9 methylation propagating activity of GLP in mice causes growth retardation of the embryos, ossification defects of calvaria and early postnatal lethality. We propose that GLP    s ability to rapidly propagate H3K9 methylation is required for efficient gene silencing during programmed cell fate transition.

The reason for this sexual dimorphism (SD) is unknown, but may reflect negative selection of Y chromosome (ChrY) bearing sperm during spermatogenesis or male fetuses early in the course of conception/pregnancy. Previously, we showed that the SD in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is associated with copy number variation (CNV) in ChrY multicopy genes. Here, we test the hypothesis that CNV in ChrY multicopy genes influences the paternal parent-of-origin effect on EAE susceptibility in female mice.  We show that C57BL/6J consomic strains of mice possessing an identical ChrX and CNV in ChrY multicopy genes exhibit a female biased sex-ratio and sperm head abnormalities, consistent with X-Y intragenomic conflict arising from an imbalance in CNV between homologous ChrX:ChrY multicopy genes. These males also display paternal transmission of EAE to female offspring and differential loading of miRNAs within the sperm nucleus. These findings provide evidence for a genetic mechanism at the level of the male gamete that contributes to the SD in EAE and paternal parent-of-origin effects in female mice, raising the possibility that a similar mechanism may contribute to the SD in MS.

The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of global gene expression profiles of the developing kidney precursors. Those gene expression data provides insights into not only the stage specific marker genes but also the signals working in each population, which should be informative for the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in vitro. Osr1-GFP knock-in mice were used to isolate kidney precursor cells from embryos at E8.5, E9.5 and E11.5.

Knowing the broad range of molecular targets of omega-3 fatty acids, microarray analysis was used to open-mindedly evaluate the effects of DHA on aorta gene expression in LDLR-/- mice and better understand its local anti-atherogenic action . Mice were fed an atherogenic diet and received daily oral gavages with oils rich in oleic acid or DHA. Bioinformatics analysis of microarray data first identified inflammation and innate immunity as processes the most affected by DHA supplementation within aorta. More precisely, several down-regulated genes were associated with the inflammatory functions of macrophages (e.g. CCL5, CCR7), cell movement (e.g. ICAM-2, SELP, PECAM-1), and the major histocompatibility complex (e.g. HLA-DQA1, HLA-DRB1). Interestingly, the expression of several genes were identified as specifc biomarkers of macrophage polarization and their changes suggested a preferential orientation towards a M2 reparative phenotype. This observation was supported by the upstream regulator analysis highlighting the involvment of three main regulators of macrophage polarization, namely PPAR   (z-score=2.367, p=1.50x10-13), INF   (z-score=-2.797, p=2.81x10-14) and NF  B (z-score=2.360, p=6.32x10-9). Moreover, immunohistological analysis of aortic root revealed an increased abundance of Arg1 (+111%, p=0.01), a specific biomarker of M2 macrophage.The present study showed for the first time that DHA supplementation during atherogenesis is associated with protective modulation of inflammation and innate immunity pathways within aorta putatively through the orientation of plaque macrophages towards a M2 reparative phenotype.

Here, we demonstrate multi-level organizations of genetic landscape, candidate genes, and molecular networks associated with 328 stress and sleep traits in a chronically stressed population of 338 (C57BL/6J  A/J) F2 mice. We constructed striatal gene co-expression networks, revealing functionally and cell-type-specific gene co-regulations important for stress and sleep. Using a composite ranking system, we identified network modules most relevant for 15 independent phenotypic categories, highlighting a mitochondria/synaptic module that links sleep and stress. The key network regulators of this module are overrepresented with genes implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases. Our work suggests the interplay between sleep, stress, and neuropathology emerge from genetic influences on gene expression and their collective organization through complex molecular networks, providing a framework to interrogate the mechanisms underlying sleep, stress susceptibility, and related neuropathology.

Embryonic piRNAs consist of both primary and secondary species and are mainly directed toward transposons. In meiotic cells, however, the piRNA population is transposon-poor and restricted to primary piRNAs derived from pachytene piRNA clusters1-6. The mechanism controlling which piRNAs are present at each developmental stage is poorly understood. Here we show that RNF17 shapes adult meiotic piRNA content by suppressing the production of secondary piRNAs. In the absence of RNF17, ping-pong (secondary amplification) occurs inappropriately in meiotic cells     aberrantly targeting protein-coding genes and lncRNAs. Our data indicate that RNF17 comprises one component of a    refereeing    mechanism that prevents deleterious activity of the meiotic piRNA pathway by ensuring the selective loading of PIWI proteins with products of meiotic piRNA clusters.

Nucleosome remodeling occurs during somatic cell reprogramming, but it remains undetermined to what degree the re-established nucleosome organization resembles between induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We generated genome-wide nucleosome maps in mouse ESCs and in iPSCs reprogrammed from somatic cells belonging to three different germ layers using a secondary reprogramming system. Pairwise comparisons showed that the nucleosome organizations in the iPSCs, regardless of the iPSCs   tissue of origin, were nearly identical to the ESCs, but distinct to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). There is a canonical nucleosome arrangement of -1, nucleosome depletion region, +1, +2, +3, et al. nucleosomes around the transcription start sites of active genes whereas only a nucleosome occupies at silent transcriptional units. Transcription factor binding sites possessed characteristic nucleosomal architecture such that their access was governed by the rotational and translational settings of the nucleosome. Interestingly, the tissue-specific genes were highly expressed only in the parental somatic cells of the corresponding iPS cell line before reprogramming, but had a similar expression level in the all resultant iPSCs and ESCs. The re-established nucleosome landscape during nuclear reprogramming provides a conserved setting for accessibility of DNA sequences in mouse pluripotent stem cells. No persistent residual expression program or nucleosome positioning of the parental somatic cells that reflected their tissue of origin were passed onto the resulting mouse iPSCs.

We set out to address this issue and map the landscape of gene expression variability in PSCs by single-cell expression profiling of PSCs under different chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that signaling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression in PSCs, with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signaling pathways and chromatin regulators. Strikingly, either removal of mature miRNAs or pharmacologic blockage of external signaling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency regulatory network, increased self-renewal efficiency, and a distinct chromatin state, an effect mediated by the action of opposing miRNA families on the c-myc / Lin28 / let-7 axis.

The cellular response to ER stress involves complex transcriptional and translational changes, important to the survival of the cell. ER stress is a primary cause and a modifier of many human diseases. A first step to understanding how the ER stress response impacts human disease is to determine how the transcriptional response to ER stress varies among individuals. The genetic diversity of the eight mouse Collaborative Cross (CC) founder strains allowed us to determine how genetic variation impacts the ER stress transcriptional response. We used tunicamycin, a drug commonly used to induce ER stress, to elicit an ER stress response in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the CC founder strains and measured their transcriptional responses. We identified hundreds of genes that differed in response to ER stress across these genetically diverse strains. Strikingly, inflammatory response genes differed most between strains; major canonical ER stress response genes showed relatively invariant responses across strains. To uncover the genetic architecture underlying these strain differences in ER stress response, we measured the transcriptional response to ER stress in MEFs derived from a subset of F1 crosses between the CC founder strains. We found a unique layer of regulatory variation that is only detectable under ER stress conditions. Over 80% of the regulatory variation under ER stress derives from cis-regulatory differences. This is the first study to characterize the genetic variation in ER stress transcriptional response in the laboratory mouse. Our findings indicate that the ER stress transcriptional response is highly variable among strains and arises from genetic variation in individual downstream response genes, rather than major signaling transcription factors. These results have important implications for understanding how genetic variation impacts the ER stress response, an important component of many human diseases. We investigated the genetic variation in ER stress transcriptional response in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) across eight mouse strains: A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1Sv/ImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/H1LtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ. MEFs from each strain were treated with a control DMSO or ER stress-inducing drug, Tunicamycin (TM). To identify the genetic architecture underlying this genetic variation, MEFs from F1 strains were also studied. MEFs from the following F1s were evaluated: C57BL/6J X CAST/EiJ, C57BL/6J X 129S1Sv/ImJ, C57BL/6J X NOD/ShiLtJ, C57BL/6J X NZO/H1LtJ, and C57BL/6J X WSB/EiJ. Again F1 MEFS were treated with either DMSO or TM.

Here we describe an innate lymphocyte population, iCD8a cells, characterized by expression of CD8a homodimers. iCD8a cells exhibit innate functional characteristics such as the capacity to engulf and kill bacteria. Development of iCD8a cells depends on expression of interleukin-2 receptor g chain (IL-2Rgc), IL-15, and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib protein H2-T3, also known as the thymus leukemia antigen or TL. While lineage tracking experiments indicated that iCD8a cells have a lymphoid origin, their development was independent of the transcriptional suppressor Id2, suggesting these cells do not belong to the family of innate lymphoid cells. Finally, we identified cells with a similar phenotype in humans, which were profoundly depleted in newborns with necrotizing enterocolitis. These findings suggest a critical role of iCD8a cells in immune responses associated with the intestinal epithelium. Three different populations of immune cells present in the intestine epithelium of RAG-2 deficient mice were compared at the transcriptome level. These populations were defined as: a. CD45+CD8alpha+ (iCD8a cells), b. NKp46+NK1.1+ (group 1 ILC), and c.CD45+CD8alpha-CD11b+ (myeloid cells).

Results: Primary fibroblasts of the conplastic mouse strain C57BL/6J-mtALR/LTJ with a mutation at position nt4738 resulting in a single nucleotide exchange (leucine to methionine) in the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (Nd2) gene of the respiratory chain show higher enzyme activity and ATP production and lower ROS production than control fibroblasts. Furthermore, Nd2-mutant fibroblasts show a higher proliferation rate and a reduction of senescence markers. Transcriptome analysis reveals members of the p38MAPK pathway as being significantly downregulated in Nd2-mutant mice as compared with controls. In line with this, inhibition of p38MAPK with SB203580 enhanced the proliferation and  reduced cytokine secretion in senescent Nd2-mutant fibroblasts.  Conclusion: Taken together, we report Nd2 as a new mitochondrial gene with age-protective function in mice, and possibly in humans, which interferes with age-related signaling pathways.

However, cellular heterogeneity presents a significant barrier to analysis and interpretation of these datasets. The neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are an important model for studies of neuronal injury, regeneration and pain. The majority of investigators utilize a dissociated preparation of whole ganglia when studying cellular and molecular function. We demonstrate that the standard methods for producing these preparations gives a 10%-neuronal mixture of cells, with the remainder of cells constituting satellite glia and other non-neuronal cell types. Using a novel application of magnetic purification, we consistently obtain over 95% pure, viable neurons from adult tissue, significantly enriched for small diameter nociceptors expressing the voltage gated ion channel Nav1.8. Using genome-wide RNA-sequencing we compare the currently used (10% neuronal) and pure (95% nociceptor) preparations and find 920 genes enriched. This gives an unprecedented insight into the molecular composition of small nociceptive neurons in the DRG, potentially altering the interpretation of previous studies performed at the tissue level, and indicating a number of novel markers of this widely-studied population of cells. We anticipate that the ease of use, affordability and speed of this technique will see it become widely adopted, delivering a greatly improved capacity to study the roles of nociceptors in health and disease. RNA-Seq was performed for 4 biological replicates from three different groups: intact DRG, acutely dissociated DRG and magnetically-purified DRG neurons.

H3K27me3 is enriched at the promoters of a large cohort of developmental genes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Loss of H3K27me3 leads to a failure of ESCs to properly differentiate, which presents a major roadblock for dissecting the precise roles of PRC2 activity during lineage commitment. While recent studies suggest that loss of H3K27me3 leads to changes in DNA methylation in ESCs, how these two pathways coordinate to regulate gene expression programs during lineage commitment is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed gene expression and DNA methylation levels in several PRC2 mutant ESC lines that maintain varying levels of H3K27me3. We found that maintenance of intermediate levels of H3K27me3 allowed for proper temporal activation of lineage genes during directed differentiation of ESCs to spinal motor neurons (SMNs). However, genes that function to specify other lineages failed to be repressed, suggesting that PRC2 activity is necessary for lineage fidelity. We also found that H3K27me3 is antagonistic to DNA methylation in cis. Furthermore, loss of H3K27me3 leads to a gain in promoter DNA methylation in developmental genes in ESCs and in lineage genes during differentiation. Thus, our data suggest a role for PRC2 in coordinating dynamic gene repression while protecting against inappropriate promoter DNA methylation during differentiation. Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC)  lines mutant for PRC2 core components Suz12 (Suz12GT and Suz12delta) and Eed (Eednull) were subjected to in vitro directed differentiation down the spinal motor neuron lineage.

However, the specific function of these pathways in AML is unclear. To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in AML, we employed a murine model of AML harboring Mll-AF9 and NRASG12V. We found that NRASG12V enforced leukemia self-renewal gene expression signatures and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9 and MYB-dependent gene expression program. In a multiplexed analysis of RAS-dependent signaling intermediates, the leukemia stem cell compartment was preferentially sensitive to RAS withdrawal. Use of RAS-pathway inhibitors showed that NRASG12V maintained leukemia self-renewal through mTOR and MEK pathway activation, implicating these pathways as potential targets for cancer stem cell-specific therapies. Mice harboring NRASG12V/Mll-AF9 AML were treated with doxycyline to abolish NRASG12V expression.  Leukemia samples were harvested at 12 hour intervals after doxycyline treatment.

This may miss earlier changes in gene expression that are transient and/or directionally opposite to those observed later. By sampling left ventricular myocardial tissue at different time points in a mouse model of cardiomyopathy, we examined differentially expressed transcripts between non-failing controls, early-HF (2 and 3 days after cardiac insult), peak-HF (10 days) and after recovery from HF (28 days). As a results, we found that gene expression followed varying patterns:  Downregulation of metabolic pathways occurred early and was sustained into late stage-HF. In contrast, most signaling pathways undergo a complex biphasic pattern: Calcium signaling, p53, apoptosis and MAP-kinase pathways displayed a bi-directional response, declining early but rising late, while NF-  B-related transcription displayed the opposite pattern. The HF-induced transcriptomic changes were reversed after recovery at 28 days. We conclude that the myocardial transcriptome in evolving HF displays distinct and dynamic transcript clusters. Therapies targeting different phases of HF should consider these dynamic features when identifying high-value targets. Mice expressing mutated estrogen receptor-coupled Cre under transcriptional control of cardiac-specific myosin heavy chain (MerCreMer, MCM, 005650;Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were back-crossed for >10 generations with C57Bl6/J.

Here, we identify Mettl3, an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) transferase, as a regulator for terminating murine na  ve pluripotency. Mettl3 knockout pre-implantation epiblasts and na  ve embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are depleted for m6A in mRNAs and yet, are viable. However, they fail to adequately terminate their na  ve state, and subsequently undergo aberrant and restricted lineage priming at the post-implantation stage, leading to early embryonic lethality. m6A predominantly and directly reduces mRNA stability, including that of key na  ve pluripotency promoting transcripts. This study highlights a critical role for an mRNA epigenetic modification in vivo, and identifies regulatory modules that functionally influence na  ve and primed pluripotency in an opposing manner. polyA RNA-seq was measured in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embroid bodies (EBs), each in WT and in Mettl3-KO cell lines.

To do so, we have established and utilizing the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAO) mouse model, where PACAP38 (1 pmol) injection is given intracerebroventrically in comparison to a control saline (0.9% NaCl) injection, in conjunction with high-throughput DNA microarray analysis. In previous studies, we have accumulated a large volume of data (gene inventory) from the whole brain (ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres) by this approach. In our latest research, we have targeted specifically infract/ischemic core (hereafter IC) and the penumbra (hereafter P) post-PACA38 injection, for re-examining the transcriptome at 6 and 24 h post-treatment. The aim of the current study is simple     to delineate the specificity of expression and localization of differentially expressed molecular factors influenced by PACAP38. Prior to this highly expensive and time-consuming omic analysis, we checked the validity of our hypothesis and experimental strategy wherein, ischemic core and penumbra were carefully sampled and compared to the corresponding contralateral (healthy) IC and P regions at 6 and 24 h, post PACAP38 or saline injections to reveal expected differences in gene and protein expression by traditional reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses, respectively (Hori et al., 2014). Our present results using the mouse 4x44K whole genome DNA chip reveal numerous changes (   /    1.5/0.75-fold) at both 6 h (654 and 456, and 522 and 449 up- and down-regulated genes for IC and P, respectively; and 24 h (2568 and 2684, and 1947 and 1592 up- and down-regulated genes for IC and P, respectively) after PACAP38 treatment. Using bioinformatics analysis by pathway- or specific-disease-state focused gene classifications and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), these genes were functionally classified and discussed. Taken together, the DNA microarray analysis provides not only a great resource for further study, but also reinforces the importance of region-specific analyses in genome-wide identification of target molecular factors that might play a role in the neuroprotective function of PACAP38. In the present study, we used three mice each in PMCAO groups for PACAP38 and saline injections, respectively, that exhibited neurological grades G1 and G2 for the subsequent downstream analysis. Six or 24 h post-injection of PACAP38 or saline, the mice were removed from their cages, decapitated, and their brains carefully removed on ice. The right (ipsilateral; ischemic) and left (contralateral) hemispheres were dissected, and from each hemisphere the ischemic core and penumbra regions and corresponding healthy core and penumbra were carefully removed with a sterile scalpel, and placed in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes. The samples were then quickly immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80   C prior to further analysis.

The pathogenesis of these malignancies is unclear, but they are speculated to arise from common cellular origins. We explored the influence of secondary effects, like hypoxia signaling, through co-deletion of Pten and Vhl in a murine model.Methods: We used a CreER-linked keratin 18 mouse model to conditionally delete Pten, Vhl or both, evaluating the resultant tumors by histology and gene expression microarray. A cohort of human cholangiocarcinoma samples was evaluated for relationships between HIF-1a expression and clinical outcomes.Results: Both Pten deletion genotypes developed liver tumors, but with differing phenotypes. Pten deletion alone led to large, invasive tumors with widespread hepatosteatosis. Co-deletion of Pten and Vhl resulted in low tumor burden and reduced steatosis. Microarray analysis divided mouse tumors    respective genotypes by gene expression. This gene expression profile grouped a human tumor cohort according to histologic type with the Pten deletion signature aligning with hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas the Pten; Vhl deletion signature associated with cholangiocarcinomas. In a human cholangiocarcinoma cohort, we observed correlation between HIF-1a expression and overall survival.Conclusions: Pten deletion leads to tumor formation and steatosis in mouse livers. Co-deletion of Vhl and Pten resulted in lower tumor burden with gene expression profiling suggesting a switch from hepatocellular expression features to an expression profile more consistent with cholangiocarinoma. A possible relation between HIF-1a expression and increased overall survival in human cholangiocarcinoma suggests that hypoxia signaling influences tumor phenotype. reference x sample ..

Self-renewal is dependent on extrinsic niche factors but few of those signals have been identified. We show that adult mammary glands contain a Wnt-responsive cell population that is enriched for stem cells. In cell culture experiments, exposure to purified Wnt protein clonally expands mammary stem cells for many generations and maintains their ability to generate functional glands in transplantation assays. We propose here that Wnt3A treated mammary stem cells retain their stemness through the regulation of its downstream target genes. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression pattern underlying mammary stem cells response towards Wnt3A treatment and identified distinct classes of genes during this process Mammary glands from 8- to 12-week-old virgin female mice were isolated and single-cell suspension was obtained. Mammary stem cell enriched population (Lin-, CD24+, CD29hi) cells were isolated using BD FACSAria.

Here, we profiled gene expression in 12 purified populations of fetal and adult pancreatic epithelial cells representing crucial progenitor cell subsets, and their endocrine or exocrine progeny. Using probabilistic models to decode the general programs organizing gene expression, we identified co-expressed gene modules in cell subsets that revealed patterns and processes governing progenitor cell development, lineage specification, and endocrine cell maturation. Module network analysis linked established regulators like Neurog3 to unrecognized roles in endocrine secretion and protein transport, and nominated multiple candidate regulators of pancreas development. Phenotyping mutant mice revealed that candidate regulatory genes encoding transcription factors, including Bcl11a, Etv1, Prdm16 and Runx1t1, are essential for pancreas development or glucose control. Our integrated approach provides a unique framework for identifying regulatory networks underlying pancreas development and diseases like diabetes mellitus. Gene expression analysis: 12 primary cell populations from wild-type pancreas and 1 cell type from a mutant background (E15 Ngn3-null cells) pancreas (in fetal and adult stage) were purified using a combination of cell surface markers and transgenic reporters.

However, Their developmental relationships remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that different MSC populations in the developing marrow of long bones have distinct functions. Proliferative mesoderm-derived nestin- MSCs participate in fetal skeletogenesis, And lose MSC activity soon after birth. In contrast, Quiescent neural-crest-derived nestin+ Cells in the same bones preserve MSC activity, But do not generate fetal chondrocytes. Instead, They differentiate into HSC-niche-forming MSCs, Helping to establish the HSC niche by secreting Cxcl12. Perineural migration of these cells to the bone marrow requires the ErbB3 receptor. The neonatal Nestin-GFP+ PDGFR- Cell population also contains Schwann-cell precursors, But does not comprise mature Schwann cells. Thus, In the developing bone marrow HSC-niche-forming MSCs share a common origin with sympathetic peripheral neurons and glial cells, And ontogenically distinct MSCs have non-overlapping functions in endochondrogenesis and HSC niche formation.

Elevated circulating lipid levels and hepatic lipid accumulation are known risk factors for CVD. We investigated the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of the flavonoid quercetin on hepatic lipid metabolism in mice with diet induced body weight gain and hepatic lipid accumulation. Adult male mice received a high-fat diet without or with supplementation of 0.33% (w/w) quercetin for 12 weeks. Body weight gain was 29% lower in quercetin-fed mice (p<0.01), while the energy intake was not significantly different. Quercetin supplementation reduced hepatic lipid accumulation with 71% (p<0.05). 1H nuclear magnetic resonance serum lipid profiling revealed that the supplementation lowered serum lipids (p<0.0001). Global gene expression profiling of liver showed that key target genes of the transcription factor Constitutive androstane receptor (Car; official symbol Nr1i3) were regulated, in particular Cytochrome P450 2b (Cyp2b) genes. Quercetin can decrease high-fat diet induced body weight gain, hepatic lipid accumulation and serum lipid levels, which might be explained by the regulation of Cytochrome P450 genes under transcriptional control of CAR, an effect which is likely dependent on dietary background. Liver samples were obtained from 24 C57BL/6J male adult mice. All mice started with a three week adaptation phase, in which they were fed a normal-fat diet.  During the intervention of 12 weeks, the mice received a high-fat diet without (HF) or with supplementation of 0.33% (w/w) quercetin (HF-Q).

Neurological and gross morphological phenotyping of these mutant mice revealed impairment of the vestibular system. Using whole genome exome sequencing and a custom-made variant calling pipeline, we identified the causative mutation as an A->T substitution on the chromosome 2 at the position 128 in the exon 6 of jagged 1 (Jag1) gene. This introduces a premature termination codon at the position 883 of the cDNA. In humans, mutations in the JAG1 gene are associated with Alagille syndrome (ALGS1  ), a multisystem developmental disorder mainly affecting small bile ducts in the liver, but also heart, skeleton, and eyes, and occasionally also kidney or inner ears. Further examination of the Jag1K295*/+ mutant mouse line disclosed multiorgan deficiencies, such as cardiac liver congestion, bile duct hypoplasia, mild nephropathy, subvalvular hypertrophy of the right ventricle, and mild growth retardation. No skeletal abnormalities could be detected. In summary, we report a novel mouse model for Alagille syndrome, Jag1K295*/+, which resembles most of the features of the mild form of Alagille syndrome observed in patients.

We selected two strategies: the first one involving a classification by cellular process of regulated genes, and the second one taking advantage of gene expression profile over a time course of treatment. We also used two standardization methods, MAS5.0 and RMA, in order to assess their similarities and differences leading us to a better understanding of their impact on the results. In comparing expression patterns of regulated genes by E2, we observed that there are good similarities between gene expression profiles obtained by MAS5.0 and RMA. However, when the ratio between signal intensities of treatment and control is low, differences between data normalized by MAS 5.0 and RMA are more apparent, i.e. where the discrimination between biological and technical variability is the least obvious.

We investigated this relationship by comparing genomic CBP recruitment with gene expression in wild type and CBP/p300 double-knockout fibroblasts.  ChIP-seq revealed nearby CBP recruitment for 20 percent of constitutively expressed genes, but surprisingly, three-quarters of these were unaffected or slightly activated by CBP/p300 deletion. Computationally defined enhancer-promoter-units (EPUs) having a CBP peak within two kilobases of the enhancer-like element provided better predictive value, with CBP/p300 deletion attenuating expression of 40 percent of such EPU assigned constitutively expressed genes. We next examined signaling-responsive (Hypoxia Inducible Factor) gene expression and CBP recruitment, and found that 97 percent of inducible genes were within 50 kilobases of an inducible CBP peak, and 70 percent of these required CBP/p300 for full inducible expression.

TMPRSS2 is expressed highly in localized high-grade prostate cancers and in the majority of human prostate cancer metastasis. Through the generation of mouse models with a targeted deletion of Tmprss2, we demonstrate that the activity of this protease regulates cancer cell invasion and metastasis to distant organs. By screening combinatorial peptide libraries we identified a spectrum of TMPRSS2 substrates that include pro-hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). HGF activated by TMPRSS2 promoted c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and initiated a pro-invasive EMT phenotype. Chemical library screens identified a potent bioavailable TMPRSS2 inhibitor that suppressed prostate cancer metastasis in vivo. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic link between androgen-regulated signaling programs and prostate cancer metastasis that operate via context-dependent interactions with extracellular constituents of the tumor microenvironment. Custom mouse cDNA microarrays were used to measure transcript levels in microdissected anterior prostate tumors from Tmprss2+/+;TRAMP mice, Tmprss2-/-;TRAMP mice or strain-matched benign epithelium.

Despite understanding the genetic basis underlying this disease, it is still not known why motor neurons (MNs) are selectively affected by the loss of the ubiquitously expressed SMN protein. Using a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) model for severe SMA, the RNA transcript profiles (transcriptomes) between control and severe SMA (SMN2+/+;mSmn-/-) mESC-derived MNs were compared in this study using massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The MN differentiation efficiencies between control and severe SMA mESCs were similar. RNA-Seq analysis identified 3094 upregulated and 6964 downregulated transcripts in SMA mESC-derived MNs when compared against control cells. Pathway and network analysis of the differentially expressed RNA transcripts showed that pluripotency and cell proliferation transcripts were significantly increased in SMA MNs while transcripts related to neuronal development and activity were reduced. The differential expression of selected transcripts such as Crabp1, Crabp2 and Nkx2.2 was validated in a second mESC model for SMA as well as in the spinal cords of low copy SMN2 severe SMA mice.

Disruption of the microbiota during maturation by low-dose antibiotic exposure can alter host metabolism and adiposity. We now show that low-dose penicillin (LDP), delivered from birth, induces metabolic alterations and affects ileal expression of genes involved in immunity. LDP that is limited to early life transiently perturbs the microbiota, which is sufficient to induce sustained effects on body composition, indicating that microbiota interactions in infancy may be critical determinants of long-term host metabolic effects. In addition, LDP enhances the effect of high-fat diet induced obesity. The growth promotion phenotype is transferrable to germ-free hosts by LDP-selected microbiota, showing that the altered microbiota, not antibiotics per se, play a causal role. These studies characterize important variables in early-life microbe-host metabolic interaction and identify several taxa consistently linked with metabolic alterations. Male and female mice were exposed to low-dose penicillin from birth. In a second experiment, microbiota from female control and LDP mice was transferred to 3-week old female germ-free mice.

Information regarding the specific mechanisms associated with granuloma regression and the subsequent recovery events in the host liver are still limited. In this study, a murine model of schistosomiasis japonica was used to characterise the multicellular pathways occurring during liver regeneration. Schistosoma japonicum-infected C57BL/6 mice were administered with the drug praziquantel (PZQ), on a daily basis for five consecutive days to eliminate all adult parasites. The pathological changes of PZQ-treated groups after 3, 6 and 7 weeks post PZQ treatment were examined, along with the assessment of cellular infiltration to the liver. PZQ treatment significantly reduced the degree of splenomegaly, granuloma density and the collagen deposition of liver fibrosis. The infiltration of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages to the liver were as well significantly decreased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the significant up-regulation of fatty acid metabolism genes and the identification of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-  ) as the upstream regulator during the process of liver recovery. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signalling pathway that is involved primarily in the regulation of hepatic enzymes responsible for xenobiotic metabolism was as well differentially up-regulated. These findings indicate that schistosome egg-induced fibrogenesis process is reversible, and provide a better understanding of the regression mechanisms associated with hepatic schistosomiasis. These results hold important implications for the future alleviation of this and other fibrotic diseases of clinical significance. C57BL/6 murine model infected with S. japonicum were treated orally with Praziquantel (PZQ) after 7 weeks post infection to examine the hepatic regression process following drug treatment. These PZQ-treated, non PZQ-treated and uninfected mice were then euthanised at 10, 13, and 14 weeks p.i.

Recombinant-specific gram-negative pathogen Escherichia coli (Xen14) and gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (Xen29) were used to induce bacterial infection in mice at a concentration of 1    108 bacteria/100   L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Small RNA libraries generated from the serum of mice after exposure to PBS, Xen14, Xen29, and Xen14+Xen29 via the routes of subcutaneous injection (I), cut wound (C), or under grafted skin (S) were analyzed using an Illumina HiSeq2000 Sequencer. Following exposure to gram-negative bacteria alone, no differentially expressed miRNA was found in the injection, cut, or skin graft models. Exposure to mixed bacteria induced a similar expression pattern of the circulating miRNAs to that induced by gram-positive bacterial infection. Upon gram-positive bacterial infection, 9 miRNAs (mir-193b-3p, mir-133a-1-3p, mir-133a-2-3p, mir-133a-1-5p, mir-133b-3p, mir-434-3p, mir-127-3p, mir-676-3p, mir-215-5p) showed upregulation greater than 4-fold with a p-value < 0.01.

To address this, we developed CellNet, a network biology platform that determines whether engineered cells are equivalent to their target tissues, diagnoses aberrant gene regulatory networks, and prioritizes candidate transcriptional regulators to enhance engineered conversions. Using CellNet, we improved B cell to macrophage conversion, transcriptionally and functionally, by knocking down predicted B cell regulators. Analyzing conversion of fibroblasts to induced hepatocytes (iHeps), CellNet revealed an unexpected intestinal program regulated by the master regulator Cdx2. We observed functional engraftment of mouse colon by iHeps, thereby establishing their broader potential as endoderm progenitors and demonstrating direct conversion of fibroblasts into intestinal epithelium.

The mechanism by which they cause AD and their relationship to the amyloid cascade affected by genes causing early onset familial AD is unknown. Unproven hypotheses are that these LOAD genes modulate the amyloid cascade itself or downstream targets affected by this cascade.If so, it is likely that these genes and/or other genes in the same pathways may show alterations in their expression as an early consequence of misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and accumulation of amyloid   -peptides (A  ). We report that in three independent APP transgenic mouse models of AD, multiple genes in lipid and inflammation pathways show very early changes in mRNA and protein expression. Many of these changes are reversed by treatment with LXR agonists, which regulate transcription of genes in lipid/inflammation pathways, and which we have previously shown can reverse the cognitive deficits and neuropathology in Tg2756 mice. These results suggest that changes in lipid and inflammation pathways are likely to be very early consequences of APP misprocessing and A   accumulation in AD. Moreover, genetic variants within these pathways might affect risk for AD by modulating this early response. These pathways are likely to contain biomarkers of early disease and targets for therapies.

We identified two novel mast cell subsets, characterized by the differential expression of surface CD25, and by the ability to produce different cytokines and to proliferate, both in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence that functional differences between the two mast cell populations were dependent on CD25 itself, which directly modulated mast cell proliferation and responses in vivo. These effects were completely independent from IL-2 or the expression of the other chains of the high-affinity IL-2R, indicating an autonomous and previously unappreciated role for CD25 in regulating cell functions. Similar results were also obtained in dendritic cells, which are known to express CD25 but to be unresponsive to IL-2. Our findings indicate a general role for CD25 in contexts where IL-2 signaling is not involved, and may have important implications for all mast cell-related diseases, including mastocytosis, where CD25 is aberrantly expressed on pathogenic mast cells.

Strikingly, when these mice are put on a 40% calorie restricted diet they lose half as much weight as calorie restricted controls.  Our results reveal for the first time that in utero undernutrition alters metabolic physiology having a profound effect on skeletal muscle energetics and response to calorie restriction in adulthood.

Yet surprisingly little is known about the factors that drive the transcriptional reprogramming of stromal cells within tumors. We report that the transcriptional regulator Heat-Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) is activated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and is a potent enabler of malignancy.  In CAFs, HSF1 drives a transcriptional program that complements, yet is completely different from, the program it drives in adjacent cancer cells. This CAF program is uniquely structured to support the malignant potential of cancer cells in a non-cell-autonomous way and involves two central stromal signaling molecules   TGF   and stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1). As clinical confirmation, in early stage breast and lung cancer high stromal HSF1 activation is strongly associated with poor patient outcome. Thus, cancers co-opt the ancient, multifaceted survival functions of HSF1 to orchestrate malignant progression in unexpected ways that have far-reaching therapeutic implications. Gene expression data We used microarrays to examine the HSF1-dependent effect of co-culture on gene expression in cancer cells and fibroblasts.

In neuronal dendrites, local translation of mRNA provides a rapid and specific mechanism for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and might be involved in the pathophysiology of certain brain disorders. Despite the importance of dendritic mRNA translation, little is known about which mRNAs can be translated in dendrites in vivo and when their translation occurs. Here we collect ribosome-bound mRNA from the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus. We find that dendritic mRNA rapidly associates with ribosomes following a novel experience consisting of a contextual fear conditioning trial. High throughput RNA sequencing followed by machine learning classification reveals an unexpected breadth of ribosome-bound dendritic mRNAs, including mRNAs expected to be entirely somatic.

In fact, excessive proteolysis causes cachexia, accelerates disease progression and worsens life expectancy. Muscle atrophy involves a common pattern of transcriptional changes in a small subset of genes named atrophy-related genes or atrogenes. Whether microRNAs play a role in the atrophy program and muscle loss is debated. To understand the involvement of miRNAs in atrophy we performed miRNA expression profiling of mouse muscles under wasting conditions such as fasting, denervation, diabetes and cancer cachexia. We found that the miRNA signature is peculiar of each catabolic condition. We then focused on denervation and we revealed that changes in transcripts and microRNAs expression did not occur simultaneously but were shifted. Indeed, while the transcriptional control of the atrophy-related genes peaks at 3 days, the changes of miRNA expression maximised at 7 days after denervation. Among the different miRNAs, microRNA-206 and 21 were the most induced in denervated muscles. We characterized their pattern of expression and defined their role in muscle homeostasis. Indeed, in vivo gain and loss of function experiments revealed that miRNA-206 and miRNA-21 were sufficient and required for atrophy program. In silico and in vivo approaches identified the transcription factor YY1 and the translational initiator factor eIF4E3 as downstream targets of these miRNAs. Thus miRNAs are important for the fine-tuning of the atrophy program and their modulation can be a novel potential therapeutic approach to counteract muscle loss and weakness in catabolic conditions. To determine which miRNAs are relevant for the atrophic process, we performed miRNA expression profiles of muscles from different atrophic models (starvation, denervation and streptozotocin-induced diabetes). We checked whether there was a common signature of miRNA expression in different atrophying conditions and we found that every catabolic situation require a peculiar pattern of miRNA. We further focus on the condition of denervation and identified the most up-regulated miRNAs in this condition, miRNA-206 and miRNA-21. .. denervated-mice (14 days);  denervated-mice (3 days);  denervated-mice (7 days);  diabetic-mice (7 days after treatment with STZ);  starved-mice (24 h);  starved-mice (48 h);  cancer cachexia;  total RNA;  wild type;  wild-type (control);  Gastrocnemius muscle, cancer cachexia, two weeks;  Gastrocnemius muscle, control;  Gastrocnemius muscle, denervation, 14 days;  Gastrocnemius muscle, denervation, 3 days;  Gastrocnemius muscle, denervation, 7 days;  Gastrocnemius muscle, diabetes, 7 days after treatment with STZ;  Gastrocnemius muscle, starvation, 24 h;  Gastrocnemius muscle, starvation, 48 h;  CD1;  10090;  Mus musculus;  gastrocnemius muscle;  CD1 wild-type (wt) mice have been placed under the following muscle wasting conditions: 1) starvation, 2) diabetes and 3) denervation. To confirm the induction of the atrophic process in each condition, we measured in EDL the expression level of Atrogin-1, a muscle specific E3-ubiquitin ligase highly induced during atrophy. 1) To induce muscle wasting by starvation, mice were food deprived for 24 and 48 hours, with free access to water. This procedure reduced body weight by 10%, gastrocnemius muscle mass by 15% and it was accompanied by more than 20 fold increase of Atrogin-1 mRNA. 2) Insulin deficiency or insulin resistance at the level of skeletal muscle tissue also leads to the activation of the atrophic program. In order to recapitulate diabetes-associated muscle atrophy, CD1 wt mice were injected intra-peritoneally with streptozotocin. This drug is recognized and approved by the ?Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium? and causes ?-cell toxicity, resulting in primary insulin deficiency. After 7 days of an acute injection of 180 mg/Kg of Streptozotocin muscle, atrophy is already established as stated by a 4-5 fold up-regulation of atrogin-1 mRNA. 3) The absence of electrical stimulation and functional load in muscle leads to progressive atrophy. CD1 wt mice underwent sciatic denervation surgery under anaesthesia. The controlateral leg was left intact. Three different time points were analysed: 3, 7 and 14 days after surgery. Three days after surgery expression of Atrogin-1 mRNA was induce by 8?fold when compared to non-denervated muscles.;

We found that Syndecan-4 (Sdc4) and Frizzled-7 (Fzd7) form a coreceptor complex in satellite cells and that binding of the ECM glycoprotein Fibronectin (FN) to Sdc4 stimulates the ability of Wnt7a to induce the symmetric expansion of satellite stem cells. Newly activated satellite cells dynamically remodel their niche via transient high-level expression of FN. Knockdown of FN in prospectively isolated satellite cells severely impaired their ability to repopulate the satellite cell niche. Conversely, in vivo overexpression of FN with Wnt7a dramatically stimulated the expansion of satellite stem cells in regenerating muscle. Therefore, activating satellite cells remodel their niche through autologous expression of FN that provides feedback to stimulate Wnt7a signaling through the Fzd7/Sdc4 coreceptor complex. Thus, FN and Wnt7a together regulate the homeostatic levels of satellite stem cells and satellite myogenic cells during regenerative myogenesis.

In erythroid cells, LDB1 is recruited to the   -globin locus via LMO2 and is required for looping of the   -globin locus control region (LCR) to the active   -globin promoter. We show that the LDB1 dimerization domain (DD) is necessary and, when fused to LMO2 is sufficient, to completely restore LCR-promoter looping and transcription in LDB1 depleted cells. The looping function of the DD is unique and irreplaceable by heterologous dimerization domains. Dissection of the DD revealed distinct functional properties of conserved subdomains. Notably, a conserved helical region (DD4/5) is dispensable for LDB1 dimerization and chromatin looping but essential for transcriptional activation. DD4/5 is required for the recruitment of the co-regulators FOG1 and NuRD complex. Lack of DD4/5 alters histone acetylation and RNA polymerase II recruitment and results in failure of the locus to migrate to the nuclear interior as normally occurs during erythroid maturation. These results uncouple enhancer-promoter looping from nuclear migration and transcription activation and reveal new roles for LDB1in these processes.

The lack of noninvasive biomarkers of rejection remains a challenge in the accurate monitoring of deeply buried nerve allografts and precludes optimization of therapeutic intervention. This study aimed to establish the expression profile of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) during nerve allotransplantation with or without immunosuppression.  Methods. Balb/c mice were randomized into 3 experimental groups, that is, (1) untreated isograft (Balb/c     Balb/c), (2) untreated allograft (C57BL/6     Balb/c), and (3) allograft (C57BL/6     Balb/c) with FK506 immunosuppression. A 1-cm Balb/c or C57BL/6 donor sciatic nerve graft was transplanted into sciatic nerve gaps created in recipient mice. At 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 d after nerve transplantation, nerve grafts, whole blood, and sera were obtained for miRNA expression analysis with an miRNA array and subsequent validation with quantitative PCR. Male Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice (age, 10   12 weeks; weight, 30   35 g) were purchased from BioLasco (Yi-Lan, Taiwan). The Balb/c mice were randomized into 3 experimental groups: (1) untreated isograft, (2) untreated allograft, and (3) allograft with FK506 treatment. Additional Balb/c and C57BL/6 mice served as sciatic nerve isograft and allograft donors, respectively. These species of mice were selected on the basis of disparity at the MHC locus and prior experience with reciprocal rejection of grafts between these murine strains. FK506 was administered subcutaneously at 1 mg/(kg   d) throughout the experimental course, unless indicated otherwise. At 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 d after initial surgery (n = 6 animals per group at each time point), sciatic nerve grafts were harvested, and whole blood samples were obtained. Additional sham-operated mice were subjected to the same procedure, including opening of the skin and muscle layers and exposing the sciatic nerve, but without nerve transection or nerve grafting, to measure the effect of FK506 injection on the expression of circulating miRNA. To test the effect of the discontinuation of FK506 treatment on the expression of circulating miRNA, whole blood was drawn at 0, 2, 4, and 6 d after discontinuation of FK506 injection in an additional group of mice with allografts and immunosuppression for 7 d. The whole blood samples (1 mL per mouse) were collected at the indicated times in tubes containing anticoagulant. After the whole blood samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, they were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, white blood cells were slowly removed from the corresponding layers, and the serum was extracted and stored at    80  C before processing for RNA analyses. All the housing conditions and the surgical procedures, analgesia, and assessments were in accordance with national and institutional guidelines, and an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)   accredited SPF facility was used. The animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. .. male;  total RNA;  whole blood;  Balb/c;  10090;  Mus musculus;  blood;  nerve allograft and daily 1 mg/kg subcutaneous FK506 treatment for 7 days;  nerve isograft at 7 days;  __untreated;  Surgical procedures: The mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of an anesthetic cocktail consisting of 0.1 mg/g ketamine and 0.01 mg/g xylazine. The anesthetized mice were restrained in a supine position on a heated pad to maintain the body temperature at 37?C. Under aseptic conditions, with sterile povidone/iodine preparation and 70% ethanol and sterile instruments and drapes, the skin over the proximal right hindlimb was incised, and the underlying biceps femoris muscle was bluntly dissected to expose the sciatic nerve. An established mouse sciatic nerve allotransplantation model was used. In brief, 1-cm Balb/c or C57BL/6 donor sciatic nerve grafts were transplanted in reverse orientation into 0.5-cm sciatic nerve gaps created in the recipient Balb/c mice. Tension-free repair was then performed under an operating microscope with three 11?0 nylon (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) interrupted epineurial sutures under 40? magnification. The muscle was closed with 5?0 vicryl sutures, and the skin with interrupted 5?0 nylon sutures. The animals were monitored to ensure appropriate feeding and diet after surgery.;

We have recently reported on reduced numbers of the minor population of tolerogenic CD8  +CD103+ DCs in the pancreas of 5 week old pre-diabetic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice.   Aim: To analyze also the larger subset of CD11c+CD8  - DCs isolated from the pancreas of pre-diabetic NOD mice 1) for maturation and tolerance inducing molecules found abnormally expressed on CD8  +CD103+ DCs, and 2) for genome-wide gene expression to further elucidate abnormalities in underlying gene expression networks.  Methods: CD11c+CD8  - DCs were isolated from 5 week old C57BL/6 and NOD pancreas. Expression of cell surface markers including CD86, CCR5, CD11b, CD103, Clec9a, CD24 and CD200R3 were measured by FACS. Genome-wide gene expression by microarray was assessed during the steady state and after in vitro LPS stimulation.   Results: The steady state pancreatic CD11c+ CD8  - DCs during the pre-diabetic stage showed:   1) A reduced expression of several gene networks important for the prime functions of the cell, such as for cell renewal, immune stimulation and immune tolerance induction, for migration and for the provision of growth factors for beta cell regeneration. This general deficiency state was corroborated by a reduced in vivo proliferation (BrdU incorporation) of the cells and the reduced expression in FACS analysis of CD86, CCR5, CD103, Clec9a, CD24 and CD200R3 on the cells.  2) A hyper reactivity of these cells to LPS correlated with an enhanced pro-inflammatory state characterized by altered expression of a number of classical pro-inflammatory factors and cytokines.  Conclusion: The NOD CD11c+CD8  - DCs seem to be Janus-faced depending on the conditions: Deficient in steady state with reduced immune stimulation capabilities also for tolerance induction; over-inflammatory with a molecular profile suggesting a preferential stimulatory capacity for Th1 cells when encountering a Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) in the form of LPS.

The molecular mechanism underlying the development and survival of ROR  t+ ILCs is not thoroughly understood. Here we show that Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8), a scaffolding protein involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell migration, is essential for the protective immunity against Citrobacter rodentium. A comparative RNA sequencing-based analysis reveals an impaired induction of antimicrobial peptides in the colon of DOCK8-deficient mice, which correlates with high susceptibility to infection and a very low number of IL-22-producing ROR  t+ ILCs in their GI tract. Furthermore, DOCK8-deficient ROR  t+ ILCs are less responsive to IL-7 mediated signaling, more prone to apoptosis and produce less IL-22 due to a defect in IL-23-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation. Our studies reveal an unsuspected role of DOCK8 for the function, generation and survival of ROR  t+ ILCs. Control and DOCK8 KO mice were infected with 2X109 CFU of Citrobacter rodentium and day 8 post infection mice were sacrificed and their colons were harvested (n=5) .

Here, we found that the culture supernatant of apoptotic cells activated the macrophages to express anti-inflammatory genes such as NR4A and Thbs1. A high level of AMP accumulated in the apoptotic cell supernatant in a Pannexin1-dependent manner. A nucleotidase inhibitor and A2a adenosine receptor antagonist inhibited the apoptotic supernatant-induced gene expression, suggesting AMP was metabolized to adenosine by an ecto-5   -nucleotidase expressed on macrophages, to activate the macrophage A2a adenosine receptor. Intraperitoneal injection of zymosan into AdoR A2a- or Panx1-deficient mice produced high, sustained levels of inflammatory mediators in the peritoneal lavage. These results indicated that AMP from apoptotic cells suppresses inflammation as a    calm down    signal. If apoptotic cells produce    danger    or    anti-danger    signal(s), we rationalized that such signals would activate gene expression in macrophages. To investigate this possibility, we examined the effect of the culture supernatant from apoptotic cells on macrophage gene expression by using microarrays. For mouse BMDMs, bone marrow cells from female C57BL/6J mice at 8 weeks of age were cultured for more than 7 days with DMEM containing 10% FCS supplemented with mouse M-CSF. We used adherent cells as BMDMs in the study. W3 cells, mouse T cell line expressing Fas, were treated with human Fas ligand at 37  C for 30 min to induce apoptosis. The cells were then washed and re-suspended at a concentration of 1    107 cells/ml with RPMI containing 1% FCS, and further incubated for 60 min at 37  C. Following Fas ligand treatment, more than 90% of the W3 cells were Annexin V positive, and only small percentage were positive for both Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI).

Here we use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to unravel the complex transcriptional network of muscle cell plasticity centered on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor    coactivator 1   (PGC-1  ), a regulatory nexus in endurance training adaptation. By integrating data on genome-wide binding of PGC-1   and gene expression upon PGC-1   over-expression with comprehensive computational prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), we uncover a hitherto underestimated number of transcription factor partners involved in mediating PGC-1   action. In particular, principal component analysis of TFBSs at PGC-1   binding regions predicts that, besides the well-known role of the estrogen-related receptor    (ERR  ), the activator protein-1 complex (AP-1) plays a major role in regulating the PGC-1  -controlled gene program of hypoxia response. Our findings thus reveal the complex transcriptional network of muscle cell plasticity controlled by PGC-1  .

Two neural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, Ascl1 and Ptf1a, are essential for generating the correct number and sub-type of neurons in multiple regions of the nervous system.    In the dorsal spinal cord, Ascl1 and Ptf1a have contrasting functions in specifying inhibitory versus excitatory neurons. To understand how Ascl1 and Ptf1a function in these processes, we identified their direct transcriptional targets genome-wide in the embryonic mouse neural tube using ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. We show that Ascl1 and Ptf1a regulate the specification of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the dorsal spinal cord through direct regulation of distinct homeodomain transcription factors known for their function in neuronal sub-type specification. Besides their roles in regulating these homeodomain factors, Ascl1 and Ptf1a each function differently during neuronal development with Ascl1 directly regulating genes with roles in several steps of the neurogenic program including, Notch signaling, neuronal differentiation, axon guidance, and synapse formation. In contrast, Ptf1a directly regulates genes encoding components of the neurotransmitter machinery in inhibitory neurons, and other later aspects of neural development distinct from those regulated by Ascl1. Moreover, Ptf1a represses the excitatory neuronal fate by directly repressing several targets of Ascl1. Examination of the Ascl1 and Ptf1a bound sequences shows they are enriched for a common E-Box with a GC core and with additional motifs used by Sox, Rfx, Pou, and Homeodomain factors. Ptf1a bound sequences are uniquely enriched in an E-Box with a GA/TC core and in the binding motif for its co-factor Rbpj, providing two keys to specificity of Ptf1a binding. The direct transcriptional targets identified for Ascl1 and Ptf1a provide a molecular understanding for how they function in neuronal development, particularly as key regulators of homeodomain transcription factors required for neuronal sub-type specification.

We find that both complexes influence transcription by binding to promoters as well as TSS-distal enhancer regions. In contrast to flies, the MSL complex is not enriched on the X chromosome yet it is crucial for mammalian X chromosome regulation as it specifically regulates Tsix ncRNA, the major repressor of Xist lncRNA. MSL depletion leads to severely decreased Tsix expression, reduced REX1 recruitment, and consequently accumulation of Xist RNA in ESCs. The NSL complex provides additional, Tsix-independent repression of Xist by maintaining pluripotency. MSL and NSL complexes therefore act synergistically by using distinct pathways to ensure a fail-safe mechanism for the repression of X inactivation in ESCs. We have performed ChIP-seq of KANSL3, MCRS1, MOF, MSL1 and MSL2 in mouse ESCs, and KANSL3, MOF and MSL2 in NPCs, in duplicate and normalised against their inputs. We have also performed RNA-seq following knockdown of Kansl3, Mof, Msl1 and Msl2 mouse embryonic stem cells in triplicate.

However, many retro-transposons and imprinted genes are resistant to such global epigenetic reprogramming via hitherto undefined mechanisms. Here, we report that some of these sequences are immune to widespread erasure of DNA methylation in the mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) lacking de novo DNA methyltransferases. Persistence of DNA methylation at these loci in mESCs depends on the histone H3K9 methyltransferase Setdb1, as deletion of Setdb1 results in reduction of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation levels concomitant with an increase in 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC). In addition, depletion of H3K9 methyltransferase G9a leads to genome-wide reduction of DNA methylation but to a lesser extent at the above sequences. Taken together, these data reveal that Setdb1 ensures the fidelity of DNA methylation at specific loci in mESCs, which may reflect mechanisms functioning in vivo during key developmental stages.

Globally Staphylococcus aureus is the single largest mastitis pathogen and the infection can ultimately result in either subclinical or chronic and sometimes lifelong infection. In the present report we have addressed the differential inflammatory response in the mice mammary tissue during intramammary infection  and the altered epigenetic context induced by two closely related strains of S. aureus. Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analysis showed strain specific hyperacetylation at histone H3K9 and H3K14 residues. Real-time PCR and genome-wide gene expression studied showed expression of a set of proinflammatory genes and cytokines in a temporal manner. Remarkably, over expression of the genes significantly correlated with the promoter specific acetylation in these residues. Furthermore, we have identified several differentially expressed known miRNAs and 4 novel miRNAs in the S. aureus infected mice mammary tissue by small RNA sequencing. By employing these gene expression data, an attempt has been made to delineate the gene regulatory networks in the strain specific inflammatory response. Apparently, one of the isolates of S. aureus activated the NFkB signaling leading to drastic inflammatory response and induction of immune surveillance, which could lead to rapid clearance of the pathogen. The other strain repressed most of the inflammatory response, which might help in its sustenance in the host tissue. Taken together, our studies shed substantial lights to understand the mechanisms of strain specific differential inflammatory response to S. aureus infection during mastitis.

Using microarray analysis, we have identified early transcriptional Oct4 targets, including genes not previously known to interact with Oct4. Comparison of the sets of Oct4-regulated genes revealed pronounced differences among the individual cell types. Furthermore, a notable up-regulation of pluripotent markers could not be detected. In contrast, we observed a down-regulation of somatic markers specific to each cellular population. This finding suggests that Oct4 interferes with the somatic transcriptional program in a cell type-specific manner, thereby promoting an unstable epigenetic state that facilitates reprogramming rather than the direct initiation of a pluripotent gene expression network. Finally, we show that Mgarp, a gene expressed in pluripotent cells, is commonly up-regulated in all cell types after Oct4 induction. Unexpectedly, Mgarp expression decreases during the first steps of reprogramming due to a Klf4-dependent inhibition. Our data show that Oct4 counteracts Klf4 repressive activity and enhances Mgarp expression at the late stages of reprogramming. This temporal pattern of Mgarp expression is crucial for the efficient generation of iPSCs. In summary, our study provides new insights into the specific role that Oct4 plays during the early stages of reprogramming. Different somatic cell types were derived from transgenic mice containing both a tetracycline-inducible transactivator (rtTA-M2) and a tetracycline operon-controlled Oct4 expression cassette (TO) (Hochedlinger 2005, Cell 121:465-477) that were mated with GOF18-GFP mice in which the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is driven by 18 kb of the Oct4 regulatory region (Oct4-GFP) (Yoshimizu 1999, Dev Growth Differ 41:675-684), thus indicating endogenous Oct4 expression. In addition, a control neural stem cell (CtrlNSC) line was generated from transgenic mice that entail a tetracycline-inducible transactivator (irtTA-VP16-GBD) (Anastassiadis 2002, Gene 298:159-172) plus an OG2 Oct4-GFP reporter transgene (Yoshimizu 1999),but lack a TO cassette. A second control consisted of wild type (C57BL/6) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (CtrlMEF). Oct4-inducible mouse embryonic fibroblasts (TO-MEFs) and neural stem cell (TO-NSCs) were derived from 14.5 days post coitum (d.p.c.) embryos and cultured as previously described (Conti 2005, PLoS Biol 3:e283). Primary bone marrow cells (TO-BMCs) were isolated from 6-week old mice after flushing femora and tibiae and plated onto dishes with a combined coating of gelatin (PAA, Pasching, Austria), laminin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and poly-L-lysine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Adherent cells were then cultivated in DMEM Low Glucose (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100   g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM/L glutamine (all PAA). The transgenic Oct4 expression was induced by either 6   g/ml doxycycline (Sigma) or by 2   g/ml doxycycline (Dox) plus 10   7 M dexamethasone (Sigma), depending on the respectively contained tetracycline transactivator. 5-azacytidine (10 nM, Sigma) and cycloheximide (30   g/ml, Sigma) were applied as indicated. Generation, culture, and differentiation of ESCs and iPSCs were performed as previously described (Tiemann 2011, Cytometry A 79:426-435). Microarray Gene Expression Analysis Samples from Oct4-inducible cell types and controls were collected at different time points (0, 6, 12, and 24 hours after induction). Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared with the linear TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) from 500 ng original RNA and hybridized onto MouseRef 8 v2.0 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The chips were stained with streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and scanned using the iScan reader (Illumina). Bead intensities were mapped to gene information using BeadStudio 3.2 (Illumina) and background correction was performed using the Affymetrix robust multiarray analysis model. Variance stabilization was performed by log2 scaling and the R-Bioconductor lumi package was used for normalization. 17 samples were analyzed.ESC: Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC)TO_MEF_0: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF), time 0hTO_MEF-6: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF), time 6hTO_MEF-12: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF), time 12hTO_MEF-24: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF), time 24hTO_BMC-0: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Bone Marrow Cell (BMC), time 0hTO_BMC-6: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Bone Marrow Cell (BMC), time 6hTO_BMC-12: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Bone Marrow Cell (BMC), time 12hTO_BMC-24: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Bone Marrow Cell (BMC), time 24hTO_NSC-0: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Neural Stem Cell (NSC), time 0hTO_NSC-6: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Neural Stem Cell (NSC), time 6hTO_NSC-12: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Neural Stem Cell (NSC), time 12hTO_NSC-24: Tetracycline Oct4 (TO) Mouse Neural Stem Cell (NSC), time 24hCtrl_MEF_0: Control wild type Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) untreatedCtrl_MEF_24: Control wild type Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) 24h treatedCtrl_NSC_0: Control wild type Mouse Neural Stem Cell (NSC) untreatedCtrl_NSC_24: Control wild type Mouse Neural Stem Cell (NSC) 24h treated .. bone marrow cell;  mouse embryonic fibroblast;  mouse embryonic stem cell;  neural stem cell;  total RNA;  Ctrl_MEF_0;  Ctrl_MEF_14;  Ctrl_NSC_0;  Ctrl_NSC_24;  ESC;  TO_BMC_0;  TO_BMC_12;  TO_BMC_24;  TO_BMC_6;  TO_MEF_0;  TO_MEF_12;  TO_MEF_24;  TO_MEF_6;  TO_NSC_0;  TO_NSC_12;  TO_NSC_24;  TO_NSC_6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  0;  12;  24;  6;  No;  Yes;

However, the molecular mechanisms of obesity-induced fatty liver remain largely unknown.In order to identify genes that are potentially involved in dysfunctional hepatic lipid homeostasis in obesity, we performed a clustering analysis of Affymetrix arrays,which revealed that a number of mRNAs were dys-regulated in the livers of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), compared with mice fed a normal chow diet (ND). To identify genes that are potentially involved in dysfunctional hepatic lipid homeostasis in obesity, male C57BL/6 mice aged 8 weeks were fed a normal diet (ND) or high-fat-diet (HFD) containing 60 Kcal% of fat for 12 weeks. Then mice were sacrificed and total RNAs were isoloated from hepatic tissues.

We used the mouse autosomal translocation T(16;17)43H (abbreviated T43H) and t12 haplotype, a natural variant of Chr 17 encompassing four adjacent non-overlapping inversions proximal to the T43H translocation breakpoint, as a model. The presence of t12 haplotype in trans to the T43H translocation resulted in stringent spermatogenic block and in more complete silencing of genes surrounding the T43H translocation break. Strikingly, silencing of the unsynapsed autosomal chromatin preceded the inactivation of the sex chromosomes (MSCI) and was apparent already in the population of pre-mid pachytene spermatocytes and testes of 15 days old males. Populations of pre-mid-pachytene spermatocytes were isolated from Ttf+/+T43H and t12+/+T43 males in three biological replicates. Their expression was compared to two biological replicates of the populations of pre-mid pachytene spermatocytes and mid-late pachytene spermatocytes obtained from C57BL/10J fertile males.

However, whether active deubiquitination co-regulates ubH2A levels in ESCs and during differentiation is not known. Here, we report that the histone H2A deubiquitinase Usp16 regulates H2A deubiquitination and gene expression in ESCs, and importantly, is required for ESC differentiation. Usp16 knockout is embryonic lethal in mice, but does not affect ESC viability or identity. Usp16 binds to the promoter regions of a large number of genes in ESCs and Usp16 binding is inversely correlated with ubH2A levels and positively correlated with gene expression levels. Intriguingly, Usp16-/- ESCs fail to differentiate due to ubH2A-mediated repression of lineage-specific genes. Finally, Usp16, but not the enzymatically inactive mutant, rescues the differentiation defects of Usp16-/- ESCs. Therefore, this study identifies Usp16 and H2A deubiquitination as critical regulators of ESC gene expression and differentiation.

We demonstrate that Runx3 is non-redundantly involved in the proliferation of early pre-committed OBL progenitor cells, a critical step in the generation of adequate numbers of bone-forming OBLs. Thus, in the absence of Runx3 in cells of this lineage, the number of mature/active OBLs is significantly diminished, providing a mechanistic explanation to the observed osteopenia. This experiment was aimed at identifying genes that are likely regulated by Runx3 along osteoblastogenesis. To elucidate the Runx3-mediated transcriptional program along OBL differentiation, we compared gene expression profile in WT and Runx3f/f/Col1a1-cre calvarial OBLs.

In most cell types, deletion of both Hdac1 and Hdac2 is required to generate a discernible phenotype, suggesting their activity is largely redundant.  We have therefore generated an embryonic stem cell (ES) line in which Hdac1 and Hdac2 can be inactivated simultaneously using a Tamoxifen inducible CreER fusion.  Loss of HDAC1/2 results in a 60% reduction in total HDAC activity and a loss of cell viability.  Cell death is cell cycle dependent, since differentiated, non-proliferating cells, retain their viability. Furthermore, we observe increased mitotic defects, lagging chromosomes and micronuclei, suggesting HDAC1/2 maintain chromosomal stability.  Consistent with a critical role in the regulation of gene expression, microarray analysis of Hdac1/2 deleted cells reveals 1,708 differentially expressed genes.  Significantly for the maintenance of stem cell self-renewal, we detected a reduction in the expression of the pluripotent transcription factors, Oct4, Nanog and Rex1.  HDAC1/2 activity is regulated through binding of inositol tetraphosphate molecule [Ins(1,4,5,6)P4] (IP4) sandwiched between the HDAC and its cognate co-repressor.  This raises the important question of whether the IP4 actually regulates the activity of the complex in cells.  By rescuing the viability of DKO cells, we demonstrate for the first time that mutations which abolish IP4 binding reduce the activity of HDAC1/2 in vivo.  Our data indicate that HDAC1/2 have a generic, but essential role in cellular proliferation and regulate stem cell self-renewal by maintaining expression of key pluripotent transcription factors.

With biological duplicates, more than 200 million reads in total for each age of HSC were obtained.   Comparison of the young and old HSC transcriptomes revealed that 1,337 genes that were up-regulated, and 1,297 genes were down-regulated with HSC aging. The most highly represented upstream regulator was growth factor TGFB1, accounting for ~ 19% of differential gene expression in young versus old HSC (p-value = 1.96E-33). Gene ontology (GO) analyses indicated that up-regulated genes in 24mo HSCs are highly enriched in Regulation of Cell Adhesion, Regulation of Cell Proliferation and Ribosome, while down-regulated genes are enriched in DNA Base Excision Repair, DNA replication and Cell Cycle. RNA-seq also allowed us to examine alternative isoforms with aging including alternative splicing, promoter usage and pre-mRNA abundance.

We show that triplication of only 31 genes orthologous to the putative DS Critical Region (DSCR) on chr.21q22 is sufficient to promote B cell-autonomous self-renewal, in vivo  maturation defects and leukemogenesis in concert  with BCR-ABL.    DSCR triplication results in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) hypomethylation at gene promoters and a transcriptional signature characterized by de-repression of genes targeted by polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2), which methylates H3K27.    The same signature is highly enriched among human DS-associated ALLs.    Pharmacologic inhibition of PRC2 function is sufficient to confer self-renewal in wild-type B cells while inhibition of H3K27me3 demethylases completely blocks self-renewal induced by DSCR triplication.    Finally, overexpression of the DSCR factor HMGN1, a nucleosome remodeling protein that suppresses H3K27me3, is necessary for self-renewal in B cells with DSCR triplication.

Two mature mRNAs, Fosb and   Fosb, encoding full-length FOSB and   FOSB proteins respectively, are formed by alternative splicing of Fosb mRNA. Fosb products are expressed in several brain regions. Moreover, Fosb-null mice exhibit depressive-like behaviors and adult-onset spontaneous epilepsy, demonstrating important roles in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Study of Fosb products has focused almost exclusively on neurons; their function in glial cells remains to be explored. In this study, we found that microglia express equivalent levels of Fosb and   Fosb mRNAs to hippocampal neurons and, using microarray analysis, we identified six microglial genes whose expression is dependent on Fosb products. Of these genes, we focused on C5ar1 and C5ar2, which encode receptors for complement C5a. In isolated Fosb-null microglia, chemotactic responsiveness toward the truncated form of C5a was significantly lower than that in wild-type cells. Fosb-null mice were significantly resistant to kainate-induced seizures compared with wild-type mice. C5ar1 mRNA levels and C5aR1 immunoreactivity were increased in wild-type hippocampus 24 hours after kainate administration; however, such induction was significantly reduced in Fosb-null hippocampus. Furthermore, microglial activation after kainate administration was significantly diminished in Fosb-null hippocampus, as shown by significant reductions in CD68 immunoreactivity, morphological change and reduced levels of Il6 and Tnf mRNAs, although no change in the number of Iba-1-positive cells was observed. These findings demonstrate that, under excitotoxicity, Fosb products contribute to a neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus through regulation of microglial C5ar1 and C5ar2 expression. fosB+/G mice with a null-mutant allele, fosBG, were established and maintained by backcrossing to C57BL/6J.

We identified three ROR  t-specific inhibitors that suppress Th17 cell responses including Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune disease. We systemically characterized ROR  t binding data in the presence and absence of drug with corresponding whole-transcriptome sequencing for wild-type and ROR  t-deficient cells. ROR  t is central in a densely interconnected regulatory network, acting both as a direct activator of genes important for Th17 cell differentiation and as a direct repressor of genes from other T-cell lineages. The three inhibitors identified here reversed both of these modes of action, but to varying extents and through distinct mechanisms. Whereas one inhibitor displaced ROR  t from its target-loci, the two more potent inhibitors affected transcription predominantly without removing DNA-binding.

We performed deep RNA-sequencing for high-resolution analysis of transcriptome changes during postnatal mouse heart development using RNA from ventricles and freshly isolated cardiomyocytes (CM) and cardiac fibroblasts (CF). Extensive changes in gene expression and AS occur primarily between postnatal days 1 and 28. CM and CF showed reciprocal regulation of gene expression during postnatal development reflecting differences in proliferative capacity, cell adhesion functions, and mitochondrial metabolism. We found that AS plays a novel role in vesicular trafficking and membrane organization during postnatal CM development. Interestingly, these AS transitions are enriched among targets of two RNA-binding proteins, Celf1 and Mbnl1, which undergo developmentally regulated change in expression. Vesicular traffic genes affected by AS during normal development where Celf1 is down-regulated, showed a reversion to neonatal AS patterns when Celf1 was over-expressed in adults.

We previously observed that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from C57BL/6 mice exhibited increased killing activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei compared to BMM from BALB/c mice. This effect was particularly pronounced when cells were treated with IFN-  . To unravel mechanisms that could explain these distinct bactericidal effects, a comparative combined proteome and transcriptome analysis of untreated and IFN-   treated BALB/c and C57BL/6 BMM under standardized serum-free conditions was carried out. We found differences in gene expression/ protein abundance belonging to cellular oxidative and antioxidative stress systems. Genes/ proteins involved in the generation of oxidant molecules and the function of phagosomes (respiratory chain ATPase, lysosomal enzymes, cathepsin) were predominantly higher expressed/ more abundant in C57BL/6 BMM. Components involved in alleviation of oxidative stress (peroxiredoxin, mitochondrial superoxide dismutase) were more abundant in C57BL/6 BMM as well. Thus, C57BL/6 BMM seemed to be better equipped with cellular systems that may be advantageous in combating engulfed pathogens. Simultaneously, C57BL/6 BMM were well protected from oxidative burst. We assume that these variations co-determine differences in resistance between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice observed in many infection models.  Biological significance: In this study we performed combined transcriptome and proteome analyses on BMM derived from two inbred mouse strains that are frequently used for studies in the field of host-pathogen interaction research. Strain differences between BALB/c and C57BL/6 BMM were found to originate mainly from different protein abundance levels rather than from different gene expression. Differences in abundance of respiratory chain complexes and phagosomal proteins as well as differential regulation of components belonging to various antioxidant stress systems help to explain long-known differences between the mouse strains concerning their different susceptibility in several infection models.

While loss of individual Tet enzymes or combined deficiency of Tet1/2 allows for embryogenesis, the effect of complete loss of Tet activity and 5hmC marks in development is not established. We have generated Tet1/2/3 triple knockout (TKO) mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and examined their developmental potential. Combined deficiency of all three Tets depleted 5hmC and impaired ESC differentiation as seen in poorly differentiated TKO embryoid bodies (EBs) and teratomas. Consistent with impaired differentiation, TKO-ESCs contributed poorly to chimeric embryos and could not support embryonic development. Global gene expression and methylome analyses of TKO-EBs revealed promoter hypermethylation and deregulation of genes implicated in embryonic development and differentiation. These findings suggest a requirement for Tet- and 5hmC-mediated DNA demethylation in proper regulation of gene expression during differentiation of ESCs and development. To quantify global gene expression in differentiating embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from wild type (WT) and Tet triple knockout (TKO), TKO and WT mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were differentiated in vitro to EBs and cultured for 10 days. RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy kit and subjected to microarray analysis. Global gene expression profile of two technical replicas of WT embryoid bodies (2 samples in total) was compared to two technical replicas of two independent TKO embryoid bodies (4 TKO samples in total). .. embryoid bodies;  Tet1/2/3 triple knockout;  WT;  total RNA;  Embryoid bodies, Tet TKO;  Embryoid bodies, WT;  mixed 129/C57BL6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Not applicable.;

It occurs in the setting of potent calcineurin and mTOR inhibitor therapies, implying that T cells mediating chronic rejection can function with compromised calcineurin-NFAT or IL-2 receptor signaling pathways.  In murine models the T cells mediating allograft rejection in the setting of calcineurin inhibitor therapy are CD8 T cells making IFN-gamma without a requirement for perforin.  It is not known whether these pathologic T cells are a unique subset or how they function.  In parallel other animal model research has shown that alloepthelial cells residing in the donor organ are critical targets for rejection.  While investigating T cell-alloepithelial cell interactions, we discovered an unusual alloreactive CD8 T cell population that recognized MHC class II I-Abm12.  A CD8 T cell clone derived from that population was intrinsically-resistant to cyclosporine and rapamycin without prior exposure to either in vivo or in vitro.  Microarray analysis comparing the novel CD8 T cell clone to a conventional CD8 CTL clone specific for MHC class I Kbm1 suggested that the TCR signaling pathway responsible for cyclosporine-resistance utilized the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR).

Here we show that breast tumours appear earlier when mutant huntingtin is expressed in an activated polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyVT) mouse breast cancer model as compared to the control mice expressing wild-type huntingtin. Tumours bearing mutant huntingtin have a modified gene expression pattern revealing increases in the IGF-1/Akt signalling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastatic properties. Indeed, polyQ-huntingtin expressing tumours show hyper-activation of Akt pathway. Also, when mutant huntingtin is expressed, cancer cells in culture change morphology and the levels of cell adhesion and mesenchymal markers are affected in primary tumour or corresponding derived cells. As a consequence, PyVT induced lung metastasis is higher in Huntington disease mice than in the control mice. Finally, analysis of cases of Huntington disease patients developing breast cancer may suggest an increased aggressiveness of breast cancer when compared to the control population. 8 Total samples were analyzed: 4 x MMTV-PyVT/HdhQ7/Q7 breast tumours; 4 x MMTV-PyVT/HdhQ111/Q111 breast tumours; .. 111;  7;  total RNA;  MMTV-PyVT/HdhQ111/Q111 breast tumour;  MMTV-PyVT/HdhQ7/Q7 breast tumour;  FVB/CD1;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Tumors were not treated - genetic modifications;

Yet, comparatively little is known about effectiveness in the face of severe   -cell depletion. Moreover, direct and sequential effects of exendin-4 on islet-specific gene expression over time in vivo are not well characterised. To address these issues and others, we have examined the time-dependent effects of exendin-4 treatment on   -cell mass regulation alongside accompanying changes in islet gene expression in vivo. Context-dependent actions were assessed by comparing effects on normal islets and also following massive toxigenetic   -cell ablation in pIns-MYCERTAM transgenic mice in vivo. Despite over 90% loss of   -cell mass, exendin-4 treatment normalised blood glucose and insulin levels in hyperglycaemic mice, though benefits rapidly waned on withdrawal of treatment. As exendin-4 did not arrest the decline in   -cell mass or turnover in this study, we could directly isolate effects on function of surviving   -cells. Improved glucose homeostasis was associated with dynamic changes in multiple islet genes and pathways in vivo favouring glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, such as Irs2, Pdx1, Sox4, glucokinase, and glycolysis pathway. Several key growth pathways and epigenetic regulators were also differentially expressed. Thus, even in the face of extensive   -cell loss exendin-4 can markedly improve hyperglycaemia by differential gene expression in surviving islet cells. Activation of MYCERTAM was achieved through administration of 1mg of 4 hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by daily intraperitoneal injection. To assess the effect of exendin-4 on MYCER-induced hyperglycaemia, mice were given either twice-daily subcutaneous (sc) injections of exendin-4 (50ug/kg dissolved in 5mls water), or equivalent volumes of water vehicle, starting 2 days prior to 4OHT injections. For microarray analyses parallel mouse experiments were set up using 8-12 week old pIns-MYCERTAM male mice either treated with 4OHT or vehicle (peanut oil) and exendin-4 or vehicle, as described, for 4, 8, 16, 32 and 72 hours (n=3 for each time point and for each of four conditions; 4OHT and exendin-4 treated, peanut oil and exendin-4 treated, 4OHT and water treated, peanut oil and water treated).!Sample_data_processing = After the quality control step, the following 8 samples out of 60 showing poor reproducibility were excluded from our further study: GSM930242, GSM930247, GSM930251, GSM930263, GSM930264, GSM930289, GSM930291, GSM930298. .. 8-12 weeks;  male;  pIns-MYCERTAM transgenic;  total RNA;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_16 hrs;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_32 hrs;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_4 hrs;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_72 hrs;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_8 hrs;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_16 hrs;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_32 hrs;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_4 hrs;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_72 hrs;  c-Myc-activated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_8 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_16 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_32 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_4 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_72 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_exenatide_8 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_16 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_32 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_4 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_72 hrs;  c-Myc-unactivated_pancreatic islets_vehicle (water)_8 hrs;  CBA-C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  pancreatic islets;  exendin-4 (50ug/kg dissolved in 5mls water);  water (vehicle for exendin-4);  All mice were housed and treated in accordance with protocols and regulations sanctioned by the Home Office under the Animals Act of 1986.

To assess the perturbations of gene expression in T21, and to eliminate the noise of the genomic variability, we studied the transcriptome of fetal fibroblasts from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21. Here we show that the differential expression between the twins is organized in domains along all chromosomes that are either up- or downregulated. These gene expression dysregulation domains (GEDDs) can be defined by the expression level of their gene content, and are well conserved in induced pluripotent stem cells derived from the twins    fibroblasts. Comparison of the transcriptome of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS and wild-type, also showed GEDDs along the mouse chromosomes that were syntenic in human. The GEDDs correlate with the lamina-associated (LADs) and replication domains of mammalian cells. The overall LADs position was not altered in trisomic cells. However, the H3K4me3 profile of the trisomic fibroblasts was modified and accurately followed the GEDD pattern. These results suggest that the nuclear compartments of trisomic cells undergo modifications of the chromatin environment influencing the overall transcriptome and that GEDDs may therefore contribute to some T21 phenotypes. mRNA-Seq profiling in Down syndrome: fibroblasts derived from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21 (4 replicates), iPS cells from the same pair of discordant twins, fibroblasts from a pair of normal monozygotic twins, fibroblasts from 16 unrelated individuals (8 trisomic and 8 euploid controls), fibroblasts from the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome (1 trisomic mouse and 1 control wt). ..

Our recent research has revealed that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment causes a long-lasting change in the phenotypes of mature dentate granule neurons to immature state in adult mouse DG. However, it is unknown whether this    dematuration    of DG is a common effect of antidepressant treatments and what mechanisms underlie it. Using electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), a model of highly effective and fast-acting antidepressant therapy, here we show that neural stimulation via ECS induces rapid and lasting dematuration of granule neurons in DG. A single or few times of stimulation transiently reduced mature marker expression and mature synaptic functions. Repetitive stimulation converted this transient dematuration into a stable form lasting more than 1 month. Dematured granule neurons showed higher excitability, and an increase in GABA-mediated inhibition by the benzodiazepine diazepam prevented the lasting maintenance phase of dematuration without affecting the initial induction phase. Our study suggests that dematuration of DG is a common cellular mechanism underlying effects of different types of antidepressant treatments, and demonstrate a novel role for excitation/inhibition balance in bidirectional regulation of the state of neuronal maturation in the adult brain. Mice were decapitated after the 11 times of ECS (or Sham) or 4 weeks treatment of fluoxetine (or vehicle) at a dose of 22 mg/kg. The brains were sliced and the frequency facilitation of mossy fiber synapse was measured in each sample. The samples which exhibited low frequency facilitation were selected to be used as dematured DG (n = 3) and the dentate gyrus was dissected from each sample. Total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) and the samples of the same groups were put together. From each group, 100 ng of total RNA was amplified with 3   IVT Express kit (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). All samples were hybridized to the GeneChip mouse genome 430A 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Inc.), and the microarray suite 5.0 of the Affymetrix gene chip operating software was used for the analysis of the GeneChip data. .. total RNA;  mouse dentate gyrus of hippocampus, ECS, 11 times, 6 h;  mouse dentate gyrus of hippocampus, fluoxetine (22mg/kg), 28days;  mouse dentate gyrus of hippocampus, sham, 11 times, 6 h;  mouse dentate gyrus of hippocampus, water, 28days;  C57Bl/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  dentate gyrus of hippocampus;  Bilateral ECS (current, 25 mA; shock duration, 1 sec; frequency, 100 pulse/sec; pulse width, 0.5 msec) was administered via moistened, spring-loaded ear-clip electrodes with a pulse generator (ECT Unit; Ugo Basile, Comeria, Italy) to mice that were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5 to 2%) in order to avoid sudden unexpected death associated with seizures.ECS was administered 4 times a week for 3 weeks. The Sham-treated animals were handled in an identical manner to the ECS-treated animals, without the administration of shock. For chronic SSRI administration, fluoxetine hydrochloride was dissolved in drinking water and orally applied at a dose of 22 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. The fluoxetine solutions were prepared everyday, and daily fluoxetine intake was determined for individual mice on the basis of the water consumption during the preceding 24 h and the body weight measured every other day. Saccharin (0.2%) was included in the fluoxetine solution to keep water intake comparable to the baseline.;

Here, we used syngeneic immunocompetent mice that allowed precise evaluation of the immunogenicity of the side population (SP) isolated from 4T1 murine breast carcinoma (4T1-SP) cells as putative CSCs. 4T1-SP cells showed various stem cell properties including high capacities for colony formation and tumorigenicity as well as high expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and vascular endothelial growth factor that are inductive of immune tolerance. Despite these progressive malignant characteristics of 4T1-SP cells, subcutaneous injection of non-transmissible Sendai virus-mediated GM-CSF gene-transduced 4T1-SP (4T1-SP/GM) cells remarkably impaired their tumorigenicity compared with that of the controls. This impairment of tumorigenicity was partially dependent on CD8+ T cells in concert with CD4+ T cells and natural killer cells. Notably, therapeutic vaccinations using irradiated 4T1-SP/GM cells markedly suppressed tumor development of subcutaneously transplanted 4T1-SP cells compared with that of the controls including irradiated 4T1-non-SP/GM cells. Tumor suppression was accompanied by robust accumulation of mature dendritic cells at vaccination sites and systemic Th1-based cellular immunity. Moreover, vaccinations comprising primary 4T1-SP cells isolated from transplanted 4T1-SP tumors elicited antitumor effects. cDNA microarray analysis showed that 4T1-SP cells predominantly expressed genes of cancer-related antigens including cancer/testis antigens. Collectively, we demonstrate that SP cell-based vaccinations induce effective antitumor immunity that may improve the efficacy of SP cell-based immunotherapy.

In that context, we recently reported the direct reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). In this study, we, for the first time, successfully reprogrammed these iNSCs into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which we termed iNSC-derived iPSCs (iNdiPSCs). iNdiPSCs proved to be truly pluripotent, as shown by a pluripotent gene expression profile and the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers both, in vitro and in vivo. We could further show that iNdiPSCs do not retain an epigenetic memory neither from iNSCs nor MEFs. In conclusion, our data validate the stable somatic stem cell status of iNSCs and demonstrate their potential to give rise to bona fide iPSCs that are indistinguishable from other iPSCs or embryonic stem cells. Cell culture conditions: iNdiPSCs were grown on feeder cells in 2i medium (Knockout DMEM supplemented with 20% Knockout serum replacement, 0.2x -Mercaptoethanol (all GIBCO), 1x nonessential amino acids and 1x penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (PSG) (both PAA), 1nM PD0325901, 3nM CHIR99021 (both Axon Medchem), and 1000 U/ml leukemia inhibitory factor [in house preparation]).

Cells were harvested and resuspended by slowly adding 4 ml 0.56% prewarmed KCl, incubated for 15 min at 37C and spun down at 900 rpm for 5 min. Fresh fixative (3 parts methanol plus 1 part acetic acid) was very slowly added to the pellet to a final volume of 3 ml and incubated for 30 min at RT. Cells were subsequently washed 3 times in fixative and resuspened in fixative. Approximately 20 microl were dropped from a height of about 2 m on a dry slide. Drops were air dried for 30 min and mounted with DAPI containing mounting solution. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real time PCR (qRTPCR) RNA was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeas Mini Kit (cat no. 74106) and cDNA synthesis performed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). qRTPCR was carried out using iTaq SYBR Green Supermix With ROX (Bio-Rad). Oct4 promoter methylation analysis: Bisulfite conversion was performed using the QIAGEN EpiTect    Bisulfite Kit (Cat no. 59104). Followed by nested PCR using a set of target region specific primers. The first PCR was performed using 1micro-l of bisulfite converted and purified DNA, SuperTaq polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturers protocol and a total of 35 cycles with denaturation at 94C for 30 s, followed by 30 s of annealing at 50C and 72C elongation for 1 min with an initial denaturation at 94C and a final elongation step at 72C for 3 min each. For the second PCR, we used Taq polymerase according to the manufacturers protocol (New England Biolabs) and 1 microl of the first PCR product with denaturation at 95C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95C, annealing for 30 s at 55C and elongation for 1 min at 68C, and finally an additional elongation step for 5 min at 68C. The amplified fragments were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel, purified using the QIAGEN QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Cat no. 28706) and subsequently cloned into the pCRII-TOPO-vector using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). The cloned products were transformed into One Shot TOP10 competent bacteria (Invitrogen) and plated on agar plates. The picked colonies were sent to GATC for sequencing. The results were then analyzed with the QUMA software (online available at www.quma.cdb.riken.jp). Immunocytochemistry: Cells were fixed for 5 min in 4% PFA at RT, washed twice in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and washed again twice in PBS. Followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (GIBCO) for 1 h shaking at RT. Subsequently the first antibody was added in 1% BSA and incubated for 1 h shaking at RT.

DNA extraction and PCR: DNA extraction was performed using the QIAGEN QIAamp    DNA Mini Kit (cat no. 51306). PCR was carried out using Taq polymerase including buffers from New England Biolabs, following their recommended protocol. The following primers were used for genotyping: pMX-Oct4, -Klf4, -Sox2, -c-Myc and -Brn4. In vitro differentiation: First, hanging drops were formed placing 20   l drops containing 600 cells each on the lid of a 10cm cell culture dish, which was then inverted. After 3 days, hanging drops were transferred to gelatin-coated dishes and cultured in standard MEF medium (DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum (both GIBCO) and 1x PSG), which was also used for hanging drop formation. After approximately 10-14 days the cells were fixed and stained as described above. Teratoma formation: 1 x 106 iNdiPSCs were injected subcutaneously into SCID mice. Tumors were resected after 4 weeks and fixed in 4% PFA. Paraffin sections were cut, mounted on glass slides and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Animal handling was performed in accordance with the German animal protection law and the guidelines of the Max Planck Institute. Microarray analysis: Purified cRNA samples were prepared with the linear TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) from 500 ng original RNA, involving synthesis of double-stranded cDNA by T7-promoter-linked oligo(dT) primers and 14 h of in vitro transcription incorporating biotin-labeled nucleotides. Hybridization onto MouseRef 8 v2.0 Expression BeadChips (Illumina) was performed according to the manufacturer   s recommendations. Chips were stained with streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare) and scanned using an iScan reader (Illumina). The bead intensities were mapped to gene information using BeadStudio 3.2 (Illumina). Background correction was performed using the Affymetrix robust multiarray analysis (RMA) background correction model.

In this study, we described a previously unrecognized function for Wnt-Lrp5 signaling in the osteoblast that allows bone to acquire the resources necessary to fuel bone formation.  Mice lacking the Lrp5 co-receptor specifically in osteoblasts and osteocytes exhibit the expected reductions in postnatal bone mass and also develop peripheral adiposity with corresponding reductions in energy expenditure.  Conversely, mice expressing a high-bone mass mutant Lrp5 allele are leaner with reduced plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels.  In this context, Wnt-initiated signals downstream of Lrp5, but not Lrp6, regulate the expression of key enzymes required for fatty acid   -oxidation.  These results suggest that Wnt-Lrp5 signaling regulates basic cellular activities beyond those associated with fate-specification and differentiation in bone and that the skeleton influences global energy homeostasis via mechanisms independent of osteocalcin and glucose metabolism Total RNA isolated from cultures of Lrp5-deficient osteoblasts differentiated for 7 days in vitro compared to control osteoblasts .. primary calvarial osteoblasts;  Lrp5+/+;  Lrp5-/-;  total RNA;  Osteoblasts_Lrp5_Control_Day7;  Osteoblasts_Lrp5_Knockout_Day7;  C57Bl/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  day 7 of differentiation;  Osteoblasts were infected with adenovirus expressing Cre-recombinase or Green fluorescent protein 48 hours prior to inducing osteoblast differentiation.;

We here find that GlcN extends C. elegans lifespan by impairing glucose metabolism to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK/AAK2) leading to increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Consistent with the concept of mitohormesis, this promotes increased formation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and p38/PMK-1-mediated stress signaling culminating in increased expression of the nematodal amino acid-transporter 1 (aat-1) gene. Ameliorating mitochondrial ROS formation as well as impairment of aat-1-expression abolishes GlcN-mediated lifespan extension in a NRF2/SKN-1-dependent fashion. Notably and unlike other calorie restriction mimetics (CRM) like 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG, DOG), GlcN extends lifespan of aging C57BL/6 mice (log-rank: p=0.002; cox regression: p=0.01) similarly paralleled by an induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, increased expression of several murine amino acid transporters, as well as increased amino-acid catabolism.

The mutant enzymes exhibit neomorphic activity resulting in production of D2- hydroxyglutaric acid (D-2HG). To study the pathophysiological consequences of the  accumulation of D2-HG, we generated transgenic mice with conditionally activated IDH2R140Q and IDH2R172K alleles. Global induction of mutant IDH2 expression in adults  resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy, white matter abnormalities throughout the central nervous system (CNS), and muscular dystrophy. Embryonic activation of mutant IDH2  resulted in more pronounced phenotypes, including runting, hydrocephalus, and shortened life span   recapitulating the abnormalities observed in D2HGA patients. The  diseased hearts exhibited mitochondrial damage and glycogen accumulation with a concordant upregulation of genes involved in glycogen biosynthesis. Notably, mild  cardiac hypertrophy was also observed in nude mice implanted with IDH2R140Q expressing xenografts, suggesting that 2HG may potentially act in a paracrine fashion.  Finally, we show that silencing of IDH2R140Q in mice with an inducible transgene restores heart function by lowering 2HG levels. Together, these findings indicate that inhibitors of  mutant IDH2 may be beneficial in the treatment of D2HGA and suggest that 2HG produced by IDH mutant tumors has the potential to provoke a paraneoplastic condition. We have performed microarray expression profiling of hearts from IDH2 mutant and control mice. .. total RNA;  Control mice;  IDH2 R140Q mutant mice;  IDH2 R172K mutant mice;  mixed background of C57BL/6, 129/sv, and Balb/c;  10090;  Mus musculus;  heart;  Mutant mice were given 2mg 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) at 5 weeks of age for 3 days;

Methods: 12-week-old wild-type (WT) mice were used in this study. The experiment group underwent an optic nerve crush (ONC) procedure to induce axonal injury in the right eye, and the control group underwent a sham procedure. Retinal mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using IlluminaHiseq2000. The sequence reads were analyzed by CLC genomics workbench and R software. qRT   PCR validation was performed using TaqMan assays. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 66 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9). Differential gene expression analysis showed that endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes and antioxidative response-related genes have been shown to be significantly upregulated 2 days after ONC. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of retinal transcriptomes in the early stages after axonal injury. Our results indicated that ER stress plays a key role under these conditions. Furthermore, the antioxidative defense and immune responses occurred concurrently in the early stages after axonal injury. We believe that our study will lead to a better understanding of and insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying RGC death after axonal injury.

However, the entire repertoire of lncRNAs and the extent to which they regulate biological processes in different tissues and species are not defined. Indeed, most lncRNAs are not conserved between species, raising questions about function. We used RNA-Seq to identify lncRNAs in primary murine fetal liver erythroblasts expressing the lineage marker TER119, megakaryocytes (CD41+) cultured from embryonic day (E) 14.5 murine fetal liver and megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors (MEPs) isolated from mouse bone marrow. We identified 683 and 594 polyadenylated lncRNAs expressed in red blood cell (erythroid) precursors of mice and humans, respectively. More than one half of erythroid lncRNAs are un-annotated, emphasizing the opportunity for new discovery through studies of specialized cell types. We analyzed the expression of these identified lncRNAs in several hematopoietic compartments using a custom microarray to identify erythroid-specific lncRNAs that were robustly expressed in both fetal liver and adult erythroid cells as targets for knockdown. Over 90% of fetal liver erythroid lncRNAs detected using RNA-seq were expressed in adult erythroblasts measured on the microarray. Analysis of the murine erythroid lncRNA transcriptome indicates that ~75% arise from promoters and 25% from enhancers, many of which are regulated by the key erythroid transcription factors GATA1 and SCL/TAL1. Erythroid lncRNA expression is largely conserved among 8 different mouse strains, yet only 15% of mouse lncRNAs are expressed in humans and vice versa, reflecting dramatically greater species-specificity than coding genes. We investigated potential functions of 21 relatively abundant erythroid-specific murine lncRNAs (both conserved and non-conserved) by RNA interference in primary mouse erythroid precursors, and identified 7 whose knockdown inhibited features of terminal erythroid maturation including cell size reduction and enucleation. Strikingly, at least 6 of the 7 lncRNAs have no detectable expression in human erythroblasts, demonstrating that lack of conservation between mammalian species does not predict lack of function. These results reflect marked evolutionary differences between protein-coding genes and lncRNAs and indicate that the latter exert tissue- and species-specific roles in development.

Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is often induced with infection and plays a key role in the stress granulopoiesis response.  However, its effects on HSCs are less clear.  Herein, we show that treatment with G-CSF induces expansion and increased quiescence of phenotypic HSCs, but causes a marked, cell-autonomous HSC repopulating defect associated with induction of toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and signaling.  The G-CSF-mediated expansion of HSCs is reduced in mice lacking TLR2, TLR4 or the TLR signaling adaptor MyD88.  Induction of HSC quiescence is abrogated in mice lacking MyD88 or in mice treated with antibiotics to suppress intestinal flora. Finally, loss of TLR4 or germ free conditions mitigates the G-CSF-mediated HSC repopulating defect.  These data suggest that low level TLR agonist production by commensal flora contributes to the regulation of HSC function and that G-CSF negatively regulates HSCs, in part, by enhancing TLR signaling.

However, all such studies to date have been restricted by their reliance on microarray technologies which have intrinsic limitations. Here, we used advanced sequencing methods, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, to obtain an unprecedented view of cocaine-induced changes in gene expression and associated adaptations in numerous modes of chromatin regulation in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region. We identify unique combinations of chromatin changes, or signatures, that accompany cocaine   s regulation of gene expression, including the dramatic involvement of pre-mRNA alternative splicing in cocaine action. Together, this delineation of the cocaine-induced epigenome in the nucleus accumbens reveals several novel modes of drug regulation, thereby providing new insight into the biological basis of cocaine addiction. More broadly, the combinatorial chromatin and transcriptional approaches that we describe serve as an important resource for the field, as they can be applied to other systems to reveal novel transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of neuronal regulation. Total RNA was isolated from mouse nucleus accumbens 24 hr after 7 day daily cocaine or saline control ip injection for mRNA sequencing by following illumina RNA seq kit protocol. Another batch of acute cocaine RNA-seq was performed using the same parameters except the treatment group was given 6 days of saline injection followed by 1 day of cocaine injection.

Runx2, the master regulator of osteoblastogenesis, directs a transcription program essential for bone formation through both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. While individual Runx2 gene targets have been identified, further insights into the broad spectrum of Runx2 functions required for osteogenesis are needed. By performing genome-wide characterization of Runx2 binding at the three major stages of osteoblast differentiation: proliferation, matrix deposition and mineralization, we identified Runx2-dependent regulatory networks driving bone formation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) over the course of these stages, we discovered close to 80,000 significantly enriched regions of Runx2 binding throughout the mouse genome. These binding events exhibited distinct patterns during osteogenesis, and were associated with proximal promoters as well as a large percentage of Runx2 occupancy in non-promoter regions: upstream, introns, exons, transcription termination site (TTS) regions, and intergenic regions. These peaks were partitioned into clusters that are associated with genes in complex biological processes that support bone formation. Using Affymetrix expression profiling of differentiating osteoblasts depleted of Runx2, we identified novel Runx2 targets including Ezh2, a critical epigenetic regulator; Crabp2, a retinoic acid signaling component; Adamts4 and Tnfrsf19, two remodelers of extracellular matrix. We demonstrated by luciferase assays that these novel biological targets are regulated by Runx2 occupancy at non-promoter regions. Our data establish that Runx2 interactions with chromatin across the genome reveal novel genes, pathways and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of osteoblastogenesis. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with scramble or Runx2 shRNA, then harvested at proliferating stage (day 0) and differentiating stage (day 9). Total RNAs recovered from these cells were hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to find new target genes or pathways regulated by Runx2 during osteoblast differentiation. When combined with genome-wide occupancy of Runx2, we expect to gain new insights on how Runx2 controls a transcriptional program essential for osteoblast differentiation. .. total RNA;  differentiating MC3T3-E1 cells treated with Runx2-specific shRNA;  differentiating MC3T3-E1 cells treated with control scramble shRNA;  proliferating MC3T3-E1 cells treated with control scramble shRNA;  10090;  Mus musculus;  calvaria;  Lentiviruses carrying Runx2-shRNA and control Scramble-shRNA was used to infect MC3T3-E1 cells respectively.

To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of transgenic mice that expressed HB-EGF throughout the intestine, but develop serrated polyps only in the cecum. Here we show that a host-specific microbiome was associated with serrated polyps, and that alterations of the microbiota induced by antibiotic treatment or by embryo-transfer rederivation markedly inhibited the formation of serrated polyps in the cecum. Mechanistically, development of serrated polyps was associated with a local decrease in epithelial barrier-function, bacterial invasion, production of antimicrobials, and increased expression of several inflammatory factors such as IL-17, Cxcl2, Tnf-  , and IL-1. Increased number of neutrophils were found within the serrated polyps, and their depletion significantly reduced polyp growth. Together these results indicate that non-genetic factors contribute to the development of serrated polyps and suggest that the development of these intestinal neoplasms in the cecum is driven by the interplay between genetic changes in the host, an inflammatory response, and a host-specific microbiota. We obtained serrated polyp (SP) and surrounding normal (NM) tissue from the ceca of three affected mice (paired design) and assessed expression differences by RNA-Seq. .. total RNA;  Normal surrounding (distal) cecum tissue from HBUS mouse 1119;  Normal surrounding (distal) cecum tissue from HBUS mouse 1192;  Normal surrounding (distal) cecum tissue from HBUS mouse 1199;  Serrated polyp tissue from HBUS mouse 1119;  Serrated polyp tissue from HBUS mouse 1192;  Serrated polyp tissue from HBUS mouse 1199;  HBUS;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Normal surrounding (distal) cecum;  Serrated polyp;

The concept that antioxidants can help fight cancer is deeply rooted in the general population, promoted by the food supplement industry, and supported by some scientific studies. However, clinical trials have reported inconsistent results. Here, we show that supplementing the diet with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin E markedly increases tumor progression and reduces survival in mouse models of B-RAF- and K-RAS-induced lung cancer. RNA sequencing revealed that NAC and vitamin E, which are structurally unrelated, produce highly coordinated changes in tumor transcriptome profiles, dominated by reduced expression of endogenous antioxidant genes. NAC and vitamin E increase tumor cell proliferation by reducing ROS, DNA damage, and p53 expression in mouse and human lung tumor cells. Inactivation of p53 increases tumor growth to a similar degree as antioxidants and abolishes the antioxidant effect. Thus, antioxidants accelerate tumor growth by inactivating the ROS-p53 axis. Because p53 inactivation occurs late in tumor progression, antioxidants may accelerate the growth of early tumors or precancerous lesions in high-risk populations such as smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who receive NAC to relieve mucus production. There were 3 experimental groups (untreated, NAC-treated and Vitamin E-treated. Each group consisted of 5 animals, and from each animal we harvested 2 tumor samples.

The mechanisms that maintain these progenitor-like characteristics are poorly understood. We report that the transcription factor Zfx is required for the development and propagation of experimental AML caused by MLL-AF9 fusion, and of T-ALL caused by Notch1 activation. In both leukemia types, Zfx activated progenitor-associated gene expression programs and prevented differentiation. Key Zfx target genes included mitochondrial enzymes Ptpmt1 and Idh2, whose overexpression partially rescued the propagation of Zfx-deficient AML. These studies identify a common mechanism that controls the cell-of-origin characteristics of acute leukemias derived from disparate lineages and transformation mechanisms.

To date, multiple mutations have been identified in patients with various types of hypospadias. In this regard, the mouse homologous gene Mamld1 is transiently expressed in fetal Sertoli and Leydig cells around the critical period for sex development, and transient Mamld1 knockdown using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) reduces testosterone production in cultured mouse Leydig tumor cells (MLTCs). We performed detailed analyses in Mamld1 knockdown experiments using MLTCs.   We used microarrays to display the global gene expression profile change, after knockdown of Mamld1 expression in MLTCs, to find the gene set regulated by Mamld1. To compare changes in gene expression profile in MLTCs, MLTCs were transfected with control siRNA or Mamld1 siRNA, 48h later, total RNA was subjected to Q-PCR to confirm a significantly decreased Mamld1 mRNA, and then these total RNA samples were for microarray analysis. The microarray data was analyzed to explore gene sets/pathways, which were significantly impacted by knockdown of Mamld1.  Real-time RT-PCR and microarray analyses showed significantly decreased Cyp17a1 expression (~70%) in both siRNA1- and siRNA2-transfected MLTCs. The siRNAs knockdown did not affect the expressions of Nr5a1 (Sf1), Star, Por, and Insl3.   47 genes including a Notch-related gene Hey1 were significantly up-regulated (fold change >2.0) and 38 genes were significantly down-regulated (fold change <0.5) in both siRNA1- and siRNA2-transfected MLTCs (Table S1 and Table S2). However, Mamld1 knockdown had no discernible effect on the Hes3 expression level (siRNA1: fold change 0.92, P=0.80; siRNA2: fold change 1.43, P=0.35). MLTCs were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and were transiently transfected with two siRNAs against Mamld1 or with non-targeting control RNA.

Thus, there is a critical need to identify early biomarkers for detection of the developing HCC, as well as molecular pathways that would be amenable to therapeutic intervention.  While efforts using human serum and tissues from late stage patients have been undertaken, progress has been limited. We have therefore explored the possibility of utilizing established mouse models for the discovery of biomarkers, as well as to understand in a systematic manner the molecular pathways that are progressively deregulated by the various etiological factors in contributing to HCC formation.  As an initial effort, we have used the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) transgenic mice as a hepatitis model, which have been exposed to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1).  In this report, we present the initial findings from a extensive longitudinal study, which confirms the synergistic effect of both these etiological factors, with a gender bias towards male mice.  Tumors from the mouse models were validated both histologically as well as by molecular transcriptome analysis by comparison with human HCCs.  In addition, using these models, we have identified carnitine as a novel biomarker for HCC development, which was again validated using human HCC samples. Conclusion: This study therefore highlights the utility of these mouse models in identifying biomarkers for detection of human HCCs, as well as for the systematic analysis of molecular pathways that are affected by various etiological agents during the progression of HCC from an untransformed hepatocyte, which could provide novel options for targeted therapy. liver obtained from Mus musculus which was intraperitoneally injected with AFB/oil at Day 7 and sacrificed at 15 month age.

This work investigates the influence of small molecules that have been previously reported to improve differentiation to cardiomyocytes as well as reprogramming to iPSCs in conjunction with ectopic expression of the transcription factors Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2C, and Tbx5 on the conversion to functional iCMs.  We utilized a reporter system in which the calcium indicator GCaMP is driven by the cardiac Troponin T promoter to quantify iCM yield.  The TGF   inhibitor, SB431542 (SB), was identified as a small molecule capable of increasing the conversion of both mouse embryonic fibroblasts and adult cardiac fibroblasts to iCMs up to ~5 fold.  Further characterization revealed that inhibition of TGF   by SB early in the reprogramming process led to the greatest increase in conversion of fibroblasts to iCMs in a dose-responsive manner.  Global transcriptional analysis at Day 3 post-induction of the transcription factors revealed an increased expression of genes associated with the development of cardiac muscle in the presence of SB compared to the vehicle control.  Incorporation of SB in the reprogramming process increases the efficiency of iCM generation, one of the major goals necessary to enable the use of iCMs for discovery-based applications and for the clinic. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were transfected with an empty vector (0F) or the combination of  Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2C, and Tbx5 (5F).

Analysis of mechanosenstive microRNA in the mouse carotid endothelium.  In this study, we examined the microRNAs that respond differentially to blood flow pattern in the mouse carotid endothelium.  We surgically induced disturbed blood flow in the left common carotid cartery (LCA) using partial carotid ligation surgery while the right carotid artery was left undisturbed.  The hypothesis tested here is that turbulent or disturbed blood flow across the left carotid artery endothelium will affect endothelial genes and microRNAS.  Identifying flow-sensitive microRNAs will provide important information about how endothelium responds to d-flow and regulates endothelial function and progression of atherosclerosis. Deter-  mining the functional importance of these novel mechanosensitive microRNAS may provide important insights into understanding vascular biology and atherosclerosis.

We used microarray analysis to identify cellular genes that are differentially regulated following infection of the brain with JEV (P3) or WNV (New York 99). Gene expression data for these flaviviruses was compared to that induced following infection of the brain with reovirus (Type 3 Dearing), an unrelated neurotropic virus. Although several studies have described gene expression changes following virus infection of the brain, this report is the first to directly compare large-scale gene expression data from different viruses. We found that a large number of genes were up-regulated in common to infections with all 3 viruses (fold change > 2, P < 0.001), including genes associated with interferon signaling, the immune system, inflammation and cell death/survival signaling. In addition, genes associated with glutamate signaling were down-regulated in common to infections with all 3 viruses (fold change > 2, P < 0.001). These genes may serve broad spectrum therapeutic targets for virus-induced CNS disease.

Although evidence of a crosstalk between H3K9 and H3K27 methylations has started to emerge, their actual interplay remains elusive. Here, we show that PRC2 and G9a/GLP interact physically and functionally. Moreover, combining different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that Ezh2 and G9a/GLP share an important number of common genomic targets, encoding developmental and neuronal regulators. Furthermore, we show that G9a enzymatic activity modulates PRC2 genomic recruitment to a subset of its target genes.

For instances, the presence of short bidirectional transcripts is a hallmark of active promoters in mammals, while upstream non-coding transcripts can be detected at most expressed genes in conditions where the RNA degradation machinery is inhibited. Here, we used RNA-seq with very high sequencing depth to characterize strand specific transcripts from primary mouse tissues. We found that a substantial fraction of gene promoters sustain expression of long non-coding antisense transcripts. These transcripts have an average size of 6 kb, have features of mature transcripts, but remain associated with the chromatin. We named this new class of non-coding RNAs Long Upstream Antisense Transcripts (LUAT). Strikingly, the LUAT and coding gene pairs are usually co-regulated, with the associated genes often/generally coding for transcriptional regulators functioning during development and cell differentiation. Indeed, these bidirectional promoters share several characteristic of developmental gene promoters, including large CpG islands and high degree of conservation, and display symetrical GC skews. Finally, we found that bidirectional promoters have enlarged platforms of Pol II initiation, associated with an intensified rate of early transcriptional elongation. We concluded that promoters of developmental regulators are characterized by a specialized mechanism of Pol II transcription, whereby Pol II poising is directly coupled to relaxed bidirectional transcription.

Cell cycle progression driven via Rb pathway forces neurons to undergo S-phase, resulting in cell death associated with the progression of neuronal degeneration. Nevertheless, some Rb- and Rb family (Rb, p107, and p130)-deficient differentiating neurons can proliferate and form tumors. Here, we found that differentiating cerebral cortical excitatory neurons underwent S-phase progression but not cell division after acute Rb family inactivation in differentiating neurons. However, the differentiating neurons underwent cell division and form tumors when Rb family members were inactivated in cortical progenitors. Differentiating neurons generated from Rb -/-; p107 -/-; p130 -/- (Rb-TKO) progenitors, but not acutely inactivated Rb-TKO differentiating neurons, activated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway without increasing the tri-methylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20M3), which is known to protect from DNA damage. The activation of DSB repair pathway was essential for the cell division of Rb-TKO differentiating neurons. These results suggest that newly-born cortical neurons from progenitors epigenetically become protected from DNA damage and cell division in a Rb family-dependent manner. 3 samples of pCAG-control, pCAG-RbTKO, pMAP2-control, and pMAP2-RbTKO cells .. cortical explant cell;  Rb-TKO;  control;  pCAG-Cre;  pMAP2-Cre;  total RNA;  Cortical explant Rb-TKO cells labeled by pCAG-Cre;  Cortical explant Rb-TKO cells labeled by pMAP2-Cre;  Cortical explant control cells labeled by pCAG-Cre;  Cortical explant control cells labeled by pMAP2-Cre;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;

HI, occurring during the perinatal period, severely affects brain integrity resulting in detrimental long-term neurological morbidity in terms of motor, intellectual, educational and neuropsychological performance deficits (e.g. cerebral palsy, mental retardation, learning disability and epilepsy), and even neonatal mortality  (Cowan et al., 2003; Ferriero, 2004; van Handel et al., 2007; Shalak and Perlman, 2004).

Active enhancers are further marked by H3K27ac. However, the methyltransferases responsible for the deposition of H3K4me1/2 on enhancers remain elusive. Furthermore, the functions of these methyltransferases on enhancers and associated cell-type-specific gene expression are poorly understood. Here, we identify MLL4 (KMT2D) as a major H3K4 mono- and di-methyltransferase in mammalian cells. Using adipogenesis and myogenesis as model systems, we show that MLL4 exhibits cell-type- and differentiation-stage-specific genomic binding and is predominantly localized on enhancers. MLL4 co-localizes with lineage-determining transcription factors (TFs) on active enhancers during differentiation. Deletion of MLL4 dramatically decreases H3K4me1/2 and H3K27ac on enhancers and leads to severe defects in cell-type-specific gene expression and cell differentiation. Finally, we provide evidence that lineage-determining TFs recruit and require MLL4 to establish enhancers critical for cell-type-specific gene expression. Together, these results identify MLL4 as an H3K4 mono-/di-methyltransferase required for enhancer activation during cell differentiation.

To examine the role of BLIMP1 in innate immunity we used a conditional knockout (CKO) of Blimp1 in myeloid cells and found that Blimp1 CKO mice were protected from lethal infection induced by Listeria monocytogenes. Transcriptome analysis of Blimp1 CKO macrophages identified the murine chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 8, CCL8 as a direct target of Blimp1-mediated transcriptional repression in these cells. BLIMP1-deficient macrophages expressed elevated levels of Ccl8 and consequently Blimp1 CKO mice had higher levels of circulating CCL8 resulting in increased neutrophils in the peripheral blood, promoting a more aggressive anti-bacterial response. Mice lacking the Ccl8 gene were more susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection than wild type mice. While CCL8 failed to recruit neutrophils directly, it was chemotactic for   /   T cells and CCL8-responsive   /   T cells were enriched for IL-17F. Finally, CCL8-mediated enhanced clearance of L. monocytogenes was dependent on   /   T cells. Collectively, these data reveal an important role for BLIMP1 in modulating host-defenses by suppressing expression of the chemokine CCL8.

Results: High-fat diet (HFD) caused insulin resistance and severe hepatic lipid accumulation, but respiratory chain parameters were unchanged. Livers from insulin-resistant IR/IRS-1+/- mice had normal lipid contents and normal respiratory chain parameters, however showed mitochondrial uncoupling. Livers from severely hyperglycemic and hypoinsulimic, streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice had massively depleted lipid levels, but respiratory chain abundance was unchanged. However, their mitochondria showed increased abundance and activity of the respiratory chain, which was better coupled compared to controls.  Conclusions: Insulin resistance, either induced by obesity or by genetic manipulation, does not cause mitochondrial dysfunction in the liver of mice. However, severe insulin deficiency and high blood glucose levels in mice cause an enhanced performance of the respiratory chain, probably in order to maintain the high energy requirement of the unsuppressed gluconeogenesis.

Subsequently, activation of imprinted Dlk-Dio3 gene cluster has been suggested to correlate with the pluripotency of iPS cells1. However, evidence from recent studies has demonstrated that loss of imprinting at the Dlk-Dio3 locus did not correlate strictly with the reduced pluripotency of iPS cells. Therefore, it becomes indispensable to exploit other reliable molecular markers for evaluating the quality of iPS cells accurately. In the present study, we successfully utilize the sequential reprogramming approach and produce all-iPS mice to six generations using iPS cell lines derived from different cell lineages which contain the same proviral integration in the genome. By comparing the global gene expression and epigenetic modifications of both    tetra-on    and corresponding    tetra-off    iPS cell lines established from either mesenchymal or hematopoietic lineages through deep sequencing analysis of mRNA expression, small RNA profiling, histone modifications (H3K4m2, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) and DNA methylation, very few differences are detected among all the iPS cell lines investigated. However, we find that two imprinted genes, disruption of which correlate with the reduced pluripotency of iPS cells.

The ovary surface epithelium (OSE) undergoes ovulatory tear-and-remodelling throughout life. Resident stem cells drive such tissue homeostasis in many adult epithelia, but their existence in the ovary has yet to be definitively proven. Lgr5 marks stem cells in multiple epithelia. Here we use reporter mice and Single Molecule Florescent-in-Situ-Hybridization (FISH) to document candidate Lgr5+ stem cells within the mouse ovary and associated structures. Lgr5 is broadly expressed during ovary organogenesis, but becomes limited to the OSE in early neonate life. In adults, Lgr5 expression is predominantly restricted to proliferative regions of the OSE and fimbria- mesovarian junction. Using conditional in vivo lineage tracing we identify embryonic and early neonate Lgr5+ populations as stem/progenitor cells contributing to the development of adult OSE and granulosa cell lineages, as well as the epithelia of the mesovarian and oviduct including its distal opening, fimbria. Long-term lineage tracing reveals that adult OSE-resident Lgr5+ populations contribute to epithelial homeostasis and OSE regenerative repair in vivo. Thus, Lgr5 is a marker of stem/progenitor cells of the ovary and tubal epithelia. Ovarian surface epithelium from pooled batches of Lgr5-eGFP-CreERT2 mice (n=8, per array) were sorted for cells expressing either high or low EGFP.

DM is unusual because it is RNA-mediated disease due to the expression of C(C)UG expansion RNAs that inhibit the activities of the muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins. In mice, studies using Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 single knockouts have revealed that Mbnl1 plays a predominant role in skeletal and heart muscle alternative splicing regulation while Mbnl2 performs an analogous splicing function in the brain. However, Mbnl single knockout models fail to recapitulate the full-range of adult-onset DM muscle symptoms. Here, we report that Mbnl1; Mbnl2 double knockouts are embryonic lethal while Mbnl1-/-; Mbnl2+/- mice, which express no Mbnl1 and reduced levels of Mbnl2, are viable but develop cardinal features of adult-onset DM cardiac and skeletal muscle disease including reduced lifespan, heart conduction block, severe myotonia and progressive skeletal muscle weakness.

Although the transcriptional regulation has been extensively investigated, post-transcriptional mechanisms controlling the ESC state are poorly understood. Here we describe a critical role of the THO complex in ESC self-renewal and differentiation. We show that THO preferentially interacts with pluripotency gene transcripts through Thoc5, and is required for self-renewal by regulating their export and expression. During differentiation, THO loses its interaction with those transcripts due to reduced Thoc5 expression, which leads to decreased expression of pluripotency proteins and facilitates differentiation. Finally, THO is also important for the establishment of pluripotency, as its depletion inhibits somatic cell reprogramming and blastocyst development. Together, our data indicates that THO regulates pluripotency gene mRNA export to control ESC self-renewal and differentiation, and uncovers a novel mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation in stem cell fate specification.

Exon-level analysis is more complex than gene-level analysis. The number of probesets to be investigated is at least 10 times larger in number than gene-level probesets. Thus results, upon statistical analysis, are massively contaminated by type I statistical errors, i.e. false positive [Della Beffa et al. 2008]. Furthermore, exon-level probesets are based only on four probes, which makes exon-level signal summarization more noisy than gene-level, where signal summarization is based on the overall probes encompassed by all exons of a gene. To moderate these issues we have expanded the number of experimental replications: six for TuBo and passage 1 mammosphere, four for passage 3 mammosphere and three for passage 2 mammosphere. Furthermore, after data summarization with RMA and normalization with sketch quantile method, alternative splicing detection between epithelial and mammospheres passages, was assessed using MiDAS, a two way anova developed by Affymetrix for the detection of alternative splicing events. We considered suitable for further investigations the splicing events in common between the sets of exons detected as spliced in each of the following comparisons: E vs P1, E vs P2 and E vs P3. ..

Gene-level analysis|The efficacy of cancer treatments have improved constantly in the last decade. However, therapeutic resistance and the lack of curative treatments in metastatic disease, raises the question if conventional anticancer therapies target the right cells. Indeed, these treatments might miss cancer stem cells (CSCs), which might also represent a more chemoresistant and radioresistant subpopulation within cancer. In this view using vaccines in tertiary prevention of cancer, i.e. residual disease treatment, might be particularly effective if vaccine-elicited immune response is directed against CSC oncoantigens (OAs)     proteins required for the neoplastic process     the chance that the tumour will evade the vaccine should be reduced. An important task to devise effective CSC preventive vaccines is therefore the identification of CSC OAs. We used gene-level transcription profiling of TuBo epithelial cell and three mammosphere passages (P1, P2 and P3). This analysis allowed the identification of two new breast cancer CSC OAs: TMPRSS4 and xCT. Both genes are linked to invasion, migration and metastasis. These results were achieved integrating data derived by the analysis of transcription profile of CSCs derived by BALB-neuT mouse breast cancer model with meta-analyses of seven large independent breast tumour data sets. TuBo cell line (E) was compared to passage 1 (P1), 2 (P2) and 3 (P3) mammospheres (three independent experiments for each experimental condition). Transcription profiling was done using MouseWG-6 v2.0 Illumina beadchips. After normalization and removal of non significant probes (i.e. those not expressed and those not changing) differential expression between epithelial and mammospheres, was assessed using regularized t-test comparing each mammosphere passage with respect to TuBo cells using a FDR     0.05  together with an  log2(fold-change)    1. The union of the three sets of differentially expressed transcripts produced a total of 495 transcripts. ..

In this study we characterized gene expression in a subset of cells involved in fracture healing.   SMACreERT2 mice crossed with Ai9 reporter mice that express tdTomato fluorescent protein after Cre-mediated activation were used as an experimental model.   SMA-expressing cells were labeled by tamoxifen administration, then periosteal cells from the tibia were isolated two days later (controls), or tibial fractures were performed and periosteum/soft callus tissue was collected after 2 and 6 days. The tdTomato positive cell population was isolated by flow cytometry, and subjected to microarray analysis. Histology and cell surface marker analysis indicates that   SMACreERT2 labels a mainly mesenchymal population in the periosteum that expands after fracture, and contributes to both osteogenic and chondrogenic elements of the fracture callus. We were therefore able to examine gene expression in a defined population during the early stages of fracture healing. Total RNA was obtained from the tomato positive cells within the periosteal compartment of fractures from   SMACreERT2/Ai9 mice. Control animals were given 2 doses of tamoxifen, and periosteum was collected and labeled cells sorted (8-9 sex-matched mice per group).

The pre-CC is a proof-of-concept experiment involving CC lines that have undergone at least five generations of inbreeding. Siblings from these lines were each involved in one of four distinct phenotyping arms, then genotyped on a high-density Affymetrix platform. These mice were initially described in the following reference. Genome Research 2011 Aug;21(8):1213-22 (PMID: 21406540).  The goal of this specific project was to identify gene expression QTL using lung tissue from pre-CC mice that were sensitized and challenged with house dust mite allergen (namely, Der p 1). We analyzed whole lung RNAs from 138 pre-Collaborative Cross mice using Illumina WG6v2 arrays. Pre-Collaborative Cross (CC) mice are partially inbred strains created by intercrossing eight founder (parental) strains: 129S1/SvImJ, (129S1), A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), CAST/Ei (CAST), NOD/LtJ (NOD), NZO/H1LtJ (NZO), PWK/Ph (PWK), and WSB/Ei (WSB).

Although alternative splicing is pervasive and known to contribute to a variety of pathologies, including cancer, the genetic context for individual differences in isoform usage is still evolving. Similarly, although mRNA editing is ubiquitous and associated with important biological processes such as intracellular viral replication and cancer development, individual variations in and the genetic transmissibility of mRNA editing are equivocal. Here, we have used linkage analysis to show that both mRNA editing and alternative splicing are regulated by the macrophage genetic background and environmental cues. We show that distinct loci, potentially harboring variable splice factors, regulate the splicing of multiple transcripts. Additionally, we show that individual genetic variability at the Apobec1 locus results in differential rates of C-to-U(T) editing in murine macrophages; with mouse strains expressing mostly a truncated isoform of Apobec1 exhibiting lower rates of editing. As a proof of concept, we have used linkage analysis to identify 36 high confidence novel edited sites. These results provide a novel and complementary method that can be used to identify C-to-U editing sites in individuals segregating at specific loci and show that, beyond individual DNA sequence and structural changes, differential isoform usage and mRNA editing can contribute to intra-species genomic and phenotypic diversity.

However, little attention has been paid to the ability of these two strategies in rejuvenating cells from donors with aging associated syndrome. Here, we utilized telomerase deficient (Terc-/-) mice to probe this question. SCNT-derived embryonic stem cells (ntESCs) and iPSCs were successfully derived from second generation (G2) and third generation (G3) of Terc-/- mice, and ntESCs showed better differentiation potential and self-renewal ability. Telomeres lengthened extensively in cloned embryos while remained or slightly increased in the process of iPSCs induction. Furthermore, G3 ntESCs exhibited improvement of telomere capping function as evidenced by decreased signal free ends and chromosome end-to-end fusion events. In contrast, there was a further decline of telomere capping function in G3 iPSCs. In addition to telomere dysfunction, mitochondria function was severely impaired in G3 iPSCs as evidenced by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) decline, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and dramatically increased mitochondria genome mutations while these deficiencies were greatly mitigated in G3 ntESCs. Our data proved the principle that SCNT-mediated reprogramming appears more superior than transcription factors induced reprogramming in terms of the resetting of telomere quality and mitochondria function, and thus, providing valuable information for further improvement of transcription factors mediated reprogramming.

Yet, endogenous RNAi is highly active in oocytes but not in somatic cells. Here, we provide a mechanistical explanation for high RNAi activity in mouse oocytes. The main Dicer isoform in oocytes is transcribed from an intronic MT-C retrotransposon, which functions as a promoter of an oocyte-specific Dicer isoform (denoted DicerO). DicerO lacks an N-terminal helicase domain and has a higher cleavage activity than the full-length Dicer from somatic cells.  DicerO can rescue the miRNA pathway and, in addition, it efficiently produces small RNAs from long dsRNA substrates. Thus, control of endogenous RNAi activity in mice occurs via alternative Dicer isoform and the phylogenetic origin of DicerO demonstrates evolutionary plasticity of RNA silencing pathways.

We have adapted these GEM models to orthotopic allografts that uniformly develop tumors with short latency in immunocompetent recipients and are ideally suited for routine preclinical studies. To monitor passaged tumors at the molecular level, we analyzed transcriptional profiles of a set of primary SEOC and matching derived passaged tumors. We have merged this dataset with previously published ( doi:  10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-3834; PMID 22617326) dataset of murine primary ovarian tumors from our GEM models (GSE46169) and merged and compared them to expression profiles of human dataset published previously (doi:  10.1038/nature10166). The high mortality rate from ovarian cancers can be attributed to late-stage diagnosis and lack of effective treatment. Despite enormous effort to develop better targeted therapies, platinum-based chemotherapy still remains the standard of care for ovarian cancer patients, and resistance occurs at a high rate. One of the rate limiting factors for translation of new drug discoveries into clinical treatments has been the lack of suitable preclinical cancer models with high predictive value.

Here, we describe an adaptation of these GEM models to orthotopic allografts that uniformly develop tumors with short latency and are ideally suited for routine preclinical studies.

We used the paradigmatic 'GATA-PU.1 axis    to explore, at systems-level, dynamic relationships between transcription factor (TF) binding and global gene expression programs as multipotent cells differentiate. We combined global ChIPSeq of GATA1, GATA2 and PU.1 with expression profiling during differentiation to erythroid and neutrophil lineages. Our analysis reveals (i)  differential complexity of sequence motifs bound by GATA1, GATA2 and PU.1; (ii) the scope and interplay of the GATA1 and GATA2 programs within, and during transitions between, different cell compartments, and the extent of their hard-wiring by DNA motifs; (iii) the potential to predict gene expression trajectories based on global associations between TF-binding data and target gene expression and (iv) how dynamic modeling of DNA-binding and gene expression data can be used to infer regulatory logic of TF circuitry.

Mice with iron deficiency anemia (IDA)-low hepcidin show a pro-inflammatory response that is blunted in iron deficienct-high hepcidin Tmprss6 null mice. We investigated the transcriptional response associated with chronic hepcidin overexpression by comparing whole genome transcription profiling of the liver of Tmprss6 KO mice and IDA animals, irrespective of iron deficiency.

Finally, in the absence of TRIM28 we observed increased apoptosis as well as diminished expression of multiple erythroid transcription factors and heme biosynthetic enzymes in immature erythroid cells. Thus, TRIM28 is essential for the cell-autonomous development of immature erythroblasts in the bone marrow. To induce Cre recombinase from the Mx1Cre transgene, poly(I:C) was injected 5 times every other day. Mice were analyzed two weeks after completion of poly(I:C) administration. TRIM28 mutant mice generate two distinct types of immature erythroid cells; KOa, with 5-8% of the Trim28 gene remaining undeleted (still bearing 26% of residual mRNA), and KOb, with 1-4% of the gene remaining undeleted (and with 18% of mRNA remaining). ..

Background: Acetyltransferase p300 is a central driver of the hypertrophic response to increased workload, but its biological targets and downstream effectors are incompletely known.  Methods and Results: Mice expressing a myocyte-restricted transgene encoding acetyltransferase p300, previously shown to develop spontaneous hypertrophy, were observed to undergo robust compensatory blood vessel growth together with increased angiogenic gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated binding of p300 to the enhancers of the angiogenic regulators Angpt1 and Egln3. Interestingly, p300 overexpression in vivo was also associated with relative upregulation of several members of the anti-angiogenic miR-17~92 cluster in vivo.  Confirming this finding, both miR-17-3p and miR-20a were upregulated in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes following adenoviral transduction of p300. Relative expression of most members of the 17~92 cluster was similar in all 4 cardiac chambers and in other organs, however, significant downregulation of miR-17-3p and miR-20a occurred between 1 and 8 months of age in both wt and tg mice. The decline in expression of these microRNAs was associated with increased expression of VEGFA, a validated miR-20a target. In addition, miR-20a was demonstrated to directly repress p300 expression through a consensus binding site in the p300 3   UTR. In vivo transduction of p300 resulted in repression both of p300 and of p300-induced angiogenic transcripts.  Conclusion: p300 drives an angiogenic transcription program during hypertrophy that is fine-tuned in part through direct repression of p300 by miR-20a. 4 littermates, 3 transgene-expressing and 1 wild-type were analyzed.  Samples were spotted in duplicate. ..

In this study we show that selective deletion of PRMT5 in different organs leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. At the molecular level, PRMT5 depletion results in reduced methylation of Sm proteins, aberrant constitutive splicing and in the Alternative Splicing (AS) of specific mRNAs. We identify Mdm4 as one of these mRNAs, which due to its weak 5   -Donor site, acts as a sensor of splicing defects and transduces the signal to activate the p53 response, providing a mechanistic explanation of the phenotype observed in PRMT5 conditional knockout mice. Our data demonstrate a key role of PRMT5, together with p53, as guardians of the transcriptome. This will have fundamental implications in our understanding of PRMT5 activity, both in physiological conditions, as well as pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological diseases.

A promising approach, which may to a certain degree reduce the need for animal studies in the future is toxicogenomics. The idea is to employ microarray platforms for the genome-wide expression profiling of compounds, which may facilitate the discovery of biomarker genes and provide insights in molecular mechanisms. We profiled global mRNA expression in the liver of male and female CD-1 mice treated with genotoxic, nongenotoxic, and non-hepatocarcinogenic compounds up to two weeks. Diverse compounds were administrated to male and female mice CD-1 mice by oral gavage up to 14 days. In order to chose appropriate dose levels for the carcinogenic substances, the dose reported to be carcinogenic in the 2-year mouse bioassay as stated in the CPDB database (http://potency.berkeley.edu/) was used.  To ensure clearly visible changes in gene expression in response to treatment with non-hepatocarcinogens, a high dose was used for these compounds. After 3 and 14 days of treatment, respectively, the animals were anesthetized using isoflurane, exsanguinated from the heart and then subjected to necropsy.

Hypoxia adaptation, conferred through the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), appears to be insufficient. Here we show that HIF activation in renal tubules through Pax8-rtTA-based inducible knockout of von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL-KO) protects from rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI. In this model, histological observations indicate that injury mainly affects proximal convoluted tubules, with 5% necrosis at d1 and 40% necrosis at d2. HIF-1alpha up-regulation in distal tubules reflects renal hypoxia. However, lack of HIF in proximal tubules suggests insufficient adaptation by HIF. AKI in VHL-KO mice leads to prominent HIF activation in all nephron segments, as well as to reduced serum creatinine, serum urea, tubular necrosis, and apoptosis marker caspase-3 protein. At d1 after rhabdomyolysis, when tubular injury is potentially reversible, HIF mediated protection in AKI is associated with activated glycolysis, cellular glucose uptake and utilization, autophagy, vasodilation, and proton removal as demonstrated by qPCR, pathway enrichment analysis and immunohistochemistry. Together, our data provide evidence for a HIF-orchestrated multi-level shift towards glycolysis as a major mechanism for protection against acute tubular injury. All experiments were carried out in transgenic mice in which selective renal tubular VHL knockout (VHL-KO) was inducible by doxycycline (Reference: Mathia S, Paliege A, Koesters R, Peters H, Neumayer HH, Bachmann S, Rosenberger C. Action of hypoxia-inducible factor in liver and kidney from mice with Pax8-rtTA-based deletion of von Hippel-Lindau protein. Acta Physiol (Oxf). 2013; 207(3):565-76.).

We used a functional genomics to link gene expression patterns taken from microarray data to the severity and persistence of ER stress, using mice lacking the UPR signaling molecule ATF6  .

However, elevated levels of 5hmC within neural tissues suggest that the mark is stable and may directly contribute to gene regulation. Here, we characterize the  in vivo  genomic patterning and stability of 5hmC in three defined developmental states of the mouse main olfactory epithelium     multipotent stem cells, neuronal progenitors, and mature olfactory sensory neurons. 5hmC is globally enriched in neuronal progenitors and neurons relative to the stem population with significant enrichment on the bodies of transcriptionally active genes and intergenic enhancers. Although gene body 5hmC levels are positively correlated with cell type-specific gene expression in all developmental stages, genes that are commonly expressed within both neuronal progenitors and mature neurons experience the greatest increases in 5hmC levels. Moreover, enriched levels of the modified base on intergenic conserved regions correlate with cell type-specific expression of nearby genes and coincide with developmentally regulated enhancer-promoter interaction at one locus examined. Finally, an analysis of two-month old neurons indicates that elevated 5hmC levels persist in fully differentiated neurons. Together, these data suggest that 5hmC stabilizes the expression of developmentally active genes through effects at both gene bodies and intergenic regulatory elements. 9 Samples .. 4 weeks;  Neurog1-EGFP positive cells;  OMP-ires-EGFP positive cells;  anti-CD54-PE positive cells;  anti-5hmC antibody (Active Motif);  anti-5mC antibody (Active Motif);  genomic DNA;  total RNA;  Neurog1-EGFP positive cells;  OMP-ires-EGFP positive cells;  anti-CD54-PE positive cells;  10090;  Mus musculus;  main olfactory epithelium;

Cells at the site of amputation form a blastema and then proliferate and differentiate to regrow the limb. To better understand this process, we have performed deep RNA sequencing of the blastema over a time course. We find genes expressed in three phases with a prominent burst in oncogene expression during the first day, blastemal/limb bud genes peaking at 7 to 14 days, and markers for terminal differentiation upregulated later. We compare these expression patterns to those in a mouse digit amputation model to identify genes specific to the regenerative response. We find that limb patterning genes, SALL genes, and genes involved in the proteasome, adult stem cell, embryonic stem cell, retinoid metabolism, and WNT and NOTCH signaling are regeneration-specific. We establish the    Axolomics    Database, which provides a tool for depositing, retrieving, and searching axolotl-related    omic    information. The experiment includes two time course data sets.

Post surgical buprenorphine and baytril were administered for 3 days post-surgery for analgesia and antibiotic prophylaxis, respectively. Animals were sacrificed and the distal portion of each amputated digit (distal to the proximal joint) was harvested into RNAlater solution (Ambion, Austin, TX) and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Time points of harvest included 0 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 5 days, 10 days, and 14 days. Following transfer of each sample overnight on dry ice to the Morgridge Institute for Research  (Madison, WI), RNA from each sample was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and treated with Dnase I. Then the RNA was purified by extraction with phenol:chloroform.For Axolotl: For all surgical procedures, the animals were anesthetized with 0.5-1 g/L Tricaine (MS-222, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) until they were unresponsive to a tail pinch stimulus.We amputated juvenile limbs at the mid-stylopod level. Tissue was harvested as described in Figure 1 at 0 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days. Note that for the early time points, some tissue was harvested proximal to the original amputation plane owing to the small amount of regenerative tissue distal to the amputation plane at the time of harvesting. In all cases the harvested tissues were stored in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 4OC until the RNA was purified using the RNeasy purification kit from Qiagen.;

We have studied the effects of inhibitors of Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) and Topoisomerase 2 (Top2) enzymes on mouse cortical neurons. We find that topoisomerases selectively inhibit long genes (>100kb), with little effect on all other gene expression. Using ChIPseq against RNA Polymerase II (Pol2) we show that the Top1 inhibitor topotecan blocks transcriptional elongation of long genes specifically. Many of the genes inhibited by topotecan are candidate ASD genes, leading us to propose that topoisomerase inhibition might contribute to ASD pathology.

Treatment with a pan deubiquitinase (DUB) inhibitor, or knockdown of USP7, decreases adipogenesis. Transcriptome analysis reveals a common set of cell cycle genes to be co-regulated by both Tip60 and USP7.

Tregs are therefore promising targets to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Histone/protein acetyltransferases (HATs) promote chromatin accessibility, gene transcription and the function of multiple transcription factors and non-histone proteins. We found that conditional deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of one specific HAT, p300, in Foxp3+ Tregs, increased TCR-induced apoptosis in Tregs, impaired Treg suppressive function and iTreg peripheral conversion, and limited tumor growth in immunocompetent, but not in immunodeficient, hosts.

Here, experiments using crypt-villus organoids that lack nerve and immune cells in culture led us to suggest that endogenous ACh is synthesized in the intestinal epithelium to evoke growth and differentiation of the organoids through activation of muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs). The extracts of the cultured organoids exhibit a noticeable capacity for ACh synthesis that is sensitive to a potent inhibitor of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Imaging mass spectrometry reveals distribution of endogenous ACh that is localized in intestinal epithelial layer in the cultured organoids as well as in mouse small intestinal epithelium in vivo, suggesting non-neural resources of ACh. Treatment of organoids with carbachol down-regulates growth of organoids and expression of marker gene for each epithelial cell. On the other hand, antagonists for mAChRs enhances growth and differentiation of organoids, indicating involvement of mAChRs in regulating proliferation and differentiation of Lgr5-positive stem cells.

However, relatively little is known about the role that lincRNAs play in this pathway. Here we characterize a lincRNA named PINT (p53 Induced Noncoding Transcript). We show that PINT is a ubiquitously expressed lincRNA that is finely regulated by p53. In mouse cells, PINT promotes cell proliferation and survival by regulating the expression of genes of TGF-beta, MAPK and p53 pathways. PINT is a nuclear lincRNA that directly interacts with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), being required for PRC2 targeting of specific genes for repression. Furthermore, PINT functional activity is dependent on PRC2 expression, representing a connection between the p53 pathway and epigenetic regulation by PRC2. We have also identified PINT human ortholog (hPINT), which presents suggestive analogies with the mouse lincRNA. hPINT is similarly regulated by p53, and its expression correlates significantly with the same cellular pathways as the mouse ortholog, including the p53 pathway. Interestingly, hPINT is significantly downregulated in colon cancer, representing a novel tumor suppressor candidate. Our results not only help our understanding of the role of p53 and lincRNAs in cancer, but also contribute to the open debate regarding the utility of mouse models for the study of lincRNAs.

In specific-pathogen free (SPF) non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice females have 1.3-4.4 times higher incidence of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Germ-free (GF) mice lose the gender bias (female/male ratio 1.1-1.2). Gut microbiota differed in males and females, a trend reversed by male castration, confirming that androgens influence gut microbiota. Colonization of GF NOD mice with defined microbiota revealed that some but not all lineages overrepresented in male mice supported a gender bias in T1D, and protection did not correlate with androgen levels. However, hormone-supported selective microbial lineage variation may work as a positive feedback mechanism contributing to the sexual dimorphism of autoimmune diseases. Gene expression analysis suggested pathways involved in protection of males from T1D by microbiota. We compared gene expression patterns in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) between four groups of mice (two genders in SPF and GF conditions, respectively).

Although the transcription factor Pax6 was implicated in both proliferation and differentiation of multiple regions within the CNS, its contribution to the transition between these successive states remains elusive. To gain insight into the role of Pax6 during the transition from proliferating progenitors to differentiating precursors, we investigated cell-cycle and transcriptomic changes occurring in Pax6- retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Our analyses revealed a unique cell-cycle phenotype of the Pax6-deficient RPCs, which included a reduced number of cells in the S phase, an increased number of cells exiting the cell cycle, and delayed differentiation kinetics of Pax6- precursors. These alterations were accompanied by co-expression of factors that promote (Ccnd1, Ccnd2, Ccnd3) and inhibit (P27kip1 and P27kip2) the cell cycle. Further characterization of the changes in transcription profile of the Pax6-deficient RPCs revealed abrogated expression of multiple factors which are known to be involved in regulating proliferation of RPCs, including the transcription factors Vsx2, Nr2e1, Plagl1 and Hedgehog signaling. These findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism mediating the pleiotropic activity of Pax6 in RPCs. The results further suggest that rather than conveying a linear effect on RPCs, such as promoting their proliferation and inhibiting their differentiation, Pax6 regulates multiple transcriptional networks which function simultaneously, thereby conferring the capacity to proliferate, assume multiple cell fates and execute the differentiation program into retinal lineages. The data contains 3 control and 3 Pax6 negative samples representing biological repeats.

However the molecular logic of neurogenic fate determination is still ill understood, even though some key transcription factors have been implicated. Here we describe how one of these, the transcription factor Pax6, regulates adult neurogenesis by initiating a cross-regulatory network of 3 transcription factors executing neuronal fate and regulating genes required for neuronal differentiation. This network is initiated and driven to sufficiently high expression levels by the transcription factor Pax6 in close interaction with Brg1-containing SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factors. Genetic deletion of either Pax6 or Brg1, the ATPase unit of the SWI/SNF complex, in neural stem cells of the adult mouse subependymal zone results in a fate conversion to distinct glial subtypes most pronounced when neuroblasts leave the neurogenic niche. Consistent with the phenocopy in vivo virtually all genes down-regulated by Brg1 deletion have Pax6-binding motifs. Amongst the few down-stream transcription factors are Sox11, Nfib and Brn4 that crossregulate each other and rescue neurogenesis also in direct reprogramming in the absence of Brg1 (or Pax6). Thus the function of Pax6-SWI/SNF is necessary and sufficient for neuronal fate maintenance and initiates a cross-regulatory effector network required for neuronal fate execution and maintenance to counteract glial differentiation in the adult brain. This identifies a novel role highly specific role of a chromatin-remodelling complex in stabilizing fate decisions in normal and forced neurogenesis.

Here, we report that starting chronic treatment with low dose of metformin (0.1% w/w in diet) at one year of age extends health and lifespan in male mice, while a higher dose (1% w/w) was toxic. Treatment with low dose metformin mimicked some of the benefits of calorie restriction, such as improved physical performance, increased insulin sensitivity, and reduced LDL and cholesterol levels. At a molecular level, metformin increased AMP-activated protein kinase activity without attenuation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain activities. Metformin treatment resulted in lower chronic inflammation and increased antioxidant protection, suggesting that the ability of metformin to improve health of laboratory animals may stem from these factors. Our results support that metformin supplementation could be beneficial in extending health and lifespan in humans. Groups of one-year old male B6C57/J mice were maintained on ad libitum AIN-93G SD diet, or a 40% caloric restriction of the AIN-93G SD diet, or an ad libitum AIN-93G diet supplemented with 0.1% w/w metformin for the rest of their lives.  5 mice from each of these 3 groups were selected and RNA was extracted from both muscle and liver tissue using 1.0mm glass beads in a Precellys 24 Tissue Homogenizer  and Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kits for Fibrous Tissue according to manufacturer's specifications.

In short, 0.5g of total RNA was first converted into single-stranded cDNA with reverse transcriptase using an oligo-dT primer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter site and then copied to produce double-stranded cDNA molecules. The double stranded cDNA was cleaned and concentrated with the supplied columns and used in an overnight in-vitro transcription reaction where single-stranded RNA (cRNA) was generated and labeled by incorporation of biotin-16-UTP.  Arrays were hybridized using a total of 0.75ug of biotin-labeled cRNA at 58 degrees C for 16 hours to Illumina's Sentrix MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChips. Each BeadChip has ~24,000 well-annotated RefSeq transcripts with approximately 30-fold redundancy. The arrays were washed, blocked and the biotin labeled cRNA was detected by staining with streptavidin-Cy3.  Arrays were scanned at a resolution of 0.8um using the Beadstation 500 X from Illumina and the data was extracted using the Illumina GenomeStudio software(v1.6.0).  Any spots at or below the background were filtered out using an Illumina detection p value of 0.02 and above. The natural log of all remaining scores were used to find the avg and std of each array and the z-score normalization was calculated and presented below.

However, whole mouse genome studies of gene expression in otitis media have not previously been undertaken. Ninety-nine percent of mouse genes are shared in the human, so these studies are relevant to the human condition. Methods: To assess inflammation-driven processes in the mouse ear, gene chip analyses were conducted on mice treated with trans-tympanic heat-killed Hemophilus influenza using untreated mice as controls. Middle and inner ear tissues were separately harvested at 6 hours, RNA extracted, and samples for each treatment processed on the Affymetrix 430 2.0 Gene Chip for expression of its 34,000 genes. Results:  Statistical analysis of gene expression compared to control mice showed significant alteration of gene expression in 2,355 genes, 11% of the genes tested and 8% of the mouse genome.    Significant middle and inner ear upregulation (fold change >1.5, p<0.05) was seen in 1,081 and 599 genes respectively.  Significant middle and inner ear downregulation (fold change <0.67, p<0.05) was seen in 978 and 287 genes respectively. While otitis media is widely believed to be an exclusively middle ear process with little impact on the inner ear, the inner ear changes noted in this study were numerous and discrete from the middle ear responses. This suggests that the inner ear does indeed respond to otitis media and that its response is a distinctive process.  Numerous new genes, previously not studied, are found to be affected by inflammation in the ear. Conclusion: Whole genome analysis via gene chip allows simultaneous examination of expression of hundreds of gene families influenced by inflammation in the middle ear.  Discovery of new gene families affected by inflammation may lead to new approaches to the study and treatment of otitis media.

We next observed how the microglai transcriptomes change during activation in the SOD1-G93A mouse model of motor neuron degeneration at 3 timepoints.  We also compared these profiles with that induced by LPS injection. Results and conclusions:  ALS microglia were found to differ substantially from those activated by LPS and from M1/M2 macrophages by comparison with published datasets. These ALS microglia showing substantial induction of a "neurodegeneration-tailored phenotype", with induction of lysosomal, RNA splicing, and Alzheimer's disease pathway genes.  Overall they express a mixture of neuroprotective and neurotoxic factors during activation in ALS mice, showing that neuro-immune activation in the spinal cord is a double-edged sword.  We also detected the transcriptional nature of surface marker expression in microglia (CD11b, CD86, CD11c), and substantial T-cell microglia cross-talk using correlative microglia transcriptome/FACS analysis. 42 total RNA samples from purified spinal cord microglia were subjected to paired-end RNA-sequencing.

We previously reported that systemic injection of LV triggers a transient inflammatory response. Here, we carried out studies to better characterize this response, and to develop a strategy to overcome the effects of interferon (IFN) on LV-mediated gene transfer. We profiled gene expression in the liver after LV administration using deep-sequencing, and identified several innate response pathways. We examined the response to LV in MyD88-TRIF knock-out mice, which are incapable of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. The IFN response to LV was not reduced in the liver, indicating that a non-TLR pathway can recognize LV in this tissue. Indeed, blocking reverse-transcription with AZT reduced the IFN response only in the liver, suggesting that proviral DNA can be a trigger. To block the inflammatory response, we pre-treated mice with a short-course of dexamethasone. At 4 hours post-treatment, all of the IFN-induced genes were normalized. By blocking the inflammatory response, hepatocyte transduction was dramatically increased, which doubled the level of human factor-IX produced by a hepatocyte-specific LV. Our studies uncover new insights into LV-induced immune responses in the liver, and provide a means to increase the safety and efficiency of LV-mediated gene transfer. mRNA profiles from livers of untreated and LV-treated mice were generated by deep-sequencing in Illumina HiSeq 2000. .. total RNA;  Liver, LV;  Liver, untreated;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  lentiviral vector (LV);  __untreated;  Mice were intravenously injected with 3x10^8 transducing units (TU) of a LV vector and sacrificed 4h later.;

We show that genetic disruption of all three pathways, which frequently occurs in human GBM, leads to maximal in vitro growth, migration, and invasion and produces stem-like transcriptomal profiles similar to the proneural subtype of human GBM.  Genetic alterations in all three pathways are also required for efficient tumorigenesis in an orthotopic syngeneic allograft model system in vivo.  These findings show that cortical astrocytes can form GBM and identify a potential model for proneural GBM that can be used to test subtype-specific therapies. Transcriptional profiling of transformed murine cortical astrocytes shows correlation between mutated genes, invasive capability, neural lineage, and human astrocytoma/GBM signatures.  10 samples Cortical astrocytes were isolated from neonatal mice (C57BL/6 background strain) and cultured.

Regulatory proteins, such as KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP), modulate rates and timing of the enzymatic reactions responsible for maturation of select miRNAs from their primary transcripts in response to specific stimuli. Induction of myogenic miRNAs (myomiRs) is essential for muscle differentiation with KSRP phosphorylation being required to convey myogenic signals to enhanced myomiR maturation. Here we show that either KSRP silencing or Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)2-signaling activation in mesenchimal C2C12 cells prevented myogenic differentiation while induced osteoblastic differentiation as revealed by the reshaping of the whole transcriptome analyzed by RNA deep-sequencing. The most striking feature common to both BMP2 signaling activation and KSRP silencing was a blockade of myomiR maturation. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylated SMAD proteins, the transducers of BMP signaling, associate with KSRP and block its interaction with primary-myomiRs. This, in turn, abrogates KSRP-dependent myomiR maturation with the knock-down of SMAD4, 5, and 9 being able to rescue KSRP function. SMAD-induced blockade of KSRP-dependent myomiR maturation, in parallel to the well known SMAD function on gene transcription, inhibits C2C12 cell differentiation into myofibers and contributes to orient cells towards osteoblast lineage. We propose that remodeling of co-regulatory complexes affecting primary-miRNA processing is a mechanism well suited to guide cell fate determination in eukaryotes.

Here we show that cell competition is a novel mechanism regulating the fitness of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We find that ESCs displaying defective BMP signalling, defective autophagy or are tetraploid are eliminated at the onset of differentiation by wild-type cells. This elimination occurs in an apoptotic dependent manner and is mediated by secreted factors. Furthermore, during this process we find that establishment of differential cMyc levels is critical and that cMyc over-expression is sufficient to induce competitive behaviour in ESCs. Cell competition is therefore a process that allows recognition and elimination of defective cells during the early stages of development and is likely to play important roles in tissue homeostasis and stem cell maintenance. We used microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles of Bmpr1a-/- and control embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the ESC state and after differentiation in N2B27 Microarray profiles of control and Bmpr1a-/- mouse embryonic stem cells in embryonic stem cell culture media and in N2B27 ..

The cellular and molecular responses of the kidney to congenital obstruction are incompletely characterized. In this study, we evaluated global transcription in kidneys with graded hydronephrosis in the megabladder (mgb-/-) mouse to better understand the pathophysiology of congenital obstructive nephropathy. Three primary pathways associated with kidney remodeling/repair were induced in mgb-/- kidneys independent of the degree of hydronephrosis. These pathways included retinoid signaling, steroid hormone metabolism, and renal response to injury. Urothelial proliferation and the expression of genes with roles in the integrity and maintenance of the renal urothelium were selectively increased in mgb-/- kidneys. Ngal/Lcn2, a marker of acute kidney injury, was elevated in 36% of kidneys with higher grades of hydronephrosis. Evaluation of Ngalhigh versus Ngallow kidneys identified the expression of several novel candidate markers of renal injury. This study indicates that the development of progressive hydronephrosis in mgb-/- mice results in renal adaptation that includes significant changes in the morphology and potential functionality of the renal urothelium. These observations will permit the development of novel biomarkers and therapeutic approaches to progressive renal injury in the context of congenital obstruction.

ChIP followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is a powerful, unbiased method to map transfactor occupancy. We used ChIP-Seq to study the interactome of EKLF in mouse erythroid progenitor cells and more differentiated erythroblasts. We correlated these results with the nuclear distribution of EKLF, RNA-Seq analysis of the transcriptome, and the occupancy of other erythroid transcription factors. In progenitor cells, EKLF is found predominantly at the periphery of the nucleus, where EKLF primarily occupies the promoter regions of genes and acts as a transcriptional activator. In erythroblasts, EKLF is distributed throughout the nucleus, and erythroblast-specific EKLF occupancy is predominantly in intragenic regions. In progenitor cells, EKLF modulates general cell growth and cell cycle regulatory pathways, whereas in erythroblasts EKLF is associated with repression of these pathways. The EKLF interactome shows very little overlap with the interactomes of GATA1, GATA2, or TAL1, leading to a model in which EKLF directs programs that are independent of those regulated by the GATA factors or TAL1. (Blood.2011;118(17):e139-e148) We used ChIP-Seq to study the interactome of EKLF in mouse erythroid progenitor cells and more differentiated erythroblasts and RNA-Seq analysis of the transcriptome. ..

In addition, many AHR target genes that have been identified by genome-wide profiling have morphogenetic functions, suggesting that AHR activation may play a role in embryonic development.  To address this hypothesis, we studied the consequences of AHR activation by TCDD, its prototypical ligand, during spontaneous mouse ES cell differentiation into contractile cardiomyocytes.  Treatment with TCDD or shRNA-mediated AHR knockdown significantly decreased the ability of cardiomyocytes to contract and the expression of cardiac markers in these cells.  An AHR-positive embryonic stem cell lineage was generated that expressed puromycin resistance and eGFP under the control of the AHR-responsive Cyp1a1 promoter.  Cells of this lineage were over 90% pure and expressed AHR as well as cardiomyocyte markers. Analysis of temporal trajectories of global gene expression in these cells shows that activation of the AHR/TCDD axis disrupts the concerted expression of genes that regulate multiple signaling pathways involved in cardiac and neural morphogenesis and differentiation, including dozens of genes encoding homeobox transcription factors and Polycomb and Trithorax Group genes.  More than 50% of the homeobox factors so regulated do not have AhRE sites in their promoters, indicating that AHR activation may establish a complex regulatory network that reaches beyond direct AHR signaling and is capable of disrupting various aspects of embryonic development, including cardiomyocyte differentiation. mRNA profiles of WT and selected AHR positive cells at different differentiation days treated with and without TCDD in duplicates ..

We are trying to detect potential salivary biomarkers in mice with a pancreatic tumor. Global gene expression profiling has shown great promise in high-throughput biomarker discovery for early disease detection in body fluids such as saliva, which is accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive. However, this goal has not been fully realized because saliva, like many clinical samples, contains partially fragmented and degraded RNAs that are difficult to amplify and detect with prevailing technologies. Here, using nanogram scale salivary RNA as a proof-of-principle example, we describe our progress with a novel poly-A tail independent mRNA amplification strategy combined with the Affymetrix GeneChip Exon arrays. We defined a Salivary Exon Core Transcriptome (SECT) with highly similar expression profiles in healthy individuals verified by quantitative PCR. Informatics analysis of SECT provided important mechanistic insight to their potential origin and function. Finally we demonstrated the diagnostic potential of true exon level expression profiling approach with salivary exon biomarkers that accurately discriminated gender in healthy individuals. Recent studies have demonstrated that discriminatory salivary biomarkers can be readily detected upon the development of systemic diseases such as pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer. However, the utility of salivary biomarkers for the detection of systemic diseases has been undermined due to the absence of biological and mechanistic rationale why distal diseases from the oral cavity would lead to the development of discriminatory biomarkers in saliva. Here, we examine the hypothesis that pancreatic tumor-derived exosomes are mechanistically involved in the development of pancreatic cancer-discriminatory salivary transcriptomic biomarkers. We first developed a pancreatic cancer mouse model that yielded discriminatory salivary biomarkers by implanting the mouse pancreatic cancer cell line Pan02 into the pancreas of the syngeneic host C57BL/6. The role of pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes in the development of discriminatory salivary biomarkers was then tested by engineered a Pan02 cell line that is suppressed for exosome biogenesis, implanted into the C56BL/6 mouse and examine if the discriminatory salivary biomarker profile was ablated or disrupted. Suppression of exosome biogenesis results in the ablation of discriminatory salivary biomarker development. This study supports that tumor-derived exosomes provide a mechanism in the development of discriminatory biomarkers in saliva and distal systemic diseases. We analyzed saliva from 6 healthy mice and 6 mice with a pancreatic tumor using the Affymetrix Mouse Exon Genome 430 2.0 platform. Array data was processed by dChip.

Alternative splicing contributes to muscle development and differentiation, but the complete set of muscle splicing factors and their combinatorial interactions are not known. Previously work identifies ACUAA (STAR motif) as an enriched sequence near muscle-specific alternative exons such as Capzb exon 9. We did mass spectrometry of proteins selected by wild type and mutant Capzb intron 9 RNA affinity chromatography, and identified Quaking (Qk), a protein known to regulate mRNA function through ACUAA motifs in 3' UTRs. We show that in myoblasts, Qk promotes inclusion of Capzb exon 9 in opposition to repression by PTB. Qk knockdown in myoblasts has little effect on transcript levels, but alters inclusion of 824 cassette exons whose adjacent intron sequences are enriched in ACUAA motifs. During differentiation to myotubes, Qk levels increase 2-3 fold, suggesting a mechanism for Qk-responsive exon regulation.  We captured the PTB splicing regulatory network and intersected it with the Qk network, identifying overlap between the functions of Qk and PTB. Approximately 60% of exons whose inclusion is altered during myogenesis appear to be under control of one or both of these splicing factors in myoblasts.

The key components of the thymus are cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cells (cTECs and mTECs). Despite the capital role of TECs, our understanding of TEC biology is quite rudimentary. For instance, we ignore what might be the extent of divergence in the functional program of these two TECs populations. It also remains unclear why the number of TECs decreases rapidly with age, thereby leading to progressive thymic insufficiency. Methods: Systems level understanding of cell function begins with gene expression profiling, and the transcriptome is currently the only '-ome' that can be reliably tackled in its entirety in freshly harvested primary cells. In order to gain novel insights into TEC biology, we therefore decided to analyse the whole transcriptome of cTECs, mTECs and skin epithelial cells. We elected to analyse gene expression using RNA-seq rather microarrays because RNA-seq has higher sensitivity and dynamic range coupled to lower technical variations. Results: Our deep sequencing approach provides a unique perspective into the transcriptome of TECs. Consistent with their ability to express ectopic genes, we found that mTECs expressed more genes than other cell populations. Out of a total of 15,069 genes expressed in TECs, 25% were differentially expressed by at least 5-fold in cTECs vs. mTECs. Genes expressed at higher levels in cTECs than mTECs regulate numerous cell functions including cell differentiation, cell movement and microtubule dynamics. Almost all positive regulators of the cell cycle were overexpressed in skin ECs relative to TECs. Conclusions: Our RNA-seq data provide novel insights into the transcriptional landscape of TECs, highlight substantial divergences in the transcriptome of TEC subsets and suggest that cell cycle progression is differentially regulated in TECS and skinECs. We believe that our work will therefore represent a valuable resource and will be of great interest to readers working in biological sciences, particularly in the areas of immunology and systems biology. The mRNA profiles of cTEC, mTEC (from 14 thymi of 7-days old C57BL/6 mice) and skinEC (from the trunk and dorsum of seven newborn mice) were generated by RNA-sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2000. .. newborn;  post natal day 7;  total RNA;  Cortical thymic epithelial cells;  Medullary thymic epithelial cells;  Skin epithelial cells;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Epidermis;  Thymus;

Hence, the identification of PPAR   coactivators should help reveal mechanisms controlling gene expression in adipose tissue development and physiology. We show that the non-coding RNA Steroid receptor RNA Activator, SRA, associates with PPAR   and coactivates PPAR  -dependent reporter gene expression. Overexpression of SRA in ST2 adipocyte precursor cells promotes their differentiation into adipocytes. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous SRA inhibits 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation.  Microarray analysis reveals hundreds of SRA-responsive genes in adipocytes, including genes in cell cycle, insulin and TNF   signaling pathways. Some functions of SRA may involve mechanisms other than coactivation of PPAR  . SRA increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. SRA promotes S-phase entry during mitotic clonal expansion, decreases expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibiters p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, and increases phosphorylation of Cdk1/Cdc2. SRA also inhibits the TNF  -induced phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. In conclusion, SRA enhances adipogenesis and adipocyte function through multiple pathways. Total RNA was isolated from fully differentiated (MDIT day 4) SRA overexpressing (pMSCV-SRA) and control (pMSCV empty vector) ST2 adipocytes, or fully differentiated (MDIT day 8) shSRA knockdown (pSuperior-shSRA) or shControl (pSuperior-shcontrol) 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

We used an in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening approach to identify novel genes that are essential for primary murine MLL-AF9 acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that Integrin Beta 3 (Itgb3) is selectively essential for murine leukemia cells in vivo, and for human leukemia cells in xenotransplantation studies. In leukemia cells, Itgb3 knockdown impaired homing, downregulated LSC transcriptional programs, and induced differentiation. In contrast, loss of Itgb3 in normal HSPCs did not affect engraftment, reconstitution, or differentiation in long term transplantation assays. We explored the signaling pathways downstream of Itgb3 using an additional in vivo shRNA screen and identified Syk as a critical mediator of Itgb3 activity in leukemia. Finally, we confirmed that Itgb3 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis and required for leukemogenesis using the Itgb3 knockout mouse model. Our results establish the significance of the Itgb3 signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in AML, and demonstrate the utility of in vivo RNA interference screens.

However, the mechanisms mediating these phenomena were not investigated or revealed in our previous study.  Methods and Findings: Here, we investigated the effect of WEPAK in mouse liver using transcriptome analysis and discovered that WEPAK induced the expression of genes categorized into the gene ontology (GO) term lipid metabolic process.  Furthermore, two regulators of fatty acid   -oxidation, AMPK and PPAR  , were induced in the liver and muscle of mice that had taken in WEPAK.  Conclusions: These results indicate that WEPAK increased the expression of genes related to fatty acid   -oxidation via activation of AMPK and PPAR  .

While 5mC and 5hmC are relatively abundant, 5fC and 5caC are at very low levels in the mammalian genome. Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and base excision repair (BER) pathways can actively remove 5fC/5caC to regenerate unmethylated cytosine, but it is unclear to what extent and at which part of the genome such active demethylation processes take place. Here, we have performed high-throughput sequencing analysis of 5mC/5hmC/5fC/5caC- enriched DNA using modification-specific antibodies and generated genome-wide distribution maps of these cytosine modifications in wild-type and Tdg-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We observe that the steady state 5fC and 5caC are preferentially detected at repetitive sequences in wild-type mouse ESCs. Depletion of TDG causes marked accumulation of 5fC and 5caC at a large number of distal gene regulatory elements and transcriptionally repressed/poised gene promoters, suggesting that Tet/TDG-dependent dynamic cycling of 5mC oxidation states may be involved in regulating the function of these regions. Thus, comprehensive mapping of 5mC oxidation and BER pathway activity in the mammalian genome provides a promising approach for better understanding of biological roles of DNA methylation and demethylation dynamics in development and diseases.

Here, we comprehensively analyze lncRNA expression for the adult mouse subventricular zone neural stem cell lineage. We utilize complementary genome-wide techniques including RNA-seq, RNA CaptureSeq, and ChIP-seq to associate specific lncRNAs with neural cell types, developmental processes, and human disease states.

We used mice lacking Runx1 specifically in megakaryocytes (MKs) to characterize the Runx1-mediated transcriptional program during advanced stages of MK differentiation. Gene expression and chromatin-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) of Runx1 and  p300  identified functional Runx1-bound MK enhancers. Runx1/p300 co-bound regions showed significant enrichment in genes important for MK and platelet homeostasis. Runx1-bound regions were highly enriched in RUNX and ETS motifs and to a lesser extent in GATA motif.

Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation can attenuate the binding of Polycomb protein components to chromatin and thus plays a role in determining their genomic targeting. However, whether this role of DNA methylation is important in the context of transcriptional regulation is unclear. By genome-wide mapping of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-signature histone mark, H3K27me3, in severely DNA hypomethylated mouse somatic cells, we show that hypomethylation leads to widespread H3K27me3 redistribution, in a manner that reflects the local DNA methylation status in wild-type cells. Unexpectedly, we observe striking loss of H3K27me3 and PRC2 from Polycomb-target gene promoters in DNA hypomethylated cells, including Hox gene clusters. Importantly, we show that many of these genes become ectopically expressed in DNA hypomethylated cells, consistent with loss of Polycomb-mediated repression. An intact DNA methylome is required for appropriate Polycomb-mediated gene repression by constraining PRC2 targeting. These observations identify a previously unappreciated role for DNA methylation in gene regulation and therefore influence our understanding of how this epigenetic mechanism contributes to normal development and disease. comparison of Dnmt1+/+ vs Dnmt1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts by strand-specific mRNA-seq ..

To explain these paradoxical observations, we explored the gene regulatory networks at play. Canonical Wnt signaling is intertwined with the pluripotency network comprising Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 in mouse ESCs. In defined media supporting the derivation and propagation of mouse ESCs, Tcf3 and   -catenin interact with Oct4; Tcf3 binds to Sox motif within Oct-Sox composite motifs that are also bound by Oct4-Sox2 complexes. Further, canonical Wnt signaling up-regulates the activity of the Pou5f1 distal enhancer via the Sox motif in mouse ESCs. When viewed in the context of published studies on Tcf3 and   -catenin mutants, our findings suggest that Tcf3 counters pluripotency by competition with Sox2 at these sites, and Tcf3 inhibition is blocked by   -catenin entry into this complex. Wnt pathway stimulation also triggers   -catenin association at regulatory elements with classic Lef/Tcf motifs associated with differentiation programs. The failure to activate these targets in the presence of a MEK/ERK inhibitor essential for mouse ESC culture suggests that MEK/ERK signaling and canonical Wnt signaling combine to promote mouse ESC differentiation.

In mammals, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is triggered by Xist RNA to equalize gene expression between the sexes. Here we delete Xist in the blood compartment of mice and demonstrate that mutant females develop a highly aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm and myelodysplastic syndrome (mixed MPN/MDS) with 100% penetrance. Significant disease components include primary myelofibrosis, leukemia, histiocytic sarcoma, and vasculitis. Xist-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) show aberrant maturation and age-dependent loss. Reconstitution experiments indicate that MPN/MDS and myelofibrosis are of hematopoietic rather than stromal origin. We propose that Xist loss results in X-reactivation and consequent genome-wide changes that lead to cancer, thereby causally linking the X-chromosome to cancer in mice.  Thus, Xist RNA is not only required to maintain XCI but also suppresses cancer in vivo. We carried out expression profiling in hematopoietic cells isolated from Xist-deficient female mice before disease (2 months old) and during myeloprolifeative neoplasm/myelodysplastic syndrome (MPN/MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)-like disease (6 and 12 months old) and compared profiles of purified bone marow HSCs (KLS+CD34-), splenic B-cells (B220+), myeloid cells (CD11b+), and erythroid cells (Ter119+) against those of corresponding cell types from age-matched wild-type female mice.

We found that MOF knockdown in mouse ES cells caused a greater drop in expression of X-linked genes compared to autosomal genes, as measured by expression array analyses. The strongest effect was observed on medium-expressed X-linked genes. We next examined components of the two known MOF protein complexes, MSL1 (male-specific lethal1) and NSL1 (nonspecific lethal1). Knockdown of MSL1 but not NSL1 in undifferentiated female ES cells PGK12.1 specifically caused a decrease in expression levels of X-linked genes. Cells co-transfected with both MOF and MSL1 siRNAs had similar expression changes to MSL1 knockdown alone, indicating that these components probably operate within the same complex but are not additive.

Here we performed differentiation assays, as well as genome-wide molecular and functional studies in BL-CFCs to gain insight into the function of the essential Ldb1 factor in early primitive hematopoietic development. We show that the previously reported lack of yolk sac hematopoiesis and vascular development in Ldb1-/- mouse result from a decreased number of hemangioblasts and a block in their ability to differentiate into erythroid and endothelial progenitor cells. Transcriptome analysis and correlation with the genome wide binding pattern of Ldb1 in hemangioblasts revealed a number of direct target genes and pathways misregulated in the absence of Ldb1. The regulation of essential developmental factors by Ldb1 defines it as an upstream transcriptional regulator of hematopoietic/endothelial development. We show the complex interplay that exists between transcription factors and signaling pathways during the very early stages of hematopoietic/endothelial development and the specific signalling occurring in hemangioblasts in contrast to more advanced hematopoietic developmental stages. Finally, by revealing novel genes and pathways, not previously associated with early development, our study provides novel candidate targets to manipulate the differentiation of hematopoietic and/or endothelial cells.

Gas chromatography and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance were used to measure quantitatively serum lipid profiles and whole genome microarray analysis was used to identify the responsible mechanisms in liver. There were no significant differences found in mean body weight, energy intake and hepatic lipid accumulation between the quercetin and control group.  In serum of quercetin-fed mice, TG levels were decreased with 15%, poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were increased with 14% and saturated fatty acids were decreased. Palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid were all decreased in quercetin-fed mice by 9-15%. Both palmitic acid and oleic acid can be oxidized by omega-oxidation. Indeed, gene expression profiling showed that quercetin increased hepatic lipid metabolism, especially omega-oxidation. At the gene level, this was reflected by the up regulation of cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 4a10, Cyp4a14, Cyp4a31 and Acyl-CoA thioesterase 3 (Acot3). Two relevant regulators, Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Por, rate limiting for cytochrome P450s) and the transcription factor Constitutive androstane receptor (Car; official symbol Nr1i3) were also up regulated in the quercetin-fed mice. We conclude that quercetin intake increased hepatic lipid omega-oxidation and lowered corresponding circulating lipid levels, a process that may involve Por and Car, and results in a potential beneficial CVD preventive effect. Liver samples were obtained from 36 C57BL/6J male adult mice. All mice started with a three week adaptation phase, in which they were fed a mild-high-fat diet. 12 mice were sacrificed immediately after the adaptation phase (t=0).

However, the mechanisms that control expression of these positive and negative master regulators of adipogenesis remain incompletely understood. By genome-wide histone methylation profiling in preadipocytes, we find that among gene loci encoding adipogenesis regulators, histone methyltransferase (HMT) G9a-mediated repressive epigenetic mark H3K9me2 is enriched on the entire PPAR   locus. H3K9me2 and G9a levels decrease during adipogenesis, which correlates inversely with induction of PPAR  . Removal of H3K9me2 by G9a deletion enhances chromatin opening and binding of adipogenic transcription factor C/EBP-beta to PPAR   promoter, which promotes PPAR   expression. Interestingly, G9a represses PPAR   expression in an HMT activity-dependent manner but facilitates Wnt10a expression independent of its enzymatic activity. Consistently, deletion of G9a or inhibiting G9a HMT activity promotes adipogenesis. Finally, deletion of G9a in mouse adipose tissues increases adipogenic gene expression and tissue weight. Thus, by inhibiting PPAR   expression and facilitating Wnt10a expression, G9a represses adipogenesis. Examination of 3 different histone modification changes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes ..

While inactivation of FMR1 causes Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation, inactivation of FXR1 in various animal models suggest a critical role for the RNA-binding protein FXR1P during myogenesis. Seven alternatively spliced FXR1 transcripts have been identified, three of them being muscle-specific. We previously reported a reduction of these isoforms in myoblasts from Fascio Scapulo Humeral Distrophy (FSHD) myopathic patients. However, so far, no mRNA target of FXR1P has been linked to the drastic muscular phenotypes caused by its absence and the exact molecular role of FXR1P in muscular development remains unknown. In the present study, gene expression profiling of C2C12 myoblasts reveals that transcripts involved in cell cycle and muscular development pathways are modulated by Fxr1-depletion. In addition, Fxr1-depletion translates physiologically into a premature cell cycle exit of myoblasts, accompanied by a robust up-regulation of the cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitor p21/Cdkn1a/Waf/Cip1 mRNA. Importantly, we also observe this P21 increase in FSHD human myoblasts depleted in FXR1P muscular isoforms. Our data further indicate that FXR1P muscle-specific isoforms are involved in the post-transcriptional control of p21 mRNA levels via direct interaction with a conserved G-quadruplex structure located in its 3    untranslated region. This study has crucial implications for the understanding of FXR1P role during myogenesis and the pathophysiology of FSHD. 2 independent experiments performed in a one color design, corresponding to 2 conditions: si-control and si-fxr1, for a total of 4 samples. .. 0.2;  C2C12 myoblastic cell line;  control;  siFxr1;  total RNA;  8;  9;  siControl exp#1;  siControl exp#2;  siFxr1 exp#1;  siFxr1 exp#2;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Here, we uncovered the existence of latent enhancers, defined as regions of the genome that in terminally differentiated cells are poorly accessible and lack the histone marks characteristic of enhancers, but readily acquire these features in response to extracellular cues. Stimulation of resting macrophages caused simultaneous binding of stimulus-activated TFs and lineage-determining TFs to these regions, enabling deposition of enhancer-specific features. Once unveiled, these enhancers did not return to a latent state even when stimulation ceased; instead, they persisted and mediated a faster and stronger response upon restimulation. We suggest that stimulus-specific expansion of the available cis-regulatory repertoire provides an epigenomic memory of the exposure to environmental agents.

Despite several studies on the function of this gene, the exact in vivo role of Lmx1a in mesodiencephalic dopamine (mdDA) neuronal specification is still not understood. To analyze the genes functioning downstream of Lmx1a, we performed expression microarray analysis of LMX1A overexpressing MN9D dopaminergic cells. Several interesting regulated genes were identified, based on their regulation in other, previously generated expression arrays, and their expression pattern in the developing mdDA neuronal field. Post analysis through in vivo expression analysis in Lmx1a mouse mutant (drJ/drJ) embryos demonstrated a clear decrease in expression of the genes Grb10 and Rgs4, in and adjacent to the rostral and dorsal mdDA neuronal field and within the Lmx1a expression domain. Interestingly, the DA marker Vmat2 was significantly up-regulated as a consequence of increased LMX1A dose, and subsequent analysis on Lmx1a mutant E14.5 and adult tissue revealed a significant decrease in Vmat2 expression in mdDA neurons. Taken together, microarray analysis of an LMX1A overexpression cell system resulted in the identification of novel downstream targets of Lmx1A in mdDA neurons: Grb10, Rgs4 and Vmat2.

While a subset of STS are characterized by simple karyotypes and recurrent chromosomal translocations, the mechanisms driving cytogenetically complex sarcomas are largely unknown. Clinical evidence led us to partially inactivate Pten and p53 in the smooth muscle lineage of mice, which developed high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (HGUPS), leiomyosarcomas (LMS) and carcinosarcomas (CS) that widely recapitulate the human disease, including the aberrant karyotype and metastatic behavior. Pten was found haploinsufficient whereas the wild-type allele of p53 invariably gained point mutations. Gene expression profile showed upregulated Notch signaling in Pten   /+p53   /+ tumors compared to Pten+/+p53   /+. Consistently, Pten silencing exacerbated the clonogenic and invasive potential of p53-deficient bone marrow-derived mouse mesenchymal stem cells and tumor cells, while activating the Notch pathway. Moreover, the increased oncogenic behavior of Pten   /+p53   /+ and shPten-transduced Pten+/+p53   /+ tumor cells was counteracted by treatment with a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI), suggesting that the aggressiveness of those tumors can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced Notch signaling. This study demonstrates a cooperative role for Pten and p53 suppression in complex karyotype sarcomas while establishing Notch as an important functional player in the crosstalk of these pathways during tumor progression.

We hypothesized that the keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an important mediator of lung organogenesis and primary ATII cell maturation and proliferation, together with dexamethasone, 8-bromoadenosine-cAMP, and isobutylmethylxanthine (DCI), which induce maturation of primary fetal ATII cells, also support the alveolar differentiation of murine ESCs. Here we demonstrate that the above stimuli synergistically potentiate the alveolar differentiation of ESCs as indicated by increased expression of the surfactant proteins (SP-) C and SP-B. This effect is most profound if KGF is supplied not only in the late stage, but at least also during the intermediate stage of differentiation. Our results indicate that KGF most likely does not enhance the generation of (mes)endodermal or NK2 homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1) expressing progenitor cells but rather, supported by DCI, accelerates further differentiation/maturation of respiratory progeny in the intermediate phase and maturation/proliferation of emerging ATII cells in the late stage of differentiation. Ultrastructural analyses confirmed the presence of ATII-like cells with intracellular composite and lamellar bodies. Finally, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from transgenic mice with ATII cell-specific lacZ reporter expression. Again, KGF and DCI synergistically increased SP-C and SP-B expression in iPSC cultures, and lacZ expressing ATII-like cells developed. In conclusion, ATII cell-specific reporter expression enabled the first reliable proof for the generation of murine iPSC-derived ATII cells. In addition, we have shown KGF and DCI to synergistically support the generation of ATII-like cells from ESCs and iPSCs. Combined application of these factors will facilitate more efficient generation of stem cell-derived ATII cells for future basic research and potential therapeutic application. 10 samples in total.mESCs at d8 of differentiation (Control)mESCs at d8 of differentiation with KGF treatmentmESCs at d17 of differentiation (Control)mESCs at d17 of differentiation with KGF treatmentmESCs at d17 of differentiation with DCI treatmentmESCs at d17 of differentiation with KGF and DCI treatmentmESCs at d24 of differentiation (Control)mESCs at d24 of differentiation with KGF treatmentmESCs at d24 of differentiation with DCI treatmentmESCs at d24 of differentiation with KGF and DCI treatment .. mESCs;  total RNA;  mESCs at d17 of differentiation (Control);  mESCs at d17 of differentiation with DCI treatment;  mESCs at d17 of differentiation with KGF and DCI treatment;  mESCs at d17 of differentiation with KGF treatment;  mESCs at d24 of differentiation (Control);  mESCs at d24 of differentiation with DCI treatment;  mESCs at d24 of differentiation with KGF and DCI treatment;  mESCs at d24 of differentiation with KGF treatment;  mESCs at d8 of differentiation (Control);  mESCs at d8 of differentiation with KGF treatment;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  d17 of differentiation (Control);  d17 of differentiation with DCI treatment;  d17 of differentiation with KGF and DCI treatment;  d17 of differentiation with KGF treatment;  d24 of differentiation (Control);  d24 of differentiation with DCI treatment;  d24 of differentiation with KGF and DCI treatment;  d24 of differentiation with KGF treatment;  d8 of differentiation (Control);  d8 of differentiation with KGF treatment;

Here we show that mutation of ZNF335 causes severe human microcephaly ("small brain"), small somatic size, and neonatal death. Germline Znf335 null mutations are embryonically lethal in mice, whereas RNA-interference studies and postmortem human studies show that Znf335 is essential for neural progenitor self-renewal, neurogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. Znf335 is a component of a vertebrate-specific, trithorax H3K4 methylation complex, while global ChIP-seq and mRNA expression studies show that Znf335 is a previously unsuspected, direct regulator of REST/NRSF, a master regulator of neural gene expression and neural cell fate, as well as other essential neural-specific genes.

Here we use hematopoietic cells from the Booreana mouse strain, which carries a mutation in Myb that prevents interaction with CBP/p300, to examine the requirement for this interaction in myeloid transformation and leukemogenesis. Using this strain and a strain (plt6) carrying a    complementary    mutation in p300, we show that the Myb-p300 interaction is essential for in vitro transformation by the myeloid leukemia oncogenes AML1-ETO, AML1-ETO9a, MLL-ENL, and MLL-AF9. We further show that unlike cells from wild-type (WT) mice, Booreana cells fail to induce leukemia upon transplantation into irradiated recipients following transduction with an AML1-ETO9a retrovirus. These data highlight disruption of the Myb-p300 interaction as a potential therapeutic strategy for AML and suggest that such a strategy would have a useable therapeutic index since Booreana mice, unlike Myb null mice, are viable. Finally we have begun to explore the molecular basis of the these observations by gene expression profiling; this highlighted several genes previously implicated in myeloid leukemogenesis as being differentially expressed between WT and Booreana cells transduced with AML1-ETO9a. Total RNA was obtained from FACS sorted GFP+;c-Kit+ primary bone marrow cells from WT and Booreana mouse strains which had been cultured for 48 hours post-transduction with Control or AML1-ETO9a retroviruses. RNA was extracted from each of 4 samples per group and used to probe Illumina mouse Beadchips array. ..

Thorough annotation of gene 3' ends revealed over 5,000 previously overlooked pAs (~8% of total) flanked by A-rich sequences, underscoring the necessity of using an accurate tool for pA mapping. About 79% of mRNA genes and 66% of long noncoding RNA genes undergo APA, but these two gene types have distinct usage patterns for pAs in introns and upstream exons.

The biological signals that initiate mitochondrial restructuring and the cellular processes that drive this adaptive response are largely obscure. To better define these systems, we performed matched quantitative genomic and proteomic analyses of mouse muscle cells as they performed mitochondrial biogenesis. We find that proteins involved in cellular iron homeostasis are highly coordinated with this process, and that depletion of cellular iron results in a rapid, dose-dependent decrease of select mitochondrial protein levels and oxidative capacity. We further show that this process is universal across a broad range of cell types and fully reversed when iron is reintroduced. Collectively, our work reveals that cellular iron is a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and provides quantitative datasets that can be leveraged to explore post-transcriptional and post-translational processes that are essential for mitochondrial adaptation.

Foxp3 is a transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of Treg development and function. A serendipitous observation led to the realization that a well-characterized Foxp3gfp reporter mouse, which expresses an N-terminal GFP-Foxp3 fusion protein, is a hypomorph that causes profoundly accelerated autoimmune diabetes on a NOD background. Although natural Treg development and in vitro function is not significantly altered in Foxp3gfp NOD and C57BL/6 mice, Treg fitness function in inflammatory environments is perturbed and TGF  -induced Treg development reduced. Foxp3gfpis unable to interact with the histone acetyltransferase Tip60, the histone deacetylase HDAC7, and the Ikaros family zinc finger 4, Eos, which leads to reduced Foxp3 acetylation and enhanced K48-linked polyubiquitylation.

Selenoproteins are essential for skin function, as targeted abolition of selenoproteins in epidermal tissue results in newborn mice manifesting gross abnormalities of skin and hair, accompanied by retarded growth and premature death. To investigate whether lack of a single selenoprotein could induce similar phenotypic effect in mice, we generated keratinocyte-specific knockout mice lacking glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), an essential selenoprotein in skin, to examine phenotypic changes resulting from the lack of GPx4 in skin. Ablation of GPx4 results in focal alopecia and disturbed hair follicle morphogenesis, with GPx4 being essential during early stages of hair follicle morphogenesis as well as for keratinocyte adhesion and proliferation in culture. We have generated mice with selective removal of the GPx4 gene in keratinocytes under the control of Keratin-14-cre (K14-cre) promoter.

In turn this raises the possibility that PTEN elevation might be an attractive option for cancer prevention and therapy. We have generated several transgenic mouse lines with variably elevated PTEN expression levels, taking advantage of BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome)-mediated transgenesis. Super-PTEN mutants are viable and show reduced body size due to decreased cell number, with no effect on cell size. Unexpectedly, PTEN elevation at the organism level results in healthy metabolism characterized by increased energy expenditure and reduced body fat accumulation. Cells derived from these mice show reduced glucose and glutamine uptake, increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and are resistant to oncogenic transformation. Mechanistically we find that PTEN elevation orchestrates this metabolic switch by regulating PI3K-dependent and independent pathways, and negatively impacts two of the most pronounced metabolic features of tumor cells: glutaminolysis and the Warburg effect. In order to elucidate the pathophysiological impact of PTEN elevation, we generated transgenic mice carrying additional copies of this critical tumor suppressor gene (referred to as Super-PTEN mice). In order to maintain the regulation properties of the endogenous Pten gene, we made use of large genomic fragments containing the entire Pten locus carried by BACs (Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes). We next generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and confirmed successful overexpression of PTEN by the BAC transgenic system. Primary cells derived from Super-PTEN mice represent a powerful tool to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying dose-dependent PTEN actions. We therefore performed microarray analysis in primary cells (MEFs) derived from day 13.5 embryos obtained by crossing Super-PTEN mice with C57BL6 mice.

Salmon STAC3 mRNA was highly correlated with myogenin and myoD1a expression during differentiation of a salmon primary myogenic culture and was regulated by amino acid availability. In zebrafish embryos, STAC3 was initially expressed in myotomal adaxial cells and in fast muscle fibres post-segmentation.  Morpholino knockdown resulted in defects in myofibrillar protein assembly, particularly in slow muscle fibres, and decreased levels of the hedgehog receptor patched.  The function of STAC3 was further characterized in vitro using the mammalian C2C12 myogenic cell line.  STAC3 mRNA expression increased during the differentiation of the C2C12 myogenic cell line.  Knockdown of STAC3 by RNAi inhibited myotube formation, and microarray analysis revealed that transcripts involved in cell cycle, focal adhesion, cytoskeleton and the pro-myogenic factors IGFBP-5 and IGF2 were down regulated.  RNAi-treated cells had suppressed AKT signalling and exogenous IGF2 was unable to rescue the phenotype, however, IGF/AKT signalling was not blocked.  Overexpression of STAC3, which results in increased levels of IGFBP-5 mRNA, did not lead to increased differentiation.  In synchronized cells, STAC3 mRNA was most abundant during the G1 phase of the cell cycle.  RNAi-treated cells were smaller, had higher proliferation rates and decreased proportion of cells in G1 phase when compared to controls, suggesting a role in the G1 phase checkpoint. These results identify STAC3 as a new gene required for myogenic differentiation and myofibrillar protein assembly in vertebrates.  We identified STAC3 as being essential for myogenic differentiation. The goal of the microarray analysis was to identify genes that were up- or down-regulated in C2C12 cells when STAC3 expression was inhibited by interfering RNA (RNAi). The microarray compares the C2C12 mouse myogenic cell line between control samples to samples treated with an interfering RNA directed at STAC3.  The mouse C2C12 cell line was used at two time points: day 0, which was 24 hours after adding the RNAi, with cells growing in growth media (non-differentiating), and day 1, which was 48 hours after the interfering RNAi was added, and 24 hours after switching to differentiation media. RNAi-treated cells were transfected with an RNAi directed against STAC3, and control cells were transfected with a high-GC content control RNAi. Total RNA was extracted from control and RNAi-treated samples at two time points, at day 0 (24 h after treating with RNAi, while samples were still in growth media), and at day 1 (cells grown in differentiation media for 24h, 48 h after RNAi treatment). At each time point, STAC3 RNAi-treated cells were compared to controls. For the array comparison, at day 0, triplicate biological samples + one technical replicate were used for the controls, and four biological samples were used for the RNAi-treated cells.  At day 1, four biological samples and one technical replicate were used for controls and RNAi-treated cells. Technical replicate identifiers are appended by _r. ..

Here we introduce a double fluorescent reporter mouse model combined   with an optimized bead perfusion protocol and efficient single cell   dissociation yielding more than 500,000 podocytes per mouse allowing for   global, unbiased downstream applications.   Combining mRNA  transcriptional profiling revealed programs of highly   specific gene regulation tightly controlling cytoskeleton,   cell differentiation, endosomal transport and peroxisome function in podocytes.   Strikingly, the analyses further predict that these podocyte-specific gene   regulatory networks are accompanied by alternative splicing of respective genes.   In summary, the presented    omics    approach will facilitate the discovery   and integration of novel gene, protein and organelle regulatory   networks that deepen our systematic understanding of podocyte biology. To compare gene expression of glomerulus podocytes versus non-podocytes  5 replicates of 4 pooled mice were used. Data were normalized by robust multi-chip analysis. Exon expression values were summarised to the core meta probesets, as defined by Affymetrix, using the oligo library from R. .. non-podocyte cell from kidney glomerulus;  podocyte cell from kidney glomerulus;  mixed C57Bl6, Sv129/J and ICR;  total RNA;  Mouse Non Podocyte;  Mouse Podocyte;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Mouse kidneys were dissected and transfered into dishes with 37?C  Hank?s buffered salt solution. Each kidney was perfused through the renal artery with 4 ml 37?C warm bead solution and 1 ml bead solution plus enzymatic digestion buffer.  Kidneys were minced and after addition of 3 ml digestion buffer incubated at 37?C for 15 min on a rotator. After incubation all steps were performed at 4 ?C or on ice. The digested kidneys were pressed twice through a 100 ?m cellstrainer and the flow through washed with HBSS. After spinning down, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 2 ml HBSS. These tubes were inserted into a magnetic particle concentrator and the separated gloms were washed twice. Glomerula were resuspended in 2 ml digestion buffer and incubated for 40 min at 37?C on a thermomixer shaking at 1400/min. During the incubation period the following was done: glomerula were sheered with a 27G needle at 15 min, they were mixed by pipetting twice at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 min using a  glass pipette. Podocytes were loosened at 10, 20, 30 min by vortexing once. After 40 min the solution was vortexed three times and the digestion result controlled by fluorescence microscopy. Eppendorfs were put on a magnetic particle concentrator again to get rid of beads and glomerular structures void of podocytes. The supernatant was pooled and the magnetic particles discarded. The cell suspension (2 ml) was sieved through a 40 ?m pore size filter on top of a 50 ml Falcon tube, rinsed with 10 ml of HBSS. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4?C, re-suspended in 0,5 ml of HBSS supplemented with 0.1% BSA plus DAPI (1?g/ml). To separate GFP-expressing (GFP+) and GFP-negative (GFP-) cells, glomerular cells were sorted with a Mo-Flo cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) with a Laser excitation at 488nm (Power 200 mW) and a sheath pressure of 60 PSI. Only viable (DAPI negative) cells were sorted (laser excitation 380nm, power 80 mW).;

Recently, some were shown to transdifferentiate noncardiac mesoderm cells and cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. However, the individual roles of each transcription factors in activating cardiac gene program have not been elucidated. We examined cardiac-specific and genome-wide gene expression in fibroblasts induced with cardiac transcription factors Nkx2.5 (N), Tbx5 (T), Gata4 (G), Myocardin (M) alone or different combinations.   Methodology/Principal Findings: We applied different combinations of human Nkx2.5 (N), Tbx5 (T), Gata4 (G) and Myocardin (M) lentiviruses into 10T1/2 fibroblasts. Immunostaining and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that N, T, G or M alone did not induce expression of cardiac marker genes   -myosin heavy chain (  MHC) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Only T+M and T+G+M combinations induced   MHC and cTnT expression. Microarray-based gene ontology analysis revealed that T alone inhibited most genes involved in cardiac-related processes and activated genes involved in Wnt receptor signaling pathway and in aberrant processes. M alone inhibited genes involved in Wnt receptor signaling pathway and activated genes involved in cardiac-related processes and in aberrant processes. G alone inhibited genes involved in ectoderm development. T+G+M combination was the most effective activator of genes associated with cardiac-related processes including muscle cell differentiation, sarcomere, striated muscle contraction, regulation of heart contraction, and glucose metabolism and fatty acid oxidation (two significant forms of cardiomyocyte energy metabolism). And unlike T, M, G alone or T+M, T+G+M did not activate genes associated with aberrant processes.  Conclusions: Tbx5, Gata4 and Myocardin play different roles in activating cardiac gene program and in avoiding aberrant gene program activation. The combination of T+G+M activated cardiac gene program and avoided aberrant gene program activation. Two weeks after doxycline induction, total RNA was isolated from 10T1/2-tTA cells infected with different combinations of Tbx5, Gata4, and Myocardin lentiviruses.

While enhancers are recognized as key elements that regulate selective gene expression, the interplay between signaling pathways and actively used enhancer elements is not clear. Here, we use CD4+ T cells as a model of differentiation, mapping the acquisition of cell-type-specific enhancer elements in T-helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells. Our data establish that STAT proteins have a major impact on the acquisition of lineage-specific enhancers and the suppression of enhancers associated with alternative cell fates. Transcriptome analysis further supports a functional role for enhancers regulated by STATs. Importantly, expression of lineage-defining master regulators in STAT-deficient cells fails to fully recover the chromatin signature of STAT-dependent enhancers. Thus, these findings point to a critical role of STATs as environmental sensors in dynamically molding the specialized enhancer architecture of differentiating cells. Active enhancer elements were defined as p300-high/H3K4me1-high. Using ChIP-seq, we mapped active enhancer landscapes of two CD4+ T helper cells, Th1 and Th2. To investigate the effect of STAT proteins on this landscape, we profiled active enhancers in the absence of STATs. Overall, STATs deficiency had a major impact on recruitment of p300. In addition, ectopic expression of master regulators T-bet and GATA3 in STAT-deficient cells failed to recover most active enhancers. .. ab8895, AbCam;  sc-585, Santa Cruz Biotechnology;  sc-592, Santa Cruz Biotechnology;  Th0;  in vitro polarized T helper1 cells for 5 days with T-bet overexpression;  in vitro polarized T helper1 cells for 5 days with T-bet overexpression.;  in vitro polarized T helper1 cells for 5 days with T-bet vector.;  in vitro polarized T helper1 cells for 5 days with control vector;  in vitro polarized T helper1 cells for 5 days with control vector.;  in vitro polarized T helper1 cells for 7 days;  in vitro polarized T helper2 cells for 5 days with Gata3 overexpression;  in vitro polarized T helper2 cells for 5 days with control vector.;  in vitro polarized T helper2 cells for 7 days;  anti-K4me1;  anti-STAT1;  anti-p300;  STAT1<tm1> (STAT1KO);  STAT4<tm1> (STAT4KO);  Stat6<tm1> (Stat6KO);  Tbet<tm1> (TbetKO);  wild type;  genomic DNA;  total RNA;  FACS sorted naive CD4+T cells cultured in vitro for 7 days under Th1 condition and restimulated with plate-bound CD3/28 +IL12 for 2 hrs;  FACS sorted naive CD4+T cells cultured in vitro for 7 days under Th1 condition and restimulated with plate-bound CD3/28 +IL12 for 2 hrs.;  FACS sorted naive CD4+T cells cultured in vitro for 7 days under Th2 condition and restimulated with plate-bound CD3/28 +IL4 for 2 hrs;  FACS sorted naive CD4+T cells with plate-bound CD3/28;  Gata3 overexpression vector was made in Th2 cells.;  primary CD4+ T cells from spleen and lymph nodes;  C57BL/6J;  10090;  Mus musculus;  To over-express T-bet, we first made pMY-IRES-hNGFR vector as a control vector by replacing EGFP of pMYs-IRES-GFP vector (Cell Biolabs) with hNGFR lacking intracellular domain.

Most target prediction and discovery relies on perfect complementarity of the miRNA seed to the 3    untranslated region (UTR).  However, it is unclear to what extent miRNAs target sites without seed matches.  Here, we performed a transcriptome-wide identification of the endogenous targets of a single miRNA   miR-155   in a genetically controlled manner.  We found that approximately forty percent of miR-155-dependent Argonaute binding occurs at sites without perfect seed matches.  The majority of these non-canonical sites feature extensive complementarity to the miRNA seed with one mismatch.  These non-canonical sites confer regulation of gene expression albeit less potently than canonical sites.  Thus, non-canonical miRNA binding sites are widespread, often contain seed-like motifs, and can regulate gene expression, generating a continuum of targeting and regulation. Argonaute (AGO) HITS-CLIP Libraries generated from wild type and miR-155 knockout activated T cells. AGO HITS-CLIP libraries were generated from activated wild type and miR-155 knockout T cells with two different 3' linkers.

In response to injury and infection, MMP7 expression is quickly and markedly upregulated and functions to regulate wound repair and various mucosal immune processes. We evaluated the global transcriptional response of airway epithelial cells from wild type and Mmp7-null mice cultured at an air-liquid interface. A common injury response was seen in both genotypes with up-regulation of genes associated with proliferation and migration. Analysis of differentially expressed genes between genotypes after injury revealed enrichment of functional categories associated with inflammation, cilia and differentiation. Because these analyses suggested MMP7 regulated ciliogenesis, we evaluated the recovery of the airway epithelium in wild type and Mmp7-null mice in vivo after naphthalene injury.

Increased PIM1 expression has been correlated with cancer metastasis by facilitating migration and anti-adhesion. Endothelial cells play a pivotal role in these processes by contributing a barrier to the blood stream. Here, we investigated whether PIM1 regulates mouse aortic endothelial cell (MAEC) monolayer integrity. Methods: Pim1-/-MAEC were isolated from Pim1 knockout mice and used in trypsinization-, wound closure assays, electrical cell-substrate sensing, immunostaining, cDNA transfection and as RNA source for microarray analysis. Results: Pim1-/-MAEC displayed decreased migration, slowed cell detachment and increased electrical resistance across the endothelial monolayer. Reintroduction of Pim1- cDNA into Pim1-/-MAEC significantly restored wildtype adhesive characteristics. Pim1-/--MAEC displayed enhanced focal adhesion and adherens junction structures containing vinculin and   -catenin, respectively. Junctional molecules such as Cadherin 13 and matrix components such as Collagen 6a3 were highly upregulated in Pim1-/- cells. Intriguingly, extracellular matrix deposited by Pim1-/- cells alone was sufficient to induce the hyperadhesive phenotype in wildtype endothelial cells. Conclusion: Loss of Pim1 induces a strong adhesive phenotype by enhancing endothelial cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion by the deposition of a specific extracellular matrix.

Esrrb functions in somatic cells via LBD/AF-2-dependent coactivator recruitment to target genes. Here we show that in ES cells coactivator recruitment is similarly required and identify Ncoa3 as the Esrrb coactivator needed for activation of its target genes. Ncoa3 is essential for self-renewal and the induction of pluripotency in reprogramming, and genome-wide analysis of Ncoa3 binding reveals extensive overlap with Esrrb and pluripotency factors along with marks of active genes. Mechanistically, we show Ncoa3 is specifically required to bridge RNApol2 to Esrrb. We thus identify a new member of the ES pluripotency network and describe Esrrb and Ncoa3 as key factors linking core pluripotency factors to the general transcription machinery.

Process conditions are closely monitored as they can influence product characteristics. Culture of mammalian cells at different scales is a vital part of biomanufacturing. Currently, scale up of bioreactors is largely done based on engineering parameters such as oxygen transfer and mixing characteristics. There is a lack of genomic translational studies in mammalian cell culture scale-up that can help delineate measurable cellular attributes for improved process understanding. These could be used for quantifying physiological response of cells due to changes in bioreactor environment. In this study, we identified 18 process-sensitive sentinel genes using microarray statistical analysis, which we further verified by qRT-PCR. These were differentially expressed transcripts between a typical 5 liter bench-scale bubble-aerated and impeller-agitated bioreactor and novel 35 mL high-throughput minibioreactors. Using expression changes and biochemical-pathway guidance of these sentinel genes, we were able to tune engineering parameters such that the improved scale-down resulted in both process parameter and sentinel gene profile convergence between the two systems, further solidifying the functionality evidence of these sentinel genes. This study serves as a starting point for developing qRT-PCR assays as comparability metrics that could be performed near-at-line during the cell culture process itself leading to enhanced process control. Additional broad applications of sentinel genes could be to validate different manufacturing facilities for the same product, and allow better process definition by fingerprinting the manufacturing process for more rapid biogenerics and vaccine approvals. We ran consecutive bioreactor (5L and HTCB) runs, each with an independent vial thaw, to achieve multiple biological replicates per time-point. Bioreactors were sampled approximately every 12 hours for RNA extraction. For the 5L bioreactors, microarray samples were run for day 1 (n=2), day 2 (n=2), day 3 (n=3), and day 3.5 (n=3).

Scurfy (Sf) mice bear a mutation in the forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) transcription factor, lack regulatory T-cells (Treg), develop multi-organ inflammation, and die prematurely. The major target organs affected are skin, lungs, and liver. Sf mice lacking the Il2 gene (Sf.Il2-/-), despite devoid of Treg, did not develop skin and lung inflammation, but the inflammation in liver, pancreas, submandibular gland and colon remained. Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed hundreds of genes were differentially regulated among Sf, Sf.Il2-/-, and B6 CD4+ T-cells but the most changes were those encoding receptors for trafficking/chemotaxis/retention and lymphokines. Our study suggests that IL-2 controls the skin and lung inflammation in Sf mice in an apparent "organ-specific" manner through two novel mechanisms: by regulating the expression of genes encoding receptors for T-cell trafficking/chemotaxis/retention and by regulating Th2 cell expansion and lymphokine production. Thus, IL-2 is a master regulator for multi-organ inflammation and an underlying etiological factor for various diseases associated with skin and lung inflammation.

The detailed mechanisms in these diseases are still largely unknown, but mice models have been useful to study these mechanisms and explore the detailed effects of potential compounds. Such compounds usually have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These properties are found in anthocyanins and a major source of dietary anthocyanins in Nordic diet is bilberries (European wild blueberries, Vaccinium myrtillus). In this explorative study we show results with differentially expressed genes in retina using a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model.  Our findings displayed differential regulation of genes in pathways for apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress, especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and glutathione metabolism. Mice fed with HFD had increased retinal gene expression of several crystallins, which was reduced in the retina of mice fed with bilberries.  Bilberries seem to reduce the expression of genes in MAPK and to increase the expression of genes in glutathione metabolism pathway. All together despite minor effects in the mouse phenotype, a diet rich in bilberries may prevent the retinal gene expression changes in the early stages of obesity. Mice were fed ad libitum with normal control diet (NCD, 10% kcal fat), high-fat diet (HFD, 45% kcal fat), 5% (w/w) freeze-dried biberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) in NCD (NCD+BB) or HFD (HFD+BB) for 12 weeks. Diets were prepared in Research Diets Inc. Feed consumption and weight gain were measured during the feeding trial, and blood pressure and serum markers of obesity at the end.Retinas were collected and RNA extracted from all 24 mice samples, and pooled retinas from 4 mice per group were hybridized with standard Illumina protocols. The expression in retinas was analyzed using R, Pathvisio and DAVID to screen for differences between high-fat and berry induced changes to control diets and further bilberry induced changes to HFD up- or downregulated transcripts.diet: NCD, HFD, NCD+BB, HFD+BB .. high-fat diet (45%);  normal (10%);  18 weeks;  5% bilberries (w/w);  control;  Custom made using D12450B in Research Diets Inc.;  Custom made using D12451 in Research Diets Inc.;  D12450B, Research Diets Inc.;  D12451, Research Diets Inc.;  12 weeks;  male;  total RNA;  a3;a17;a18;a43;  b2;b32;b42;b52;  c1;c5;c21;c31;  d4;d8;d34;d44;  Mouse retina;  C57BL/6J;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Mice were fed ad libitum with different diets and fasted 1-2 hours prior to sacrifice and collection of both retina per mice for total RNA extraction.;

The hampered metabolic adaptability triggers a further damage of insulin signaling. Since skeletal muscle is the main site of glucose uptake, effectiveness of T2D treatment depends in large on the improvement of insulin sensitivity and metabolic adaptability of the muscle. We have shown previously in mice fed an obesogenic high-fat diet that a combination treatment using n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) and thiazolidinedione (TZD) anti-diabetic drugs preserved metabolic health and synergistically improved muscle insulin sensitivity. We investigated here whether TZD rosiglitazone could elicit the additive beneficial effects on metabolic flexibility when combined with n-3 LC-PUFA. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were fed an obesogenic corn oil-based high-fat diet (cHF) for 8 weeks, or randomly assigned to various dietary treatments: (i) cHF+F, cHF with n-3 LC-PUFA concentrate replacing 15% of dietary lipids; (ii) cHF+ROSI, cHF with 10 mg rosiglitazone/kg diet; and (iii) cHF+F+ROSI, or chow-fed. Indirect calorimetry demonstrated superior preservation of metabolic flexibility to carbohydrates in response to the combination treatment. Metabolomic and gene expression analyses in the muscle suggested distinct and complementary effects of the single treatments, with rosiglitazone augmenting insulin sensitivity by the modulation of branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and n-3 LC PUFA supporting complete oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. These beneficial metabolic effects were associated with the activation of the switch between glycolytic and oxidative muscle fibers, especially in the cHF+F+ROSI mice. Our results further support the idea that the combination treatment using n-3 LC-PUFA and TZDs could improve the efficacy of the treatment of obese and diabetic patients. Male C57BL/6N mice had free access to water and Chow. Three-month-old mice were randomly assigned (8 animals per group) to cHF+ROSI diet (lipid content ~35% wt/wt) supplemented with  10 mg rosiglitazone/kg diet, or cHF+F+ROSI in which n-3 LC-PUFA concentrate (46% DHA, 14% EPA, wt/wt, as triglycerides; product EPAX 1050 TG) replaced 15% wt/wt of dietary lipids. The treatment lasted for 8 weeks, whereafter  the animals were first fasted for 10 hours during the light phase of the day (between 8.00hr and 18.00hr), than re-fed Chow (starting at 18.00hr), and killed the following day by cervical dislocation under pentobarbital anesthesia (between 9.00hr and 11.00hr); the so-called 'diet-switch protocol'.

The resulting AML1-ETO fusion proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of AML. To identify novel molecular and therapeutic targets, we performed combined gene expression and promoter occupancy profiling using a primary leukemia initiating cell-enriched population induced by AML1-ETO9a (AE9a). CD45, a negative regulator of cytokine/growth factor receptor and JAK/STAT signaling, is greatly downregulated; furthermore JAK1 and JAK2 are upregulated in these leukemia cells. Consequently, JAK/STAT signaling is enhanced in the AE9a leukemia cells. Importantly, AE9a leukemia cells are highly susceptible to perturbation of JAK/STAT signaling, and a JAK2-selective inhibitor, TG101209, effectively targets these leukemia cells in vivo, suggesting the potential efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in treating t(8;21) AML.

It has also been misused as a    cognitive enhancer    and as an alternative to other psychostimulants. Here, we investigate whether chronic or acute administration of methylphenidate in mice at either 1mg/kg or 10mg/kg dosing, affects cell number and gene expression in the basal ganglion.  Methodology/Principal findings: Through the use of stereological counting methods, we observed a significant reduction (~20%) in dopamine neuron numbers in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) following chronic administration of 10mg/kg MPH. This dosage of MPH also induced a significant increase in the number of morphologically-activated SNpc microglia. Additionally, exposure to either 1mg/kg or 10 mg/kg MPH increased the sensitivity of SNpc dopamine neurons to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced oxidative stress. Unbiased gene screening employing Affymetrix GeneChip   HT MG-430 PM revealed changes in 115 and 54 genes in the substantia nigra (SN) of mice exposed to 1mg/kg and 10mg/kg MPH doses, respectively. Decreases in the mRNA levels of gdnf, dat1, vmat2 and th in the substantia nigra (SN) was observed with both acute and chronic dosing of 10mg/kg MPH. We also found an increase in mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory genes il-6 and tnf-   in the striatum; although these were seen only at an acute dose of 10mg/kg and not following chronic dosing.  Conclusion: Collectively our results suggest that chronic MPH usage in mice, especially at prolonged higher doses, has long-term neurodegenerative consequences.  drug treatment: 3 control, 3 low dose treatment, 3 high dose treatment .. total RNA;  mRNA of substantia nigra from 10mg/kg methylphenidate-treated mouse;  mRNA of substantia nigra from 1mg/kg methylphenidate-treated mouse;  mRNA of substantia nigra from saline-treated mouse;  Swiss Webster;  10090;  Mus musculus;  substantia nigra;  10mg/kg MPH;  1mg/kg MPH;  Saline;

Mammary tumors were detected in WAP-Cre:Ptenf/f females with a latency of 15.2 months. By 18 months, nearly all mice had succumbed to cancer. MMTV-Cre:Ptenf/f mice developed mammary tumors after a longer latency of 26.4 months and reduced penetrance (70%) compared to WAP-Cre:Ptenf/f mice. Tumors from both models were heterogeneous, consisting primarily of differentiated adenocarcinoma (adenomyoepithelioma; ~70%) and adenosquamous carcinoma (20-25%). In addition, a small fraction of tumors was classified as acinar and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (4-7%) and adenosarcoma (3-4%). To test the consequences of combined Pten and p53 gene mutation on breast cancer, we deleted both genes via MMTV-Cre or WAP-Cre. Kaplan-Meier tumor free survival curves revealed that WAP-Cre:Ptenf/f:p53f/f and MMTV-Cre:Ptenf/f:p53f/f females developed tumors with reduced latency of 11.3 and 9.8 months, compared with 15.2, 26.4, and 16.9 months for single-mutant WAP-Cre:Ptenf/f, MMTV-Cre:Ptenf/f or MMTV-Cre:p53f/f mice, respectively. In contrast to the heterogeneity of Pten  tumors and small percentage of adenosarcomas in these mice, ~70% of Pten:p53 lesions were histologically classified as adeno-sacrcomatoid-like or mesenchymal-like breast cancer, with the rest exhibiting mixed mesenchymal plus adenocarcinomas and differentiated adenocarcinomas.

Meis2, another member of the same family, shares 82% protein identities with Meis1. Our present study suggested Meis2 exerts two distinguishable effects in differentiating ES cells.  First, it increases the numbers of hematopoietic progenitors and extends their persistence in culture. Second, Meis2 skews hematopoietic differentiation by suppressing erythroid while enhancing megakaryocytic progenitor differentiation. To identify the underlying transcriptional bases of these actions, we carried out microarray analysis to compare the various populations of cells developing in ES differentiation cultures in the presence and absence of Meis2 induction.

This intricate and often prolonged process is guided by elaborate genetic mechanisms that regulate each developmental event.  Evidence from numerous systems suggests that each cell type, once specified, is endowed with a genetic program that directs its subsequent development.  This cell intrinsic program unfolds in respond to, and is regulated by, extrinsic signals, including cell-cell and synaptic interactions. To a large extent, the execution of this genetic program is achieved by the expression of specific sets of genes that support distinct developmental processes.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the developmental progression of gene expression in synaptic partners of neurons may provide a basis for exploring the genetic mechanisms regulating circuit assembly. Here we examined the developmental gene expression profiles in well defined cell types in a stereotyped microcircuit of the cerebellar cortex. Manually sorted pure populations of Purkinje cells and Stellate/Basket cells, 3 biological replicates, from Gad67-GFP bac-transgenic (G42) mice were profiled during postnatal developmental stages P3, P7, P14, P21, P28, P35 and P56 using Affymetrix MOE430.2 expression array ..

Piwi proteins, a subclade of the Argonaute family, are expressed mainly in the germline and bind piRNAs, a novel and diverse class of small RNAs whose biogenesis and putative functions are still largely elusive. We employed High Throughput Sequencing after Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) coupled with RNA-Seq to characterize the genome-wide target RNA repertoire of Mili and Miwi, two mouse Piwi proteins. Our analysis outlines a model for primary piRNA biogenesis in postnatal mouse and indicates that piRNAs do not mediate target RNA recognition, but rather are the end products of RNA processing. Moreover, we identify a set of mRNAs essential for spermiogenesis that are bound and regulated by Miwi, directly implicating Piwi proteins in the control of gene expression at key time points of spermiogenesis.

Under steady-state conditions, antigen presentation by cDCs induces tolerance. In contrast, during infection or inflammation, cDCs become activated, express higher levels of cell surface MHC molecules, and induce strong adaptive immune responses. We recently identified a cDC-restricted zinc finger transcription factor, zDC, that is not expressed by other immune cell populations, including pDCs, monocytes, or macrophages. Here we define the zDC consensus DNA binding motif and the genes regulated by zDC using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing. By deleting zDC from the mouse genome, we show that zDC is primarily a negative regulator of cDC gene expression. zDC deficiency alters the cDC subset composition in the spleen in favor of CD8+ DCs, upregulates activation pathways in steady state cDCs including elevated MHC II expression, and enhances cDC production of VEGF leading to increased vascularization of skin-draining lymph nodes. Consistent with these observations, zDC protein expression is rapidly downregulated after TLR ligation. Thus, zDC is a TLR-responsive cDC-specific transcriptional repressor that is in part responsible for preventing cDC maturation in the steady state. Splenic classical dendritic cells from mice lacking the second exon of the zDC gene were sorted. DEC-205+ and DCIR2+ cDCs from the zDC knockout mice were collected for comparison with wildtype cDCs.

Here, we provide evidence for an unexpected role of trimethylated histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me3) as a repression checkpoint that restricts expression of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) target genes in macrophages. H4K20me3 is deposited at the promoters of a subset of these genes by the SMYD5 histone methyltransferase through its association with NCoR co-repressor complexes.  Signal-dependent erasure of H4K20me3 is required for effective gene activation and is achieved by NF-KB-dependent delivery of the histone demethylase PHF2.  Liver X receptors antagonize TLR4-dependent gene activation by maintaining NCoR/SMYD5-mediated repression. These findings reveal a histone H4K20 tri-methylation/de-methylation strategy that integrates positive and negative signaling inputs that control immunity and homeostasis. mRNA profiling from thioglycollate-elicited mouse macrophages treated with siRNA for Control, Smyd5 and Phf2 for 48 hours followed by 4 hours of LPS treatment. ..

However, how COX-2 promotes PDAC development is unclear. While previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of COX-2 inhibition via the use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in PDAC models, none have addressed the cell intrinsic vs. microenvironment roles of COX-2 in modulating PDAC initiation and progression.  We tested the cell intrinsic role of COX-2 in PDAC progression, using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches.  Cox-2 deletion in Pdx1+ pancreatic progenitor cells significantly delays the development of PDAC in mice with K-ras activation and Pten haploinsufficiency.  Conversely, COX-2 over-expression promotes early onset and progression of PDAC in the K-ras mouse model.  Loss of PTEN function is a critical factor in determining lethal PDAC onset and overall survival.  Mechanistically, COX-2 over-expression increases P-AKT levels in the precursor lesions of Pdx1+;K-rasG12D/+;Ptenlox/+ mice in the absence of Pten LOH. In contrast, Cox-2 deletion in the same setting diminishes P-AKT levels and delays cancer progression.  These data suggest an important cell intrinsic role for COX-2 in tumor initiation and progression through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.  PDAC that is independent of intrinsic COX-2 expression eventually develops with decreased FKBP5 and increased GRP78 expression, two alternate pathways leading to AKT activation.  Together, these results support a cell intrinsic role for COX-2 in PDAC development and suggest that, while anti-COX-2 therapy may delay the development and progression of PDAC, mechanisms known to increase chemoresistance through AKT activation must also be overcome. Murine mutants with pancreatic specific loss of Pten (Pten +/-) and K-ras activation (K-rasG12D) and either COX-2 over-expression (Cox-2 COE) or knockout (Cox-2 KO) under regulation of the Pdx-1 promoter developed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

The mechanisms by which environmental toxicants alter developmental processes predisposing individuals to chronic disease are not understood. arsenic exposure via drinking water causes cancer and cardiovascular disease. Transplacental arsenic exposure accelerates and exacerbates atherosclerosis in ApoE-knockout mice. The liver plays a central role in the interlinked diseases diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. The hypothesis that accelerated atherosclerosis is a consequence of altered hepatic development was investigated by microarray profiling of mRNA and microRNA abundance in livers isolated from 10 week old (PND70) and newborn (PND1) mice exposed or not exposed to arsenic from day 8 post-fertilization to birth. The results show that arsenic exposure alters the trajectory of both mRNA and microRNA expression as mice age. A 51-gene signature of arsenic exposure in both PND1 and PND70 mice was identified. Pathway Architect analysis of this signature identified nodes of interaction including Hspa8, IgM and Hnf4a. Gene ontology analysis of arsenic exposure-altered mRNAs indicated that pathways for gluconeogenesis and glycolysis were suppressed in PND1 mice and pathways for protein export, ribosome, antigen processing and presentation, and complement and coagulation cascades were induced in PND70 mice. Analysis of promoters of differentially expressed genes identified enriched transcription factor binding sites and cluster analyses revealed groups of genes sharing sets of transcription factor binding sites suggesting common regulation. Srebp1 binding sites are present in ~1/6 of the genes differentially expressed in PND70 livers. Western blot analyses of PND70 liver proteins showed that the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (Hspa1, Hsp70) and the active form of Srebp1 were induced in arsenic-exposed mice as were plasma AST and ALT levels. These results suggest that transplacental ar Samples from three frozen livers from each group (newborn exposed and unexposed, 10 week old exposed and unexposed), and from separate litters, were homogenized and total RNA purified using mirVANA RNA pufification kits (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA).

However, the molecular mechanisms that control lymphatic vessel network maturation and function remain largely unknown. To identify novel players in lymphatic vessel function, we isolated pure populations of lymphatic and blood vascular endothelial cells from mouse intestine using fluorescence-activated high-speed cell sorting and performed transcriptional profiling. We found that the axonal guidance molecules semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) and Sema3D were specifically expressed by lymphatic vessels. Quantitative PCR of ex vivo isolated cells and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed these results. Importantly, we found that the semaphorin receptor neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) is expressed on the valves of collecting lymphatic vessels.  Treatment of mice in utero (E12.5-E16.5) with an antibody that blocks Sema3A binding to Nrp-1, but not with an antibody that blocks VEGFA binding to Nrp-1, resulted in abnormal development of collecting lymphatic vessels and valves, and aberrant smooth muscle cell coverage. Conversely, Sema3A-deficient mice displayed branching defects of collecting lymphatic vessels as well as impaired valve development. Together, these results reveal an unanticipated role of Sema3A/Nrp-1 signaling in the maturation of the lymphatic vascular network. Colon single-cell suspensions were prepared by a fast protocol that minimizes the RNA degradation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to sort blood vascular endothelial cells (BEC) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). 4 animal-matched pairs of LEC and BEC were chosen based on the quality of extracted and amplified material to provide homogenous groups of biological replicates.

Using genome-wide approaches, we show that GC content and CGIs are major promoter elements in mammalian cells, able to govern open chromatin conformation and support paused transcription. First, we define three classes of promoters with distinct transcriptional directionality and pausing properties which correlate with their GC content. We further analyze the direct influence of GC content on nucleosome positioning and depletion, and show that CGIs correlate with nucleosome depletion both in vivo and in vitro. We also show that transcription is not essential for nucleosome exclusion but influences both a weak +1 and a well-positioned nucleosome at CGI borders. Altogether our data support the idea that CGIs have become an essential feature of promoter structure defining novel regulatory properties in mammals. Nucleosome density and positioning were studied by high-throughput sequencing of DNA previously treated with Mnase. In parallel, chIPseq for PolII and H3K27ac were performed in mouse and human with different conditions to assess a potential effect of transcription on nucleosomes properties.To investigate transcription at promoters, we analyzed together with genome-wide Pol II accumulation by ChIP-Seq, paused bidirectional transcripts associated with transcription start sites (TSS RNAs). ..

The  aqueous phase was transferred to fresh tubes and 1.5 volumes (approximately 1ml) of  isopropanol together with 10?g of linear acrylamide (Ambion, USA) were added. Samples were  vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. The precipitated RNA was pelleted  by centrifugation at 4?C and 12,000g in a tabletop centrifuge for 20 minutes. Pellets were  washed with 80% ethanol, vortexed and centrifuged at 4?C and 7,500g in a tabletop centrifuge  for 10 minutes. Pellets were allowed to air-dry and resuspended in nuclease-free water  (Ambion, USA). DNA was digested using the rigorous Turbo DNase (Ambion, USA) treatment  as per manufacturer?s instructions. RNA quantity was measured on a Nanodrop 1000 and the  quality was verified using RNA Nano chips on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA).  Small RNAs were purified from a 10% denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel, essentially as  described in the Illumina Small RNA Rev. B protocol with some minor modifications.  Approximately 10?g of total RNA was run at 200V for 1 hour, until the blue front reached the  bottom of the gel. We used 21G needles to puncture holes into the bottom of two 0.5ml and  placed them into 2ml eppendorf tubes. RNA corresponding to 15nt-70nt was cut from the gel,  diagonally cut in half and separately transferred into the 0.5ml tubes. The gel was crushed into  the 2ml tubes by a two minute centrifugation at 14,000rpm. For gel elution by soaking, 0.4ml of  0.3M NaCl was added to each tube, before a 4 hour rotation at room temperature. After removal  of gel particles using 0.22?m cellulose acetate filters, 10?g of linear acrylamide (Ambion, USA)  and 2.5 volumes (approximately 1ml) of ice-cold absolute ethanol were added. After a 30 minute  incubation at -80?C, the eluted RNA was precipitated by centrifugation at 4?C and maximum  speed for 45 minutes. The pellet was washed with 1ml of room temperature 80% ethanol and  resuspended in 5.7?l of water. This PAGE purification step was repeated after both the 5? and 3?  adapter ligations, which were carried out according to the protocol. The resulting cDNA was  purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) using the DNA cleanup protocol  modification in order to retain DNA fragments as low as 70bp. The DNA was quantified using a  Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, France) and verified using DNA High Sensitivity 2100  Bioanalyzer chips (Agilent, USA).

Excessive intramyocellular lipid storage exceeds intracellular needs and induces lipotoxic events ultimately contributing to the development of insulin resistance.  Lipid droplet (LD)-coating proteins may control proper lipid storage in skeletal muscle. Perilipin 2 (PLIN2/ADRP) is one of the most abundantly expressed LD-coating proteins in skeletal muscle. Here we examined the role of PLIN2 in myocellular lipid handling and insulin sensitivity by investigating the effects of in vitro PLIN2 knockdown and in vitro and in vivo overexpression. PLIN2 knockdown decreased LD formation and triacylglycerol storage, marginally increased FA oxidation, and increased incorporation of palmitate into diacylglycerols and phospholipids. PLIN2 overexpression in vitro increased intramyocellular TAG storage paralleled with improved insulin sensitivity. In vivo muscle-specific PLIN2 overexpression resulted in increased LD accumulation and blunted the high-fat diet-induced increase of OXPHOS protein content. Diacylglycerol levels were unchanged, while ceramide levels were increased. Despite the increased intramyocellular lipid accumulation, PLIN2 overexpression improved skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. We conclude that PLIN2 is essential for lipid storage in skeletal muscle by enhancing the partitioning of excess FAs towards triacylglycerol storage in LDs thereby blunting lipotoxicity-associated insulin resistance.

Here, we show by genome-wide mapping that the newly discovered DNA modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is dynamically associated with transcription factor binding to distal regulatory sites during neural differentiation of mouse P19 cells as well as during adipocyte differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 cells. Functional annotation reveals that regions gaining 5hmC are associated with genes expressed either in neural tissues when P19 cells undergo neural differentiation or in adipose tissue when 3T3-L1 cells undergo adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, distal regions gaining 5hmC together with H3K4me2 and H3K27ac in P19 cells behave as differentiation-dependent transcriptional enhancers. Identified regions are enriched in motifs for transcription factors regulating specific cell fates like Meis1 in P19 cells and PPARgamma in 3T3-L1 cells. Accordingly, a fraction of hydroxymethylated Meis1 sites were associated with a dynamic engagement of the 5mC hydroxylase Tet1. In addition, kinetic studies of cytosine hydroxymethylation of selected enhancers indicated that DNA hydroxymethylation is an early event of enhancer activation. Hence, acquisition of 5hmC in cell-specific distal regulatory regions may represent a major event of enhancer progression toward an active state and participate in selective activation of tissue-specific genes A 6-chip study aiming to characterize regulated genes in P19.6 mouse embryonal carcinoma cells following 48 hours treatment with 1  M all-trans retinoic acid.

Acquisition of totipotency concurs with remodeling of chromatin states of parental genomes (   epigenetic reprogramming   ), changes in maternally contributed transcriptome and proteome, and zygotic genome activation. Genomes of mature germ cells are more proficient in supporting embryonic development than those of somatic cells. It is currently unknown whether transgenerational inheritance of chromatin states present in mature gametes underlies the efficacy of early embryonic development after natural conception. Here, we show that Ring1 and Rnf2, two core components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), serve redundant gene regulatory functions during oogenesis that are required to support embryonic development beyond the two-cell stage. Numerous developmental regulatory genes that are established Polycomb targets in various somatic cell types are de-repressed in Ring1/Rnf2 double mutant (dm) fully grown germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes. Translation of tested aberrant maternal transcripts is, however, delayed until after fertilization. Exchange of maternal pro-nuclei between control and Ring1/Rnf2 maternally dm early zygotes demonstrates an essential role for Ring1 and Rnf2 during oogenesis in defining cytoplasmic and nuclear maternal contributions that are both essential for proper initiation of embryonic development. A large number of genes up-regulated in Ring1/Rnf2 dm GV oocytes harbor PRC2-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in spermatozoa and in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and are repressed during normal oogenesis and early embryogenesis. These data strongly support the model that Polycomb acts in the female and male germline to silence differentiation inducing genes and to program chromatin states, thereby sustaining developmental potential across generations.  Expression profiling of late 2-cell embryos was performed with the following genotypes: maternal Ring1-Rnf+ (control), maternal Ring1-Rnf2- (maternal Ring1/Rnf2 double mutant). These embryos were obtained by crossing Ring1-/-Rnf2F/F control females or Ring1-/-Rnf2F/F Zp3-cre expreimental females, respectively, to Ring1+/+Rnf2F/F control males. To distinguish between maternal transcripts present in the 2-cell embryo and newly (embryonicaly) transcribed transcripts, embryos from both genotypes were either not treated (expression profiling therefore shows all maternal and embryonic transcripts) or alpha-amanitin treated (alpha-amanitin inhibits de novo transcription, therefore expression profiling of treated embryos will only show maternal transcripts). 11 samples were analyzed: 3 biological replicates (except alpha-amanitin treated maternal Ring1/Rnf2 double mutant, where only 2 replicates were analyzed) of each genotype and treatment group were analyzed.

Instead, most cells undergo specific maturation events where changes in the cell transcriptome ensure that the proper gene products are expressed to carry out unique physiological functions. Pancreatic acinar cells mature post-natally to handle an extensive protein synthetic load, establsih organized apical-basal polarity for zymogen granule trafficking, and assemble gap-junctions to perimt efficient cell-cell communication. Despite significant progress in defining transcriptional networks that control initial acinar cell specification and differentiation decisions, little is know regarding the role of transcription factors in the specification and maintenance of maturation events. One candidate maturation effector is MIST1, a secretory cell-restricted transcription factor that has been implicated in controlling regulated exocytosis events in a number of cell types. Embryonic knock-out of MIST1 generates acinar cells that fail to establish an apical-basal organization, fail to properly localize zymogen granule and fail to communicate intra-cellularly, making the exocrine organ highly suceptible to pancreatic diseases. In an effort to identify the gene expression differences responsible for MIST1 regulating mature acinar properties. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model where MIST1 expression could be activated in vivoand performed gene expression arrays on wildtype, MIST1-null, and induced MIST1 pancreatic RNA.

To this end, we have generated a streamlined bioinformatic pipeline available to the scientific community, which maps RNA-Seq reads to a complex combinatorial database of exon-exon junctions for the unique junction discovery, PTC detection and identification of splice isoforms. Hence, we have incorporated a splice isoform inference and PTC detection algorithm, which facilitates a highly accurate mapping and prediction of splice isoform junctions and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)-susceptibility. We used this pipeline to investigate the complexity of the transcriptome and global role of AS-NMD in vivo in mammalian cells, by taking advantage of our Upf2 conditional knock-out mouse. Using tissue-specific Cre deleter strains, we have previously demonstrated in vivo that NMD acts to degrade many transcripts that results from AS. Also, ablating UPF2 (a core NMD factor) in the mouse leads to rapid mortality and collapse of most organs tested (Thoren et al., 2010; Weischenfeldt et al., 2008), suggesting an essential function for NMD in AS. To explore the effect of NMD on global splicing and to generate and validate an attractive bioinformatic pipeline for the scientific community to study AS and NMD, we chose to analyze two different mammalian organ systems with distinct phenotypes upon UPF2 ablation to test the robustness and dynamic range of the analysis. In one end of the spectrum, we chose to analyze the liver, wherein removal of UPF2 results in failure in liver metabolism and a high mortality rate (Thoren et al., 2010). To profile a less affected tissue, we chose to analyze bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). These are macrophages that differentiate in vitro and Upf2 deleted BMMs are completely devoid of NMD activity but nevertheless show no morphological or functional phenotype compared to wild-type controls (Weischenfeldt et al., 2008). Thus, we were able to make a direct comparison between these two tissues to demonstrate the potency of our Isoform and PTC detection pipeline described below, which will allow the scientific community to analyze transcriptome data for global AS and NMD-susceptibility.

In particular, dynamic changes in histone modifications may play central roles in the rearrangement of gene expression patterns. LSD1 (KDM1) protein, encoded by aof2 gene, is a histone demethylase, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. Since the enzymatic activity of LSD1 is FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide)-dependent, its effects on gene expression may be influenced by FAD availability. To address the importance of histone demethylation in adipogenic differentiation and function, we performed cDNA microarray in LSD1-deficient 3T3-L1 cells as well as in the cells treated with LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine (TC). FAD-synthesizing enyme, riboflavin kinase (RFK) -deficient cells were also subjected to the microarray analysis. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were transfected with  aof2- or rfk- specific siRNA or control siRNA (siGL3) . 24 hours later, cells were subjected to adipogenic induction. 24 hours later, cells were harvested for total RNA extraction.

We found that the phenotype adopted by these cells and their biological activity are influenced by changes in muscle environment. While Sca1-positive muscle interstitial cells from healthy muscles spontaneously adopt a fibro-adipogenic phenotype, Sca1-positive muscle interstitial cells isolated from dystrophic muscles of young mdx mice show a latent myogenic phenotype that is implemented by the exposure to HDACi. Co-culture assays in vitro and co-transplantation experiments in vivo demonstrate that HDACi also improve Sca1-positive muscle interstitial cell ability to enhance the differentiation potential of adjacent satellite cells. Importantly, HDACi-induced myogenic phenotype and pro-regeneration activity were not observed in Sca1-positive muscle interstitial cells isolated from muscles of old mdx mice. The different phenotype of Sca1-positive muscle interstitial cells from mdx mice at different stages of disease progression correlated with the stage-dependent beneficial effect of HDACi, which were effective only at early stages of disease. Transplantation of Sca1-positive muscle interstitial cells isolated from regenerating young muscles into muscles of old mdx mice restored HDACi ability to increase myofiber size. These results indicate that Sca1-positive muscle interstitial cells are key cellular determinants of disease progression and mediate the beneficial effect of HDACi in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved, we used a microarray system to analyze mRNA expression in SDS-treated dorsal skin of hairless mouse. Transepidermal water loss of mouse skin was increased by SDS treatment and the increase was significantly reduced by prior oral administration of glucosylceramides. Microarray-evaluated mRNA expression ratios showed statistically significant increase of expression of genes related to cornified envelope and tight junction formation versus all genes in glucosylceramide-fed/SDS-treated mouse skin. We then examined the contribution of glucosylceramide metabolites to tight junction formation of cultured keratinocytes. SDS treatment of cultured keratinocytes significantly decreased the transepidermal electrical resistance, and the decrease was significantly ameliorated in the presence of sphingosine or phytosphingosine, the major metabolites of glucosylceramide. These results suggest that oral administration of glucosylceramide improves skin barrier function by upregulating genes associated with both cornified envelope and tight junction formation.

KDM1A acts at genomic loci bound by MLL-AF9 to sustain expression of the associated oncogenic program, thus preventing differentiation and apoptosis. In vitro and in vivo pharmacologic targeting of KDM1A using tranylcypromine analogues active in the nanomolar range phenocopied Kdm1a knockdown in both murine and primary human AML cells exhibiting MLL translocations. By contrast, the clonogenic and repopulating potential of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells was spared. Our data establish KDM1A as a key effector of the differentiation block in MLL leukemia which may be selectively targeted to therapeutic effect.  To investigate the genetic program regulated by KDM1A in murine MLL-AF9 AML cells enriched for LSCs, we compared the transcriptome of KIT+Gr1+ control and Kdm1a KD cells using exon arrays soon after initiation of KD. At this time, there was no immunophenotypic evidence of differentiation in Kdm1a KD cells.

EKLF-deficient (Eklf -/-) mice die at day 14.5 of gestation from severe anemia. In this study, we demonstrate that early progenitor cells fail to undergo terminal erythroid differention in Eklf -/- embryos. To discover potential EKLF target genes responsible for the failure of erythropoiesis, transcriptional profiling was performed with RNA from wild type and Eklf -/- early erythroid progenitor cells. These analyses identified significant perturbation of a network of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, with the critical regulator of the cell cycle, E2f2, at a hub. E2f2 mRNA and protein levels were markedly decreased in Eklf -/- early erythroid progenitor cells, which showed a delay in the G1-to-S-phase transition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated EKLF occupancy at the proximal E2f2 promoter in vivo. Consistent with the role of EKLF as a chromatin modifier, EKLF binding-sites in the E2f2 promoter were located in a region of EKLF-dependent DNase I sensitivity in early erythroid progenitor cells. We propose a model in which EKLF-dependent activation and modification of the E2f2 locus is required for cell cycle progression preceding terminal erythroid differentiation.

The current data indicate that DC maturation under inflammatory conditions or by helminth infections induce only incomplete DC maturation bearing a partially tolerogenic potential. Such semi-mature DC promoted a Th2 profile with increasing proportions of regulatory IL-10 producing T cells (Tr-1) upon restimulation.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we asked whether the instruction of DC by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF is qualitatively different from maturation by two types of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) of Trypanosoma brucei. We tested differentially matured murine bone marrow (BM)-derived DC for changes in surface markers or cytokines, by microarray analyses, for their induction of Th2 responses and their capacity to influence the disease models asthma for Th2 immunity and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) for a Th1/Th17 response.  Conclusions/Significance Together, our data suggest that the partial maturation signatures induced by TNF and VSG antigens are highly similar and result in comparable Th2/Tr1 profiles, effects on asthma and EAE. This is remarkable since the responses resulting from endogenous inflammatory TNF-receptor signals or exogenous pathogenic MyD88 ligands are comparable. total samples analysed are 5 ..

CD45+ cells in tumor tissue increased 5-fold over the first 3 days after treatment, which was due largely to an influx of CD11b+ Ly6G+ neutrophils. Using murine and human multiplex cytokine assays to dissect the cytokines produced by host stromal cells or by the melanoma cells, it was shown that both the stromal cells and the A375 melanoma cells produced cytokines capable of attracting neutrophils into the tumor. The same xenografts were also analyzed using human and mouse Affymetrix microarrays to separately identify tumor cell-specific (human) and stromal cell-specific (mouse) gene expression changes. DMXAA induced numerous stromal cytokine mRNAs, including IP-10, IL-6, MIP-1  /  , MIP-2, KC, RANTES, MIG, MCP-1 and IL-1  , many of  which were also elevated at the protein level. Numerous human cytokine mRNAs were also induced including MCP-1, IL-8, GRO, VEGF, GM-CSF and IL-6, which again was in line with our protein data. Pathway analysis indicated that significant numbers of the stromal mRNAs induced by DMXAA are regulated downstream of TNF-  , interferon-   and NF  B. Our results suggest that DMXAA may have utility in combination therapy for human melanoma through the activation of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways and cytokine expression from both stromal and tumor cells, leading to haemorrhagic necrosis, neutrophil influx and growth inhibition.

While most of the fatty acids entering the cardiomyocyte are oxidized, a small portion is involved in altering gene transcription to modulate cardiometabolic functions. So far, no in vivo model has been developed enabling study of the transcriptional effects of specific fatty acids in the intact heart. In the present study, mice were given a single oral dose of synthetic triglycerides composed of one single fatty acid.  Hearts were collected 6h thereafter and used for whole genome gene expression profiling. Experiments were conducted in wild-type and PPAR     /    mice to allow exploration of the specific contribution of PPAR  . It was found that: 1) linolenic acid (C18:3) had the most pronounced effect on cardiac gene expression. 2) The largest similarity in gene regulation was observed between linoleic acid (C18:2) and C18:3. Large similarity was also observed between the synthetic PPAR   agonist Wy14643 and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6). 3) Many genes were regulated by one particular treatment only. Genes regulated by one particular treatment showed large functional divergence. 4) The majority of genes responding to fatty acid treatment were regulated in a PPAR  -dependent manner, emphasizing the importance of PPAR   in mediating transcriptional regulation by fatty acids in the heart. 5) Several genes were robustly regulated by all or many of the fatty acids studied, mostly representing well-described targets of PPARs (e.g. Acot1, Angptl4, Ucp3). 6) Deletion and activation of PPAR   had a major effect on expression of numerous genes involved in metabolism and immunity. Our analysis demonstrates the marked impact of dietary fatty acids on gene regulation in the heart via PPAR  .

Although the primary neurodegeneration in PD involves nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, more extensive yet regionally selective neurodegeneration is observed in other synucleinopathies.  Furthermore, SNCA is ubiquitously expressed in neurons and numerous neuronal systems are dysfunctional in PD. Therefore it is of interest to understand how overexpression of SNCA affects neuronal function in regions not directly targeted for neurodegeneration in PD. To gain a better understanding of the consequences of excessive SNCA expression on basal ganglia function, we performed transcriptome analysis of striatal tissue from male Thy1-aSyn-mice and wt littermates. The present study investigated the consequences of SNCA overexpression on cellular processes and functions in the striatum of mice overexpressing wild-type, human SNCA under the Thy1 promoter (Thy1-aSyn mice) by transcriptome analysis.  The analysis revealed alterations in multiple biological processes in the striatum of Thy1-aSyn mice, including synaptic plasticity, signaling, transcription, apoptosis, and neurogenesis. The present study investigated the consequences of SNCA overexpression on cellular processes and functions in the striatum of mice overexpressing wild-type, human SNCA under the Thy1 promoter (Thy1-aSyn mice) by transcriptome analysis.  The analysis revealed alterations in multiple biological processes in the striatum of Thy1-aSyn mice, including synaptic plasticity, signaling, transcription, apoptosis, and neurogenesis. Animal care was conducted in accordance with the U. S. Public Health Service Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and procedures were approved by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), I.A.C.U. Committee.  Transgenic (tg) mice overexpressing human wt SNCA under the Thy-1 promoter (Thy1-aSyn) created previously in a mixed C57BL/6-DBA background were kept in this background by breeding mutant females with wt males.  Only male mice were used in the study. The genotype of all tg and wt mice was verified by PCR analysis of tail DNA. Animals were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with free access to water and food. Six-month old male Thy1-aSyn and wt littermates were sacrificed by decapitation.  For microarray analysis, whole striata from each hemisphere were immediately dissected and pooled for each brain. Tissue was permeated in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at - 80   C until used for RNA preparation. For PCR verification of transcriptional changes and for protein extracts preparation, brains from 5 male Thy1-aSyn and 5 wt littermates were obtained as above but then the brains were placed in a metal brain mold with grooves to ensure reproducible cutting of thick brain slices. A first coronal cut was made with a razor blade to remove the frontal part of the brain (at bregma + 1mm, at the anterior level of striatum). The following 1mm coronal slice (including the striatum but no globus pallidus) was used to dissect out striatal tissue.  A horizontal cut was made through the anterior commissures to exclude the nucleus accumbens. One cube of striatum was dissected out from each hemisphere, taking care not to include any corpus callosum, choroid plexus, or subventricular zone.  Samples were stored at -80   C until further processing.  Total RNA was extracted from striata of Thy1-aSyn and wt littermates (all males) with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), followed by a clean-up step with RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and RNA integrity check using a Bioanalyzer  (Agilent Tech., Foster city, CA). RNA samples were pooled, one pool representing the six control wt mice and the other representing the six SNCA overexpressing animals.  After synthesis, using Superscript (Invitrogen) and labeling using the ENZO labeling kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA), cRNA probes were hybridized to mouse MOE-430A GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix) following the manufacturer   s protocol at the UCLA microarray core facility.  Significant differential gene expression between pooled tg and wt samples was ascertained by estimation of signal log2 ratios (or fold changes in expression values), after quality control checks, data normalization and estimating expression values using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 Software (MAS 5.0).  After pairwise comparisons and filtering of this gene list using the following criteria: change p-value <0.005 for induce genes, change p-value > 0.995 for decreased genes, signal log2 ratio > 0.6 (> 1.52 fold change), excluding probes called absent in both groups, a list of differentially expressed genes was generated. We used various statistical softwares and databases to ascertain pathways affected by overexpression of SNCA that are associated with overrepresented genes in this gene list, including, the functional annotation tools accessible through DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov ) .. 6 month;  Male;  C57BL/6-DBA;  Transgenic (tg) mice overexpressing human wt SNCA under the Thy-1 promoter  in C57BL/6-DBA background;  Wild type mice in  C57BL/6-DBA background;  total RNA;  Mouse striatum from 6 six-month old transgenic animals overexpressing alpha synuclein;  Mouse striatum from 6 six-month old wild-type animals;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Striatum;  Transgenic (tg) mice overexpressing human wt SNCA under the Thy-1 promoter (Thy1-aSyn) created in a mixed C57BL/6-DBA background were kept in this background by breeding mutant females with wt males.;

Following hair regeneration, SCs within the bulge and its vicinity (upper ORS which becomes the bulge for the next cycle) briefly self-renew to replenish expended SCs and ensure long-term tissue regeneration. We used microarrays to detect the relative levels of global gene expression influenced by transcription factor Tbx1 in order to gain insight into how Tbx1 is invovled in regulating hair follicle SC self-renewal and long-term regeneration. Fourty eight hours after deplicaiton induced hair regeneration, hair follicle SCs were FACS-purified for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Here, we show that reprogramming in the presence of ascorbic acid attenuates hypermethylation of Dlk1-Dio3 by enabling a chromatin configuration at its imprint control region that interferes with abnormal binding of the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a. This approach allowed us to generate adult all-iPSC mice from mature B cells, which have thus far failed to support the development of exclusively iPSC-derived postnatal mice. Our data demonstrate that factor-mediated reprogramming can endow a defined, terminally differentiated cell type with a developmental potential equivalent to that of embryonic stem cells.

In order to elucidate the roles of b-arrestins in tumour developement in intestinal epithelium initiated by Apc mutation, we determined the effects of b-arrestin gene deletion on intestinal polypolis using ApcD14/+ mice, a relevant mouse model of human intestinal tumorigenesis.Here we show that unlike b-arrestin1, absence of b-arrestin2 dramatically decreased the number of spontaneously developping intestinal tumors in ApcD14/+ mice.The size of residual tumors was similarto that of controls, suggesting that their growth is b-arrestin2-independent. This result demonstrated a role for b-arrestin2 in the early development of a tumor subset. Gene expression profils analysis of ApcD14/+:Arrb2+/+ and ApcD14/+:Arrb2-/- tumors showed two distinct clusters among ApcD14/+:Arrb2+/+ tumors and one of them was statistically more correlated to ApcD14/+:Arrb2-/- tumors than to the other ApcD14/+:Arrb2+/+ cluster, eventhough a number of genes saw their expression affected in ApcD14/+:Arrb2-/- tumors only.

High genome coverage allowed for a novel quantitative analysis of local methylation states, which identified Low Methylated Regions (LMR) with an average methylation of 30%. These regions are evolutionary conserved, reside outside of CpG islands and distal to promoters. They represent regulatory regions evidenced by their DNaseI hypersensitivity and chromatin marks of enhancer elements. LMRs are occupied by transcription factors (TF) and their reduced methylation requires TF binding while introduction of TF binding sites creates LMRs de novo. This dependency on TF activity is further evident when comparing the methylomes of embryonic stem cells and derived neuronal cells. LMRs present in both cell types are occupied by broadly expressed factors, while LMRs present at only one state are occupied by cell-type specific TFs. Methylome data can thus enhance the prediction of occupied TF binding sites and identification of active regulatory regions genome-wide. Our study provides reference methylomes for the mouse at two cell states, identifies a novel and highly dynamic feature of the epigenome that defines distal regulatory elements and shows that transcription factor binding dynamically shapes mammalian methylomes.

Furthermore, the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype is suggested to exert a modulating effect on the association between early life stress and the risk for depression. In the present study, we use a 5-HTT x PS paradigm to investigate whether the effects of PS are dependent upon the 5-HTT genotype.  Methods: The effects of PS on cognition, anxiety- and depression-related behaviour were examined using a maternal restraint stress paradigm of PS in C57BL6 wild-type (WT) and heterozygous (+/-) 5-HTT knockout mice. Additionally, in the female offspring, a genome-wide hippocampal gene expression screening was performed.  Results: 5-HTT +/- offspring showed enhanced memory performance and signs of reduced anxiety as compared to WT offspring. Conversely, exposure of 5-HTT +/- mice to PS was associated with altered stress-responsivity and increased depressive-like behaviour, particularly in female offspring. Further, 5-HTT genotype, PS and their interaction differentially affected the expression of numerous genes and related pathways within the female hippocampus. Specifically, MAPK and neurotrophin signalling were regulated by both the 5-HTT +/- genotype and PS exposure, whereas cytokine and Wnt signalling were affected in a 5-HTT genotype x PS manner, indicating a gene x environment interaction at the molecular level.  Conclusions: The long-term behavioural effects of PS in C57BL6 mice are partly dependent on the 5-HTT genotype. Further, hippocampal gene expression profiles suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms mediate the behavioural effects of the 5-HTT genotype, PS exposure, and their interaction. total samples analysed are 12 ..

In murine skin, epidermal stem cells cluster at specific niches where, under steady-state conditions, they undergo cycles of dormancy and activation1. When cellular replenishment is required, epidermal stem cells egress from the niche and proliferate for a limited number of times to subsequently feed into the differentiated compartment1-3. However, only a subset of stem cells becomes active during each round of morphogenesis, suggesting that stem cells coexist in heterogeneous responsive states within the same niche. Using a circadian clock fluorescent reporter mouse model, we show that the dormant epidermal stem cell niche contains two coexisting populations of stem cells at opposite phases of the clock, which are differentially predisposed to respond to homeostatic cues. In dormant niches, the core molecular clock protein Bmal1 transcriptionally modulates the expression of stem cell regulatory genes, including modulators of Wnt and TGFb, to create two coexisting stem cell populations, one predisposed, and the other less prone, to activation. Unbalancing this equilibrium of epidermal stem cells, through conditional epidermal deletion of Bmal1, resulted in a long-term progressive accumulation of non-responsive stem cells, premature impairment of tissue self-renewal, and a significant reduction in the development of squamous cell carcinomas. Our results indicate that the molecular clock machinery fine-tunes the spatiotemporal behavior of epidermal stem cells within their niche, and that perturbation of this mechanism affects tissue homeostasis and the predisposition to neoplastic transformation. The goals of this study was to compare the transcriptome of epidermal stem cells according to their circadian rhythm phase. We isolated epidermal stem cells (bulge cells; alpha6bright/CD34+ population) from 19 days old Per1-Venus mice and separated them according to Venusbright (clock positive) and Venus dim (clock negative). The goals of this study was to compare the transcriptome of epidermal stem cells in which their circadian rhythm machinery has been perturbed by deleting the gene that encodes for Bmal1. We compared the transcriptomes of basal interfollicular epidermis cells (alpha6 integrin bright/CD34- cells) from the dorsal skin of 1 year old BmalKO mice and their respective control littermates. Each array corresponds to purified cells from approximately 5 mice. We profiled three samples of Venus bright and three of Venus dim epidermal stem cells. Each sample consisted of epidermal stem cells isolated from aproximately 20 mice (in order to obtain enough number of cells to perform high quality arrays). We profiled three WT samples and 3 KO samples. Each sample corresponds to basal interfollicular epidermis cells purified from 5 mice. ..

We report here a new regulatory role of p27Kip1 as a transcriptional regulator. In association with transcriptional repressors such as p130, E2F4 and HDACs, p27 binds to promoters of multiple genes leading to their repression. The p27Kip1-target genes participate in RNA processing, translation, respiration and cell cycle. Remarkably, p27Kip1-target genes are over-expressed in different human tumors in tight association with a poor clinical prognosis. We also observed a clear correlation between low levels of p27Kip1 and over-expression of p27Kip1-target genes in tumors. Overall, our findings indicate new tumor suppressor roles of p27Kip1 as a transcriptional regulator of genes relevant for oncogenesis.

Mutations in genes encoding a ribosomal protein of the small (e.g. Rps19) or large (e.g. Rpl11) ribosomal subunit are found in over half of these patients. The mutations cause   ribosomal haploinsufficiency, which reduces overall translation efficiency of cellular mRNAs. We reduced expression of *Rps19* or *Rpl11* in mouse erythroblasts and investigated mRNA polyribosome association, which revealed deregulated translation initiation of specific transcripts. Among these were *Bag1*, encoding a Hsp70 co-chaperone, and *Csde1*, encoding an RNA binding protein, both expressed at increased levels in erythroblasts. Their translation initiation is cap-independent and starts from an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), which appeared sensitive to knock down of Rps19 or Rpl11. Mouse embryos lacking Bag1 die at embryonic day E13.5 with reduced erythroid colony forming cells in the fetal liver, and low Bag1 expression impairs erythroid differentiation in vitro. Reduced expression of Csde1 impairs proliferation and differentiation of erythroid blasts. Protein but not mRNA expression of *BAG1* and *CSDE1* was reduced in erythroblasts cultured from DBA patients. Our data suggest that impaired IRES-mediated translation of mRNAs expressed at increased levels in erythroblasts contributes to the erythroid phenotype of DBA. 3 biological replicates of erythroblasts treated with different shRNA were used for polyribosomal sucrose gradients; RNA was extracted from gradients in 2 samples - mRNA associated with polyribosomes (poly) and the rest (sub). .. poly;  sub;  total RNA;  none;  rpl11;  rps19;  sc;  erythrobalsts;  10090;  Mus musculus;  3 days after shRNA lentiviral delivery the cells were treated with cycloheximide, harvested and frozen on nitrogen.;

CPF is converted to chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO) by oxidative desulfuration in liver.  Paraoxonase (PON1) polymorphisms affects the catalytic efficiency of the hydrolysis of OPs, including CPO. We used both wt (PON1+/+) and PON1 knockout (PON1-/-) mice and PON1-/- mice carrying transgenes encoding the human alloforms tgHuPON1Q192 and tgHuPON1R192 to gain insight into the mechanisms of neurotoxicity of CPO throughout postnatal development, and to ascertain the importance of the PON1Q192R polymorphism for protecting against developmental toxicity of CPO. Whole-genome microarrays were used to measure gene expression changes associated with chronic CPO exposure of developing (PND 4-21) PON1-/-, tgHuPON1Q192R transgenic and PON1+/+ mice.

Good manufacturing practices (GMP) and sophisticated product analysis (PhytomicsQC) to ensure consistency are now available allowing the assessment of its utility. Polychemical Medicines, like TCM, include chemicals with distinct tissue-dependent pharmacodynamic properties that result in tissue-specific bioactivity. Determining the mode of action of these mixtures was previously unsatisfactory; however, information rich RNA microarray technologies now allow for thorough mechanistic studies about complex mixtures effects. PHY906 is a long used four herb TCM formula employed as adjuvant to relieve side effects associated with chemotherapy. Animal studies documented a decrease in global toxicity and an increase in therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy when PHY906 was combined. Using a systems biology approach, we studied tumor tissue to identify reasons for the enhancement of the antitumor effect of Irinotecan by PHY-906 in a well-characterized pre-clinical model; PHY-906 and Irinotecan were administered orally to female BDF-1 mice bearing subcutaneous Colon 38 tumors. We observed that 1) individually PHY-906 and Irinotecan induce distinct alterations in tumor, liver and spleen; 2) PHY-906 alone predominantly induces repression of transcription and immune-suppression in tumors; 3) these effects are reverted in the presence of Irinotecan, with prevalent induction of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory pathways that may favor tumor rejection. Most importantly, PHY-906 together with Irinotecan triggers unique changes not activated by each one alone suggesting that the combination creates a unique tissue-specific response. Four groups of BDF-1 mice bearing colon 38 tumors were treated with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (n=10), PHY-906 (n=10), Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar(TM)) (n=10) or the combination PHY-906 and Irinotecan (n=10).

Although significant progress has been made in genome-wide profiling for quantitative changes in cardiac gene expression, current knowledge offers limited insights to the total complexity in cardiac transcriptome at individual exon level. To develop more robust bioinformatic approaches to analyze high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, with the focus on the investigation of transcriptome complexity at individual exon and transcript levels. In addition to overall gene expression analysis, the methods developed in this study were used to analyze RNA-Seq data with respect to individual transcript isoforms, novel spliced exons, novel alternative terminal exons, novel transcript clusters (i.e., novel genes) and long non-coding RNA genes. We applied these approaches to RNA-Seq data obtained from mouse hearts following pressure-overload induced by trans-aortic constriction. Based on experimental validations, analyses of the features of the identified exons/transcripts, and expression analyses including previously published RNA-Seq data, we demonstrate that the methods are highly effective in detecting and quantifying individual exons and transcripts. Novel insights inferred from the examined aspects of the cardiac transcriptome open ways to further experimental investigations. Our work provided a comprehensive set of methods to analyze mouse cardiac transcriptome complexity at individual exon and transcript levels. Applications of the methods may infer important new insights to gene regulation in normal and disease hearts in terms of exon utilization and potential involvement of novel components of cardiac transcriptome.

How a single signal induces highly complex temporally controlled networks that ultimately orchestrate physiological processes is unclear. Using an RA-inducible differentiation model we defined the temporal changes in the genome-wide binding patterns of RARg and RXRa and correlated them with transcription regulation. Unexpectedly, both receptors displayed a highly dynamic binding, with different RXRa heterodimers targeting identical loci. Comparison of RARg and RXRa co-binding at RA-regulated genes identified putative RXRa-RARg target genes that were validated with subtype-selective agonists. Gene regulatory decisions during differentiation were inferred from transcription factor target gene information and temporal gene expression.  This analysis revealed 6 distinct co-expression paths of which RXRa-RARg is associated with transcription activation, while Sox2 and Egr1 were predicted to regulate repression. Finally, RXRa-RARg regulatory networks were reconstructed through integration of functional co-citations. Our analysis provides a dynamic view of RA signalling during cell differentiation, reveals RA heterodimer dynamics and promiscuity, and predicts decisions that diversify the RA signal into distinct gene-regulatory programs.

Although core clock gene defects that eradicate circadian rhythmicity can cause an altered in vivo genotoxic stress response and aberrant proliferation rate, it remains to be determined to what extent these cell-cycle-related phenotypes are due to a cell-autonomous lack of circadian oscillations. We investigated the DNA damage sensitivity and proliferative capacity of cultured primary Cry1-/- Cry2-/- fibroblasts. Contrasting previous in vivo studies, we show that the absence of CRY proteins does not affect the cell-autonomous DNA damage response upon exposure of primary cells in vitro to genotoxic agents, but causes cells to proliferate faster. By comparing primary wild type, Cry1-/- Cry2-/-, Cry1+/- Cry2-/- and Cry1-/- Cry2+/- fibroblasts, we provide evidence that CRY proteins influence cell cycle progression in a cell-autonomous, but circadian clock-independent manner and that the accelerated cell cycle progression of Cry-deficient cells is caused by global dysregulation of Bmal1-dependent gene expression. These results suggest that the inconsistency between in vivo and in vitro observations might be attributed to systemic circadian control rather than a direct cell-autonomous control.

However, this is still a challenge in human, partly due to the difficulty of analyzing the early stages of the disease. In this context, genetically engineered mice represent a valuable alternative to model human carcinogenesis. Here, we studied cancer development in c-Myc/Tgfa transgenic mice that developed liver tumors which closely reproduce a subset of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a poor prognosis. By using a functional genomics approach from early to late stages of HCC development, we demonstrated that hepatocarcinogenesis in c-Myc/Tgfa mice resulted from a progressive accumulation of transcriptional alterations due to an active hepatocyte proliferation in a chronic oxidative stress environment generated by a general metabolic disorder. One striking observation was the deregulation of numerous immune-related genes starting from an early stage of the disease. Particularly, we showed that activating ligands for natural killer (NK) cells were specifically induced in dysplastic hepatocytes which simultaneously lost the expression of MHC-I molecules. Besides this early mechanism of NK-mediated immune surveillance, we further reported a drastic decrease in hepatic NK cell population which may indeed contribute to the emergence and clonal expansion of progenitors for liver tumors. In conclusion, our study provided a detailed and comprehensive characterization of hepatocarcinogenesis in c-Myc/Tgfa transgenic mice and emphasized the critical role of the innate immune surveillance disruption at the early stages of liver cancer. In the present study, we reported a detailed and comprehensive dynamic characterization of the cellular and molecular alterations involved in tumor onset and progression in the liver of c-Myc/Tgfa double-transgenic mice (B6CBAxCD1 background). Liver samples from male animals were collected at  various time-points ranging from 3 weeks to 9 months for c-Myc/Tgfa double-transgenic mice, or 18 months for c-Myc and Tgfa single-transgenic mice. Tissue samples  were divided into two parts; one was fixed in 10% formalin for histological evaluation and the other was used for RNA analysis. Total RNAs were isolated from livers with moderate or severe hepatocyte dysplasia (at 3 weeks and 3 months, respectively), as well as from HCC and surrounding non-tumor livers (5-15 mice per group). Total RNAs were also isolated from the livers of B6CBAxCD1 wild-type mice at 3 weeks and 3 months. RNAs isolated from the normal livers of B6CBA WT mice (3 months old, n=10) were pooled and used as a common technical reference for all microarray experiments. .. 18 months;  3 months;  3 weeks;  9 months;  male;  Tgfa transgenic;  c-Myc transgenic;  c-Myc/Tgfa double-transgenic;  wild-type;  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC);  mild hepatocyte dysplasia;  normal;  severe hepatocyte dysplasia;  total RNA;  #1;  #10;  #2;  #3;  #4;  #5;  #6;  #7;  #8;  #9;  10T1;  11T1;  13T2;  14T;  15T1;  16T1;  17;  18;  19;  1T;  1T1;  2;  20;  21;  22;  23;  24;  2T;  2T2;  3;  30;  31;  32;  33;  34;  3T;  3T1;  4;  4T;  4T3;  5T;  5T2;  5T3;  6T;  6T1;  6T2;  7T1;  7T3;  8T1;  8T5;  9T1;  reference;  Myc/Tgfa, dysplastic liver, 3 months;  Myc/Tgfa, dysplastic liver, 3 weeks;  Myc/Tgfa, surrounding tissue, 9 months;  Myc/Tgfa, tumor, 9 months;  Normal mouse liver, 3 months;  Normal mouse liver, 3 weeks;  Reference RNA;  Tgfa, tumor, 18 months;  c-Myc, tumor, 18 months;  B6CBA;  B6CBAxCD1;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  Liver samples from male animals were collected at various time-points ranging from 3 weeks to 18 months.

To study the effect of mucus degradation on the host response, germ-free mice were colonized with Akkermansia muciniphila. This anaerobic bacterium belonging to the Verrucomicrobia is specialized in the degradation of mucin, the glycoprotein present in mucus, and found in high numbers in the intestinal tract of human and other mammalian species. Efficient colonization of A. muciniphila was observed with highest numbers in the cecum, where most mucin is produced. In contrast, following colonization by Lactobacillus plantarum, a facultative anaerobe belonging to the Firmicutes that ferments carbohydrates, similar cell-numbers were found at all intestinal sites. Whereas A. muciniphila was located closely associated with the intestinal cells, L. plantarum was exclusively found in the lumen. The global transcriptional host response was determined in intestinal biopsies and revealed a consistent, site-specific, and unique modulation of about 750 genes in mice colonized by A. muciniphila and over 1500 genes after colonization by L. plantarum. Pathway reconstructions showed that colonization by A. muciniphila altered mucosal gene expression profiles toward increased expression of genes involved in immune responses and cell fate determination, while colonization by L. plantarum led to up-regulation of lipid metabolism. These indicate that the colonizers induce host responses that are specific per intestinal location. In conclusion, we propose that A. muciniphila modulates pathways involved in establishing homeostasis for basal metabolism and immune tolerance toward commensal microbiota.  Keywords: Analysis of target gene regulation by using microarrays Adult germ-free female NMRI-KI mice (45     65 days) were used for bacterial mono-association.

The LGI diet enhanced whole body insulin sensitivity and repressed high fat diet-induced body and adipose tissue weight gain, resulting in reduced serum leptin and resistin levels (Faseb J 2009; 23: 1092-1101). How white adipose tissue (WAT) is effected is examined in the present study. We characterized the molecular mechanisms underlying the GI-mediated effects in WAT using whole genome transcriptomics technology. We show that a LGI vs. HGI diet mainly exerts its beneficial effects on substrate metabolism, especially insulin signaling of fatty acid metabolism. In addition, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling showed reduced expression in line with lower WAT mass, but it might also be due to altered insulin sensitivity. An important transcription factor showing enhanced expression is PPARgamma. Furthermore, serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol were significantly reduced by a LGI vs. HGI diet, and muscle insulin sensitivity was significantly increased as analyzed by PKB/Akt phosphorylation. Cumulatively, even though these mice were fed a high fat diet, the low versus high GI induced significantly favorable changes in metabolism in WAT. These effects suggest a partial overlap with pharmacological approaches by thiazolidinediones (TZDs) to treat insulin resistance and statins and plantsterols/stanols for hypercholesterolemia. It is therefore tempting to speculate that such a dietary approach might beneficially support pharmacological treatment of insulin resistance or hypercholesterolemia in humans. We analyzed 19 epididymal whie adipose tissue (epiWAT) samples from a 13 week High fat diet, Low glycemic index dietary group (LGI, n=9) versus a High fat diet, High glycemic index dietary group (HGI, n=10) after 13 weeks of feeding wildtype C57BL/6J male adult mice.

Horizontal cells and cone photoreceptors share a particularly intimate functional relationship but have been previously thought to develop through separate and distinct intrinsic molecular processes.  We demonstrate that the zinc finger transcription factor Sall3 regulates development of both S-cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells.  Our data shows that loss of function of Sall3 down-regulates the horizontal cell specific transcription factor Lhx1 and subsequently causes ectopic formation of horizontal-like wide-field amacrine cells partially phenocopying Lhx1-/- mice.  Additionally, horizontal cells which laminate appropriately in Sall3 knockout mice show abnormal horizontal cell gene expression and failures in dendritic arborization.  Over-expression of Sall3 also partially re-specifies cells to a horizontal-like wide-field amacrine fate.  Intriguingly, Sall3 loss of function experiments also generated a massive reduction in the number of S-cone photoreceptors with remaining S-cones showing deficiencies in S-cone gene expression and morphology.  Conversely, over-expression of Sall3 resulted in the ectopic expression of the S-cone specific genes S-opsin (Sop) and cone arrestin (Arr3) in electroporated cells.  Our studies reveal that Sall3 regulates aspects of horizontal cell development in two ways: first, by maintaining Lhx1 expression, and second, by directly regulating expression of horizontal cell specific genes.  We also show that Sall3 is an essential regulator of S-cone development in the mammalian retina and a potent activator of Sop and Arr3. Sall3 wild-type and knockout retinas used for explant cultures were extracted by microdissection at P0 in sterile PBS. Four cuts were made using micro-dissection scissors and the retinas were transferred to Nucleopore Track-Etch membrane filters (Whatman) and the tissue flattened out evenly.

Mouse models have convincingly shown that Kras mutation induces classical PanIN lesions that can progress to PDAC in the appropriate tumor suppressor background. However, the cooperative mechanism between mutant Kras-dependent signaling surrogates and other oncogenic pathways remains to be fully elucidated in order to devise better therapeutic strategy. Mounting evidence PTEN/PI3K perturbation on PDAC tumorigenesis, we observed frequent PTEN inactivation at both genomic and histopathological levels in primary human PDAC samples. The importance of PTEN/PI3K pathway during the development of PDAC was further supported by genetic studies demonstrating that Pten deficiency in cooperation with Kras activation accelerated the formation of invasive PDAC. Mechanistically, combined Kras mutation and Pten inactivation leads to NFkB activation and subsequent induction of cytokine pathways, accompanied with strong stromal activation and immune cell infiltration. Therefore, PTEN/PI3K pathway dictates the activity of NFkB network and serves as a major surrogate during Kras-mediated pancreatic tumorigenesis.

We have previously shown that Sle1c contributes to lupus pathogenesis by conferring CD4+ T cell-intrinsic hyperactivation and increased susceptibility to chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) that mapped to the centromeric portion of the locus.  In this study, we have refined the centromeric sublocus to a 675Kb interval, termed Sle1c2.  Recombinant congenic strains expressing Sle1c2 exhibited a T cell-intrinsic CD4+ T cell hyperactivation and cGVHD susceptibility, similar to mice with the parental Sle1c. We performed a microarray analysis on CD4+ T cells to gain insights into the transcriptional programs that regulate the hyperactivation conferred by Sle1c2. CD4+ T cell cDNA was prepared from spenocytes from 5 mice from each strain and B6.Sle1c2 gene expression was compared to B6 gene expresion. .. 6 months;  CD4+ T cells;  female;  total RNA;  CD4+ T cells from B6 mice;  CD4+ T cells from B6.Sle1c2 mice;  B6;  B6.Sle1c2;  10090;  Mus musculus;  CD4+ T cells were enriched from splenocytes using magnetic bead negative selection (Miltenyi).;

To address this, we performed loss-of-function studies on most lincRNAs expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and characterized the effects on gene expression. Here we show that knockdown of lincRNAs have major consequences on gene expression patterns, comparable to knockdown of well-known ESC regulators. Notably, lincRNAs primarily affect gene expression in trans. We identify dozens of lincRNAs whose knockdown causes an exit from the pluripotent state or upregulation of lineage commitment programs. We integrate lincRNAs into the molecular circuitry of ESCs and show that lincRNA genes are regulated by key transcription factors and that lincRNA transcripts physically bind to multiple chromatin regulatory proteins to affect shared gene expression programs. Together, the results demonstrate that lincRNAs have key roles in the circuitry controlling ESC state. We generated five lentiviral-based shRNAs targeting each of the 237 lincRNAs previously identified in ESCs. These shRNAs successfully targeted 147 lincRNAs and reduced their expression by an average of ~75% compared to endogenous levels in ESCs. As positive controls, we generated shRNAs targeting ~50 genes encoding regulatory proteins, including both transcription factor and chromatin factor genes that have been shown to play critical roles in ESC regulation; we obtained validated hairpins against 40 of these genes. As negative controls, we performed independent infections with lentiviruses containing 27 different shRNAs with no known cellular target RNA. ..

SRT1720, a novel compound developed as a specific and potent activator of Sirt1, has shown promising effects to glucose homeostasis in short-term studies of rats and mice. Here we show SRT1720 extends both mean and maximum lifespan of mice fed a high-fat diet and has concrete benefits to health including reduced liver steatosis and increased insulin sensitivity and locomotor activity. Gene expression profiles and markers of inflammation and apoptosis were also restored to levels more reflective of standard diet controls. Furthermore, the benefits incurred by SRT1720 occurred in the absence of any observable toxicity. The current findings provide hope that safe and effective treatments may be developed to mitigate age-related diseases and enhance lifespan in humans.

Suppression of Myb in established AML in vivo terminates aberrant self-renewal and triggers a terminal myeloid differentiation program that precisely phenocopies the effects of suppressing MLL-AF9. Remarkably, suppressing Myb effectively eradicates aggressive and chemotherapy resistant AML. To further investigate Myb dependent transcriptional programs involved in mediating aberrant self-renewal in leukemia, we globally surveyed gene expression changes following acute shRNA-induced suppression of Myb in an established Tet-on competent model of MLL-AF9;NrasG12D-induced AML. To enable regulatable suppression of Myb in AML, we retrovirally transduced established Tet-on competent MLL-AF9;NrasG12D induced AML cells with TRMPV-Neo vectors (Zuber et al., Nature Biotech, 2010) harboring shRNAs targeting Myb (shMyb.2572 and shMyb.2652), a control shRNA targeting Renilla Luciferase (shRen.713), or an empty miR30 cassette of the recipient cloning vector (Rec).

Tcf1 deficient progenitors fail to initiate the T lineage program in vitro and development is severely defective in vivo. We used microarrays to assess the overal global gene expression differences from Tcf1 wildtype and deficient lymphoid biased progenitors cultures on Notch-ligand expressing stroma to determine if Tcf1 deficient progenitors are able to intiate the T lineage specification program. Abstract of manuscript: The thymus imposes the T cell fate on incoming multipotent progenitors, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We show that transcription factor Tcf1 initiates T-lineage-specific gene expression. Tcf1 is downstream of Notch1 signaling and expressed in early T-cell progenitors. Progenitors deficient for Tcf1 are unable to initiate normal T-lineage specification. Conversely, ectopic expression of Tcf1 in hematopoietic progenitors is sufficient to induce expression of T-lineage specific genes in vitro.  Thus, our study identifies Tcf1 as critically involved in the establishment T cell identity. Tcf1 wildtype and deficient bone marrow lymphoid primed progenitors (LMPPs, Lineage marker- Sca+kit+Flt3high) were harvested in triplicate and seeded onto OP9-DL4 expressing stroma for 4 days upon which highly pure lineage negative and Thy1+CD25+ T cells were cell sorted for expression analysis. The lineage negative populations represent three seperate mice from each genotype and the Thy1+CD25+T lineage population represents two replicates from the Tcf1 wildtype group.

To evaluate the efficacy of two different sources of   -3 PUFAs, we performed gene expression profiling in the liver of mice fed diets supplemented with either fish oil or krill oil. We found that   -3 PUFA supplements derived from a phospholipid krill fraction (krill oil) downregulated the activity of pathways involved in hepatic glucose production as well as lipid and cholesterol synthesis. The data also suggested that krill oil-supplementation increases the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Surprisingly, an equimolar dose of EPA and DHA derived from fish oil modulated fewer pathways than a krill oil-supplemented diet and did not modulate key metabolic pathways regulated by krill oil, including glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Moreover, fish oil upregulated the cholesterol synthesis pathway, which was the opposite effect of krill supplementation. Neither diet elicited changes in plasma levels of lipids, glucose or insulin, probably because the mice used in this study were young and were fed a low fat diet. Further studies of krill oil supplementation using animal models of metabolic disorders and/or diets with a higher level of fat may be required to observe these effects.

Both test diets were based on modifications of the Control diet and were formulated by substituting the soybean oil (4% in the Control diet) with either 1.1% fish oil or 1.5% krill oil. Fish and krill oil diets did not differ considerably in the total amount of ?-3 PUFAs as the content of EPA and DHA in the diets were 0.31% (fish oil diet) and 0.29% (krill oil diet).

This observation is used clinically for melanoma patients with primary melanomas thicker than 1mm (tumor stage    T2a), for these patients sentinel lymph node biopsy has become an important and routinely performed diagnostic procedure. The importance of sentinel node analysis is reflected by a significant better prognosis of melanoma patients with tumor free sentinel nodes compared to patients with metastatic sentinel nodes. Although intensively studied, not much is known about mechanisms responsible for the development of melanoma metastasis.To analyze gene expression in mouse SLNs of M24met tumor bearing animals as compared to tumor free control animals, SLNs were taken at different time points and analyzed for the presence of human M24met to classify SLNs into control, negative, macro metastatic SLN. After categorized SLNs were subjected to microarray analysis. To analyze gene expression in mouse SLNs of human M24met tumor bearing animals as compared to tumor free control animals, SLNs were taken at different time points and analyzed for the presence of human M24met to classify SLNs into control, negative, macro metastatic SLN.

In contrast to LV hypertrophy, little is known about the molecular circuits, which are activated upon RV hypertrophy (RVH). We established a highly reproducible model of RVH in mice using pulmonary artery clipping (PAC), which avoids detrimental RV pressure overload and thus allows long-term survival of operated mice. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed pathognomonic changes with striking similarities to human congenital heart disease- or pulmonary arterial hypertension- patients. Comparative, microarray based transcriptome analysis of right- and left-ventricular remodeling identified distinct transcriptional responses to pressure-induced hypertrophy of either ventricle, which were mainly characterized by stronger transcriptional responses of the RV compared to the LV myocardium. Hierarchic cluster analysis revealed a RV- and LV-specific pattern of gene activity after induction of hypertrophy, however, we did not find evidence for qualitatively distinct regulatory pathways in RV compared to LV. Data mining of nearly three thousand RV-enriched genes under PAC disclosed novel potential (co)-regulators of long-term RV remodeling and hypertrophy. We reason that specific inhibitory mechanisms in RV restrict excessive myocardial hypertrophy and thereby contribute to its vulnerability to pressure overload.

It is elicited by sodium deficiency, stress-evoked ACTH and by reproduction. Genome-wide microarrays in sodium deficient mice, or following ACTH infusion, showed upregulation of hypothalamic genes, including DARPP-32, dopamine receptors-1 and  -2, alpha-2C-adrenoceptor, and STEP. Both DARPP-32 and neural plasticity regulator, ARC were upregulated in lateral hypothalamic orexinergic neurons by sodium deficiency. Administration of dopamine D1- (SCH23390) and D2-receptor (raclopride) antagonists  reduced gratification of sodium appetite triggered by sodium  deficiency. SCH23390 was specific, having no effect on  osmotic-induced water drinking, whereas raclopride also reduced  water intake. D1-receptor knockout mice had normal sodium appetite, indicating compensatory regulation. It was  insensitive to SCH23390, confirming the absence of off-target effects. Bilateral microinjection of SCH23390 (100nM in 200nL) into rats? lateral hypothalamus greatly reduced sodium appetite. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis  in  hypothalami of mice with sodium appetite showed significant enrichment of gene sets previously linked to addiction (opiates, cocaine). This finding of concerted gene regulation was attenuated upon gratification with perplexingly rapid kinetics of only 10 minutes, anteceding significant absorption of salt from the gut.  Salt appetite and hedonic liking of salt taste have evolved over more than  a  hundred million years e.g. being present in Metatheria. Drugs causing pleasure and addiction are comparatively recent and likely reflect usurping of evolutionary ancient systems with high survival value by the gratification of contemporary hedonic indulgences.  Our findings outline a novel molecular logic for instinctive behavior encoded by the brain with  possible  important translational-medical implications. Transcripts were profiled in the hypothalamus and whole brain of control and salt craving animals to determine the gene expression profile corresponding to that behavioral state.

Msgn1 is a bHLH transcription factor and is a direct target gene of the Wnt/bcatenin signaling pathway. Msgn1 is expressed in the mesodermal compartment of the primitive streak and is necessary for the proper development of the mesoderm. Msgn1 mutants show defects in somitogenesis leading to a lack of trunk skeletal muscles, vertebra and ribs. To study the molecular and cellular function of Msgn1 in Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC), we have generated doxycycline inducible gain-of-function ESC to overexpress Msgn1 in ESC. In order to identify Msgn1 targets, we performed transcriptional profiling of Msgn1 expressing ES cells and found that upon induction of Msgn1, multiple genes in the Notch pathway were differentially expressed compared to the uninduced cells. Moreover, Whole Mount Insitu Hybridization analysis in Msgn1 null mutants revealed that these Notch pathway genes required Msgn1 for their proper expression in vivo. Our studies demonstrate that Msgn1 is a critical effector of the Wnt pathway during mammalian somitogenesis, mediating crosstalk between the Wnt and Notch pathways. Inducible A2lox-Flag Msgn1 ES cells were differentiated to form Embryoid bodies (EBs) for 2 days. Flag-Msgn1 was induced on day 2 with doxycycline and samples were collected at three time points, 12h, 24h and 48h after addition of doxycycline. Uninduced cells were used as controls.

Samples were collected at 12h interval up to 48h. Using this protocol, the expression of endogenous markers of the PSM lineage initiate on day 3 of in vitro differentiation. Thus induction of F-Msgn1 expression after 2 days of differentiation results in premature, ectopic Msgn1 expression.;

They are about 22 nucleotides long and are involved in silencing of mRNA through sequence specific binding to the 3    untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA subsequently causing translational repression and/or will promote the degradation of protein-coding mRNA. Specifically, the miRNA family, mir-146 a/b, has been previously found to be involved in the regulation of the innate immune response by functioning as a negative regulator to help fine-tune the immune response.   Microglial cells are the macrophage of the brain participating as major players of the innate immune response. During prion disease, no immune response is mounted against PrPSc possibly due to its similarity to host PrPc and thus, the host immune response would be suppressed and tightly regulated. Therefore, an increased expression of mir-146 by microglial cells during prion disease may function as one of these negative regulators.      Our objective of this experiment is to use DNA microarrays to investigate the gene regulation of mir-146 previously found upregulated in our studies of mouse brain tissue specifically in microglial cells during prion disease with the aim of having a better understanding of prion pathobiology and a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Mir-146 expression was confirmed via in situ analysis of brain tissue and was further investigated in a microglial murine cell line (EOC 13.31). To mimic mir-146 upregulation during prion disease, mir-146 a & b were overexpressed in EOCs using a lipid based reverse transfection system. Furthermore, endogeneous mir-146 was knocked down as another method to help confirm the mRNA targets affected by mir-146. Simultaneously, another experiment was performed for the investigation of its involvement in the innate immune response by stimulating the EOCs with differing concentrations of LPS from E.coli (055:B5). Total RNA was collected and prepared at several timepoints and the levels of expression of both mir-146 a & b was tested via qRT-PCR. The RNA collected from the EOCs from each condition were used as target material for dual-color, competitive hybridization to Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K oligo arrays. All the significant targets found on the mircorarrays were compared against the various conditions to find a consensus of affected mir-146 mRNA targets. ..

To systematically analyze miRNA expression in neurons, we have established a miRNA tagging and affinity purification (miRAP) method that is targeted to cell types through the Cre-loxP binary system in mice. Our studies of the neocortex and cerebellum reveal the expression of a large fraction of known miRNAs with distinct profiles in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and subtypes of GABAergic neurons.  We further detected putative novel miRNAs, tissue or cell type-specific strand selection of miRNAs, and miRNA editing.  Our method thus will facilitate a systematic analysis of miRNA expression and regulation in specific neuron types in the context of neuronal development, physiology, plasticity, pathology and disease models, and is generally applicable to other cell types and tissues.

How H3K27me3 governs adult SCs and tissue development is unclear. Here, we conditionally target H3-K27-methyltransferases Ezh2 and Ezh1 to address their roles in mouse skin homeostasis. Postnatal phenotypes appear only in doubly-targeted skin, where H3K27me3 is abolished, revealing functional redundancy in EZH1/2 proteins. Surprisingly, while Ezh1/2-null hair follicles (HFs) arrest morphogenesis and degenerate due to defective proliferation and increased apoptosis, epidermis hyperproliferates and survives engraftment. mRNA-microarray studies reveal that despite these striking phenotypic differences, similar genes are upregulated in HF and epidermal Ezh1/2-null progenitors. Featured prominently are a) PcG-controlled non-skin lineage genes, whose expression is still significantly lower than in native tissues, and b) the PcG-regulated Ink4a/Inkb/Arf locus. Interestingly, even though Ink4a/Arf/Ink4b genes are fully activated in HF cells, they only partially so in epidermal-progenitors. Importantly, transduction of Ink4b/Ink4a/Arf shRNAs restores proliferation/survival of Ezh1/2-null HF progenitors in vitro, pointing towards the relevance of this locus to the observed HF phenotypes. Our findings reveal new insights into Polycomb-dependent tissue control and provide a new twist to how different progenitors within one tissue respond to loss of H3K27me3. RNAs from FACS-purified WT and Ezh1/2 2KO ORS, matrix and epidermal cells (Rendl et al., 2005) were provided to the Genomics Core Facility, MSKCC for quality control, quantification, reverse transcription, labeling and hybridization to MOE430A 2.0 microarray chips (Affymetrix).

We found that feeder cells provide a relatively low concentration (25 unit/ml) of LIF, which is insufficient to maintain the ESC/iPSC pluripotency in feeder free conditions. In order to identify additional factors involved in the maintenance of pluripotency, we carried out a global transcript expression profiling of mouse iPSC cultured on feeder cells and in feeder-free (LIF-treated) conditions. This identified 17 significantly differentially expressed genes (adjusted p-value<0.05) including 7 chemokines over-expressed in iPSC grown on feeder cells. Ectopic expression of these chemokines in iPSC revealed that CC chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) induced the key transcription factor genes for pluripotency, Klf4, Nanog, Sox2 and Tbx3. Further, addition of recombinant Ccl2 protein drastically increased the number of Nanog-GFP-positive iPSC grown in low LIF feeder free conditions. Interestingly, this effect was not observed in the absence of LIF. We further revealed that pluripotency promotion by Ccl2 is mediated by activating the Stat3-pathway followed by Klf4 up-regulation. We demonstrated that Ccl2 mediated increased pluripotency is independent of PI3K and MAPK pathways and that Tbx3 may be directly up-regulated by Klf4. Overall, Ccl2 cooperatively activates the Stat3-pathway with LIF in feeder free condition to maintain pluripotency for ESC/iPSC. Total RNAs were purified from feeder cells (as a reference sample), iPSC grown on feeder cells and iPSC grown in feeder-free condition in triplicates and applied to the arrays. iPSC grown on feeder cells were separated mechanically from the feeder layer to minimize feeder cell contamination. ..

To that end, we established a genetically homogenous secondary reprogramming system, in which mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying doxycycline (dox)-inducible lentiviruses expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc were isolated and used as donors for different reprogramming experiments. We generated iPSCs after plating MEFs in the presence of dox in ES culture conditions, and then derived ntESCs after transplantation of the nucleus from the same MEFs into enucleated oocyte.

We developed three human lung adenocarcinoma murine models of resistance to the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab and, using species-specific profiling, separately investigated tumor cell and stromal molecules associated with resistance. Gene expression changes associated with acquired resistance occurred predominantly in stromal (mouse) and not tumor (human) cells. Components of the EGFR and FGFR2 pathways were significantly upregulated in stroma, but not in tumor cells. Increased activated EGFR was detected on pericytes of xenografts that acquired resistance and on endothelium of tumors with relative primary resistance. Acquired resistance was associated with a pattern of pericyte-covered, normalized revascularization, whereas tortuous, uncovered vessels were observed in relative primary resistance. Dual targeting of VEGF and EGFR pathways with bevacizumab and erlotinib, or the VEGFR/EGFR inhibitor vandetanib, reduced pericyte coverage and increased progression-free survival. These findings demonstrate that alterations in tumor stromal pathways, including EGFR and FGFR2, are associated with, and may contribute to VEGF inhibitor resistance and that targeting these pathways may improve therapeutic efficacy. Understanding stromal signaling may be critical for developing biomarkers for angiogenesis inhibitors and improving combination regimens. To identify changes in stromal and tumor gene expression associated with acquired resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, we performed RNA microarray analyses comparing H1975 control (vehicle-treated) and BV-resistant (bevacizumab-treated until progression) xenografts (n=3 biologic replicates per group of treatment) using Illumina mouse (WG-6 v2) and human (WG-6 v3)-specific expression arrays.

In animals such as the frog, Xenopus laevis, programmed transcript regionalization directs early embryonic axis formation and is essential for normal development. However, it is unknown whether such transcriptome asymmetry directs embryogenesis in mammals, or indeed, whether it occurs at all. We here address this by transcript profiling of matching sub-cellular structures and single cells in mouse oocytes and early embryos and analytical strategies exploiting the paired data structure. Spindle samples contained a set of transcripts that was distinguishable from that of the unfertilized metaphase II (mII) oocytes from which each spindle was microsurgically dissected. Immediately following fertilization, cytokinesis produces a 1-cell embryo (zygote) and associated spindle-enriched second polar body (Pb2) whose transcript profiles also differed one from the other, partially reflecting the enrichment of spindle-associated transcripts. Non-uniform transcript distribution within zygotes did not lead to programmed transcriptome asymmetry between the blastomeres of nascent two-cell embryos, or between the second mitotic products of 3-cell embryos. These findings suggest that mammalian oocytes and zygotes exhibit transcript regionalization without subsequent transcriptome asymmetries between respective early mitotic products. This contrasts the situation in Xenopus and places constraints on the ability of maternal transcriptomic prepatterning to prescribe early mammalian development. 16 Zygote vs. Polar body pairs, 10 spindle vs. oocyte pairs, 22 2-cell embryos and 8 3-cell embryos were analysed.Although the raw data are two channel, only the Cy5 signal of each file was analyzed.

The histone H3K9 methyltransferase KMT1E, formerly known as ESET or Setdb1, is essential to embryonic development as the ablation of the Setdb1 gene results in peri-implantation lethality and prevents the propagation of ES cells. However, Setdb1- null blastocysts do not display global changes in H3K9 methylation or DNA methylation, arguing against a genome- wide defect. Here we show that conditional deletion of the Setdb1 gene in ES cells results in the upregulation of lineage differentiation markers, especially trophectoderm-specific factors, similar to effects observed upon loss of Oct3/4 expression in ES cells. We demonstrate that KMT1E deficiency in ES cells leads to a decrease in histone H3K9 methylation at and derepression of trophoblast-associated genes such as Cdx2. Furthermore, we find genes that are derepressed upon Setdb1 deletion to overlap with known targets of polycomb mediated repression, suggesting that KMT1E mediated H3K9 methylation acts in concert with polycomb controlled H3K27 methylation. Our studies thus demonstrate an essential role for KMT1E in the control of developmentally regulated gene expression programs in ES cells.

This X chromosome inactivation phenomenon is triggered by Xist gene, which is essential for X-inactivation to occur in cis. We demonstrate that an Xist mutant, XistIVS, is unique in that it retains a partial function to silence the X chromosome, which would provide an opportunity to dissect the molecular mechanism of Xist RNA-mediated chromosome silencing. To study the effect of XistIVS mutation on silencing of X-linked genes, global expression levels of X-linked genes were measured in mutant and control cells.

Recent demonstration that members of the Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family proteins can convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) raised the possibility that Tet proteins are capable of establishing a distinct epigenetic state. We have recently demonstrated that Tet1 is specifically expressed in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells and is required for ES cell self-renewal and maintenance. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), here we show that Tet1 is preferentially bound to CpG-rich sequences at promoters of both transcriptionally active and Polycomb-repressed genes. Despite a general increase in levels of DNA methylation at Tet1 binding-sites, Tet1 depletion does not lead to down-regulation of all the Tet1 targets. Interestingly, while Tet1-mediated promoter hypomethylation is required for maintaining the expression of a group of transcriptionally active genes, it is also required for repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators. Tet1 contributes to silencing of this group of genes by facilitating recruitment of PRC2 to CpG-rich gene promoters. Thus, our study not only establishes a role for Tet1 in modulating DNA methylation levels at CpG-rich promoters, but also reveals a dual function of Tet1 in promoting transcription of pluripotency factors as well as participating in the repression of Polycomb-targeted developmental regulators. Mouse ES cells infected with control knockdown (KD) or Tet1 KD  lentiviruses  were FACS-sorted for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.  We also investigated the effect of Nanog overexpression (OE) in Tet1 KD mouse ES cells on dys-regulated Tet1 targets. We have collected four biologically independent replicates for each treatment. .. mouse ES cells;  Tet1;  control;  total RNA;  Nanog;  none;  Tet1 KD + Nanog OE mouse ES cells;  Tet1 KD mouse ES cells;  control KD mouse ES cells;  E14Tg2A;  10090;  Mus musculus;  For Tet1 knockdown (KD), mouse ES cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing both the GFP reporter and short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) specific for Tet1. All analyses were performed using  Tet1-depleted ES cells that were purified on the basis of GFP fluorescence by FACS 8 days after lentiviral transduction. Lentiviruses expressing GFP alone was used as a control. Short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences were cloned into pTY vector under the control of the U6 promoter. To rescue Tet1 knockdown with Nanog, complementary DNA of Nanog was placed downstream of the puromycin-resistant gene and foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A segment.;

CBFb-SMMHC, a fusion protein in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), dominantly inhibits RUNX1 largely through its RUNX1 high-affinity binding domain (HABD). We generated knock-in mice expressing CBFb-SMMHC with a HABD deletion, CBFb-SMMHCd179-221. These mice developed leukemia highly efficiently, even though hematopoietic defects associated with Runx1-inhibition were partially rescued. To identify changes in gene expression with the deletion of the HABD, we compared the gene expression profile in leukemia samples from mice expressing CBFb-SMMHCd179-221 with those from mice expressing full length CBFb-SMMHC. Spleen cells were isolated from leukemic knock-in mice with full length CBFb-SMMHC at 2 months after ENU treatment and 2 leukemic CBFb-SMMHCd179-221 expressing chimeric mice at 3 weeks after birth.

Cre-mediated stabilization of   -catenin in the ureteric cell lineage prior to the onset of kidney development increased   -catenin levels and caused renal aplasia or severe hypodysplasia. A genome-wide analysis of mRNA expression in dysplastic tissue identified down-regulation of genes required for ureteric branching and up regulation of Tgf  2 and Dkk1.  Hoxb7-Cre:EGFP mice ( Zhao, et al. (2004) Dev Biol 276:403-415) were crossed with mice containing loxP sites flanking exon 3 of the   -catenin allele (  -catdelta3/delta3) (Harada,et al.

Traditionally, keratinocytes have been considered as an inert component of the multilayered epithelium to protect the subepithelial compartments from the pathogenic microorganisms, toxic stimuli and physical trauma. However, accumulated researches of the airway, gastrointestinal tract and skin have demonstrated that keratinocytes function in the development of the immune system, promotion of pathologic inflammation and even impose diverse decisions on immune cells. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of oral keratinocyte during oral adaptive immune response.

Subsequently, the epithelial layer was enzymatically and mechanically separated from the underlying connective tissue and was further incubated in 0.25% Trypsin/0.02% EDTA (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) for 3-5 min with vigorous pipetting to achieve cell dispersion. After trypsin was inactivated by 10% fetal bovine and washing, the cell suspension was re-suspended in PBS to the concentration of 1?107 cells/ml. After being intraperitoneally anesthesized with chloral hydrate, C57BL/6J mice were given a subcutaneous injection with 50 ?l cell suspension obtained from BALB/c mice into the foreneck. Seven days later, 25?l cell suspension was injected to the same C57BL/6J mouse into tongue submucosa under anesthesia. Groups of six C57BL/6J mice at 48h and 96h after tongue submucosal injection and control without any manipulation were sacrificed. Tongues were excised and subcutaneous tissue and blood were trimmed.

Use of massively parallel sequencing and splicing-sensitive junction arrays revealed that levels of 601 mRNAs are changed (including Fus/Tls, progranulin, and other transcripts encoding neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins) and 965 altered splicing events are detected (including in sortilin, the receptor for progranulin), following depletion of TDP-43 from adult brain with antisense oligonucleotides. RNAs whose levels are most depleted by reduction in TDP-43 are derived from genes with very long introns and which encode proteins involved in synaptic activity. Lastly, TDP-43 was found to auto-regulate its synthesis, in part by directly binding and enhancing splicing of an intron within the 3    untranslated region of its own transcript, thereby triggering nonsense mediated RNA degradation.

A number of studies have demonstrated that neural proteoglycans are involved structural organization of the striatum and formation of dopaminergic connections to and from the striatum. Several proteoglycans are also associated with neuronal regeneration and some have been shown to be components of filamentous inclusions found in neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, the localization and proper function of dopamine receptors, which are predominantly expressed in the striatum, are governed by N-linked glycosylation events. Huntington  s Disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, results in selective degeneration of the striatum. This is caused by a mutation in the protein, huntingtin, however, the mechanisms responsible for neuronal degeneration remain unknown. Similar to the brains of HD patients, HD transgenic mice exhibit huntingtin protein aggregation and nuclear inclusions, selective degeneration of dopamine neurons in the striatum and dopamine receptor dysfunction. In this study, the gene expression patterns of HD transgenic mice were analyzed. Four groups, pre-symptomatic HD mice (6 weeks old), WT control (6 weeks), post symptomatic HD (16 weeks), and WT control (16 weeks), were hybridized and analyzed using the GLYCOv2 array.

C57BL/6NCrl mice showed persistent inter-individual variation of ethanol intake in a two-bottle choice paradigm over a three week period, ranging from less than 1 g/kg to over 14 g/kg ethanol in an 18h interval. Whole genome microarray expression analysis in nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area of individual animals identified gene expression patterns correlated with ethanol intake.  Results included several gene networks previously implicated in ethanol behaviors, such as glutamate signaling, BDNF and genes involved in synaptic vesicle function.  Additionally, genes functioning in epigenetic chromatin or DNA modifications such as acetylation and/or methylation also had expression patterns correlated with ethanol intake.  Our results thus implicate specific brain regional gene networks, including chromatin modification factors, as potentially important mechanisms underlying individual variation in ethanol intake. Voluntary two-bottle choice drinking was performed as described previously (Khisti et al. 2006).  Briefly, two bottles containing 10%(w/v) ethanol (Aaper Alcohol and Chemical Co.

Evidence for expression differences and loss of the variants ability to metastasize to the lung could have clinical implications in the prevention of metastasis to different organs. The 4T1 mouse metastatic breast cancer cell line is known to change with passages in culture. Our data has shown changes cause the cells to metastasize to the intestine rather than to the lung.

Hoxa9 is expressed in early hematopoietic progenitor cells and promotes stem cell expansion. In contrast Hoxa9 down regulation is associated with hematopoietic differentiation. In addition to its role in development, HOXA9 has been intensively studied because of its central role in human acute leukemias. Despite their obvious biomedical importance, the mechanisms through which Hoxa9 and its partner proteins exert their downstream functions are poorly understood. Using whole-genome gene expression profiling, we identified direct targets of Hoxa9 in murine MHPs after 4-OHT withdraw, resulting in cell differentiation.

Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of MSCs to attenuate inflammation in rodent models of acute lung injury (ALI) suggesting that MSCs may also be beneficial in treating ALI. To better understand how human MSCs (hMSCs) may act in ALI, the lungs of immunocompetent mice were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 4 hr later bone marrow derived hMSCS were delivered by oropharyngeal aspiration (OA). Administration of hMSCs significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil counts and total protein in bronchoalveolar lavage. There was a concomitant reduction in pulmonary edema as indicated by a decrease in lung wet/dry weight ratio. The anti-inflammatory effects of hMSCs were not dependent on localization to the lung, as intraperitoneal administration of hMSCs also attenuated LPS-induced inflammation in the lung. Microarray analysis revealed significant induction of TNF-  -induced protein 6 (TSG-6) expression by hMSCs 12 hr after OA delivery to LPS-exposed lungs. Knockdown of TSG-6 expression in hMSCs by RNA interference abrogated most of their anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, intra-pulmonary delivery of recombinant human TSG-6 reduced LPS-induced inflammation in the lung. These results show that hMSCs recapitulate the observed beneficial effects of rodent MSCs in animal models of ALI and suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of hMSCs in the lung are explained, at least in part, by activation of hMSCs to secrete TSG-6. Eight- to 10-week-old female BALB/C mice were treated with either 1 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in 100   l PBS or an equal volume of PBS, as vehicle control, by oropharyngeal aspiration (OA). Four hours after LPS exposure, 250,000 human multipotent stromal cells in 100   l of PBS were given by OA and 30 min later a second dose of equal concentration was administered, for a total of 500,000 hMSC. As a control, 200   l PBS was delivered as described above. After 12 h, total RNA was isolated from (A) lungs of LPS-exposed mice treated with either hMSCs (LPS+MSC) or PBS (LPS+PBS), and (B) lungs of PBS-exposed mice treated with hMSCs (PBS+MSC). To obtain additional controls, hMSCs were mixed in vitro with either LPS- (LPS+MSC in vitro mix) or PBS-exposed (PBS+MSC in vitro mix) mouse lungs just before RNA isolation.

This miniaturization may be related to loss of hair follicle stem or progenitor cells. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed bald and non-bald scalp from the same individuals for the presence of hair follicle stem and progenitor cells using flow cytometry to quantitate cells expressing CYTOKERATIN 15 (KRT15), CD200, CD34 and ALPHA-6-INTEGRIN (ITGA6). High levels of KRT15 expression correlated with stem cell properties of small cell size and quiescence. Cells with the highest level of KRT15 expression were maintained in bald scalp; however, distinct populations of CD200high ITGA6high cells and CD34-positive cells were markedly diminished. Consistent with a progenitor cell phenotype, the diminished populations localized closely to the stem-cell rich bulge area but were larger and more proliferative than the bulge stem cells. In functional assays, analogous CD200 high /Itga6 high cells from murine hair follicles were multipotent and generated new hair follicles in skin reconstitution assays. These findings suggest that a defect in stem cell activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of AGA. 4 independent biologic replicates  (each pooled from 3 distinct mice) were sorted for Mouse bulge (CD34+CD200+CD49+) versus secondary hair germ (CD34-CD200+CD49+) versus interfollicular epidermis (CD34-CD200-CD49+) .. 50 days;  telogen;  total RNA;  female;  CD34+CD200+CD49+;  CD34-CD200+CD49+;  CD34-CD200-CD49+;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Back Skin;  Cells were not treated;

The sterol-responsive element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors regulating expression of genes controlling lipid homeostasis in many tissues. To identify the role of SREBPs in the lung, we conditionally deleted the SREBP cleavage-activating protein gene, Scap, in respiratory epithelial cells (Scap   /   ) in vivo. Prior to birth (E18.5), deletion of Scap decreased the expression of both SREBPs and a number of genes regulating fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. Nevertheless, Scap   /    mice survived postnatally, surfactant and lung tissue lipids being substantially normalized in adult Scap   /    mice. Although phospholipid synthesis was decreased in type II cells from adult Scap   /    mice, lipid storage, synthesis, and transfer by lung lipofibroblasts were increased. mRNA microarray data indicated that SCAP influenced two major gene networks, one regulating lipid metabolism and the other stress-related responses. Deletion of the SCAP/SREBP pathway in respiratory epithelial cells altered lung lipid homeostasis and induced compensatory lipid accumulation and synthesis in lung lipofibroblasts. To identify the role of SREBPs in the lung, we conditionally deleted the SREBP cleavage-activating protein gene, Scap, in respiratory epithelial cells (Scap   /   ) in vivo.Lung cRNA was hybridized to the murine genome MOE430 V2 chips. ..

For virulence, L. pneumophila requires a Dot/Icm type IV secretion system that translocates bacterial effectors to the host cytosol.  L. pneumophila lacking the Dot/Icm system is recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to a canonical NF-  B-dependent transcriptional response.  In addition, L. pneumophila expressing a functional Dot/Icm system potently induces unique transcriptional targets, including proinflammatory genes such as Il23a and Csf2. Here we demonstrate that this Dot/Icm-dependent response, which we term the effector-triggered response (ETR), requires five translocated bacterial effectors that inhibit host protein synthesis.  Upon infection of macrophages with virulent L. pneumophila, these five effectors caused a global decrease in host translation, thereby preventing synthesis of I  B, an inhibitor of the NF-  B transcription factor.  Thus, macrophages infected with wildtype L. pneumophila exhibited prolonged activation of NF-  B, which was associated with transcription of ETR target genes such as Il23a and Csf2.  L. pneumophila mutants lacking the five effectors still activated TLRs and NF-  B, but because the mutants permitted normal I  B synthesis, NF-  B activation was more transient and was not sufficient to fully induce the ETR.  L. pneumophila mutants expressing enzymatically inactive effectors were also unable to fully induce the ETR, whereas multiple compounds or bacterial toxins that inhibit host protein synthesis via distinct mechanisms recapitulated the ETR when administered with TLR ligands. Previous studies have demonstrated that the host response to bacterial infection is induced primarily by specific microbial molecules that activate TLRs or cytosolic pattern recognition receptors. Our results add to this model by providing a striking illustration of how the host immune response to a virulent pathogen can also be shaped by pathogen-encoded activities, such as inhibition of host protein synthesis. Four-condition experiment: macrophages left uninfected (negative control), or infected with wildtype Legionella pneumophila, the flagellin-deficient mutant   flaA, or the secretion-deficient mutant   dotA (three experimental conditions).

As a result, it is possible that regulatory T cells and pathogenic T cells may display a different set of gene profile regulating their functional status. To identify genes contributing to the functional role of T cells, we used microarrays to examine the global gene expression in regulatory T cells, pathogenic T cells, and control non-regulatory, non-pathogenic T cells.

Here we show that Prdm14 safeguards mouse ESC maintenance by preventing induction of extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn) fates. Conversely, Prdm14 overexpression impairs ExEn differentiation during embryoid body (EB) formation. Prdm14 occupies and represses genomic loci encoding ExEn differentiation factors, while also binding to and promoting expression of genes associated with ESC self-renewal. Prdm14-bound genomic regions significantly overlap those occupied by Nanog and Oct4, are enriched in a chromatin signature associated with distal regulatory elements, and contain a unique DNA-sequence motif recognized by Prdm14 in vitro. Our work identifies Prdm14 as a new member of mouse ESC (mESC) transcriptional network, which plays a dual role as a context-dependent transcriptional repressor or activator at distal silencers and enhancers. [ChIP-seq] Genome-wide mapping of Prdm14 binding sites in mouse embryonic stem cells:A FLAG-HA tagged Prdm14 (FH-Prdm14) mESC line was established.

ECM is characterised by high levels of parasite sequestration and recruitment of pathogenic CD8+ T cells to the brain. The role of CD4+ T cells in this model has not yet been fully elucidated, although our laboratory has recently shown that CD4+ T cell depletion prior to infection results in significantly lower parasite burdens and protection from ECM. These data highlight a pathogenic role for CD4+ T cells in ECM. Our unpublished observations indicate that mice lacking the CD8+ T cell cytolytic effector molecule, Granzyme B, (GzmB), are resistant to ECM, showing markedly reduced parasite burdens. Late depletion of CD4+ T cells from PbA-infected GzmB-deficient mice results in enhanced parasite burdens, indicating that these cells may play an anti-parasitic role. In the present study, we have analysed splenic CD4+ T cell gene expression profiles in na  ve C57BL/6 mice, and PbA-infected wild-type and GzmB-deficent mice to further our understanding of the CD4+ T cell response in ECM.
