To investigate the age-dependent molecular changes in a mouse model, we compared the expression profiles of metaphase II oocytes collected from 5-6 week old mice with those collected from 40-42 week old mice using the NIA 22K 60-mer oligo microarray.

Ts65Dn mice have segmental trisomy of mouse chromosome 16 with ca. 128 genes at dosage imbalance (Reeves et al. 1995). The Ts65Dn mouse is widely used as a model for studies of DS because it is at dosage imbalance for the orthologs of about half the 284 Chr21 genes. Ts65Dn mice have several features that directly parallel developmental anomalies of DS. We compare here the expression of 136 mouse orthologs of Chr21 genes, 77 of which are triplicated in Ts65Dn, in trisomic and euploid mice.   We designed a mouse cDNA expression array interrogating 136 mmu21 genes.  RNA pools from four adult male Ts65Dn mice and four male euploid littermates were prepared from cortex and dissected from three to four month-old mice. Directly labeled first strand cDNA probes from nine different tissues were hybridized to the arrays in replicated hybridizations. A total of 446 genes that are not triplicated in Ts65Dn mice served as controls.  These included 62 mmu21 genes from MMU10, MMU17, and non-triplicated portions of MMU16, plus 384 randomly distributed mouse cDNAs from the Unigene collection.

This generates a time course showing the activation of genes on the array across the first wave of spermatogenesis, which can then be correlated with the appearance of specific germ cell types, allowing assignation of unknown genes to differing cell types and charting the evolution of the developing testis transcriptome.  Adult testis RNA from six different genetic models of infertility (XXSxrb, mshi, Bax -/-, bs, Bcl-w -/- and azh) were compared to age- and strain-matched normal control testis RNA.  These models possess different cellular complements within the testis, which can be interpreted within the framework established by the first wave analysis and used to refine the assignment of genes to cell type.

Samples were collected at twelve time points from the germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocyte to the late (expanded) blastocyst.
Yes|E-MEXP-73|Done|Baseline|transcription profiling by array|2018-04-06|203|2120|Transcription profiling of global gene expression changes during mouse preimplantation development: unfertilized eggs, fertilized egg, 2-cell embryos, 4-cell embryos, 8-cell embryos, morulae, blastocysts|Microarray data analysis Intensity of 21,939 gene features per array was extracted from scanned microarray images using Feature Extraction 5.1.1 software (Agilent Technologies), which performs background subtractions and dye normalization. This normalization method is targeted at detecting changes in relative expression of individual genes rather than global expression. Global expression change would require external normalization controls (van de Peppel et al., 2003). Text output was processed using an application developed in-house to perform ANOVA analysis (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/ANOVA/). Intensity of features measured with a >50% error were replaced with missing values except features with very low intensity. Surrogate values equal to mean error were inserted for values that were negative or less than the probe error. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with embryonic stage as a factor. The small number of biological replications typical in expression profiling experiments results in a highly variable error variance, and this problem is usually addressed by log-ratio thresholds (Schena et al., 1995) that require subjective decisions about biological significance, or by Bayesian adjustment of error variance (Baldi and Long, 2001), which may still underestimate error variance and result in false positive results. To reduce false-positives, we opted for a very conservative error model in which error variance that is used for estimating F-statistics is the maximum of the actual error variance for this gene and the average error variance in 500 genes with similar average intensity. Statistical significance was determined using the False Discovery Rate (FDR = 10%) method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Pair-wise mean comparison was done with t-statistics and FDR=10%. Further data processing including scatter plots, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) were also performed through NIA microarray analysis tool (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/ANOVA/).  The input file for NIA microarray analysis tool is available at http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/microarray/data.html

Previous studies have shown that the foxA1 null mouse demonstrates severe postnatal growth retardation followed by death between P2 and P12. These mutant mice are hypoglycemic despite unchanged expression of foxA1 target genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis. foxA1 is known to bind to and transactivate the proglucagon gene promoter and mice null for this gene have a 70% reduction in pancreatic proglucagon gene expression and plasma glucagon levels are reduced markedly.

This work aims to demonstrate a key role for the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in liver embryonic growth and in controlling the fate of hepatoblasts, preventing them to differentiate towards the hepatocyte lineage, and guiding them to a duct morphogenesis. Through the inactivation of Apc (adenomatous Polyposis Coli) tumor suppressor gene in hepatoblasts by a Cre-loxP strategy, the ectopic activation of beta-catenin targeted in hepatoblasts after liver bud formation leads to a lethal embryonic phenotype, characterized by liver hypoplasia, a blockade of hepatocyte differentiation and commitment to a biliary fate.

MECP2 mutations in females lead to Rett syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by developmental stagnation and regression, loss of purposeful hand use and speech, stereotypic hand movements, deceleration of brain growth, autonomic dysfunction and seizures. Most mutations occur de novo during spermatogenesis. Located at Xq28, MECP2 is subject to X inactivation, and affected females are mosaic. Rare hemizygous males suffer from a severe congenital encephalopathy.  Methods  To identify pathways mis-regulated by MeCP2 deficiency, microarray-based global gene expression studies were carried out on cerebellum of Mecp2 mutant mice. We compared transcript levels in mutant/wildtype male sibs of two different MeCP2-deficient mouse models at 2, 4 and 8 weeks of age. Increased transcript levels were evaluated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to document in vivo MeCP2 binding to promoter regions of candidate target genes.  Results  In the mutants, several hundred genes showed altered expression levels. Twice as many were increased than decreased, and only 27 genes were differentially expressed at more than one time point. The number of misregulated genes was 30% lower in mice with an exon 3 deletion (Mecp2tm1.1Jae) than in mice with a larger deletion (Mecp2tm1.1Bird). Between the mutants, few misregulated genes overlapped at each time point. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays validated increased transcript levels for four genes: Irak1, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1; Fxyd1, phospholemman, associated with Na, K-ATPase; Reln, encoding reelin, an extracellular signaling molecule essential for neuronal lamination and synaptic plasticity; and Gtl2/Meg3, an imprinted maternally expressed non-translated RNA that serves as a host gene for C/D box snoRNAs and microRNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays documented in vivo MeCP2 binding to promoter regions of Fxyd1, Reln, and Gtl2.  Conclusions  Transcriptional profiling of cerebellum failed to detect significant global changes in Mecp2-mutant mice. Increased transcript levels of Irak1, Fxyd1, Reln, and Gtl2 may contribute to the neuronal dysfunction in MeCP2-deficient mice and individuals with Rett syndrome. Our data provide testable hypotheses for future studies of the regulatory or signaling pathways that these genes act on.

This was accomplished by comparing expression profiles of embryonic dorsal pancreas tissue from Ngn3 null mice with wild-type littermates at days 13 and 15 of embryonic development. The comparison of gene expression in mutant and wild-type pancreas was used primarily to show genes that are lower expressed/missing in the mutant, as Ngn3 null mice have no endocrine pancreas tissue. From each developmental stage, five wild-type and five mutant samples were chosen, representing embryos from at least three different litters. Wild-type and mutant samples from the common stage of development were paired randomly and analysed in flipped colour. Probes were spotted in duplicate on each slide in a randomised (fixed) layout, effectively distributing the duplicate spots randomly over the slide.

To test whether these pertubrations were reflected in the adult tissues' gene expression programs, we compared the gene expression profile of E2F4 double knockout mice to the gene expression found in identical tissues from E2F4 heterozygous littermates, that are phenotypically normal.  We selected liver, testes, and kidney to profile by gene expression analysis, because two of these tissues are affected at some point during development when E2F4 is missing.

We show here that, while hepatocytes lacking PGC-1alpha; are defective in the program of hormone-stimulated gluconeogenesis, the mice have constitutively activated gluconeogenic gene expression that is completely insensitive to normal feeding controls. C/EBPbeta; is elevated in the livers of these mice and activates the gluconeogenic genes in a PGC-1  -independent manner. Despite having reduced mitochondrial function, PGC-1alpha; null mice are paradoxically lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity. This is largely due to a profound hyperactivity displayed by the null animals and is associated with lesions in the striatal region of the brain that controls movement. These data illustrate a central role for PGC-1alpha; in the control of energy metabolism but also reveal novel systemic compensatory mechanisms and pathogenic effects of impaired energy homeostasis.

The most frequent form of MODY is caused by mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1a (HNF-1a, TCF1). Mutant mice with loss of Tcf1 function as well as transgenic mice expressing a naturally occurring dominant-negative form of human TCF1(P291fsinsC) in pancreatic beta cells develop progressive hyperglycemia due to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Hagenfeldt-Johansson et al., 2001; Yamagata et al., 2002).  Importantly, these mice exhibit a progressive reduction in beta cell number, proliferation rate, and pancreatic insulin content.  These data indicate that Tcf-1 target genes are also required for maintenance of normal beta cell mass.  In this study we sought to identify target genes of Tcf-1 that may be responsible of mediating beta cell growth by comparing gene expression profiles of Tcf-1 knock-out and wild-type littermates in isolated pancreatic islets.
Yes|E-TABM-223|Done|WT vs. Mutant|transcription profiling by array|2017-09-26|82|1219|Transcription profiling of pituitary glands from wild type and LSD1 knock-out mice|Precise control of transcriptional programs underlying metazoan development is modulated by enzymatically active co-regulatory complexes, coupled with epigenetic strategies, but how specific members of histone modification enzyme families such as histone methyltransferases and demethylases are utilized in vivo to simultaneously orchestrate distinct developmental gene activation and repression programs remains unclear. Here, we report that the initially-described histone lysine demethylase, LSD1, a component of the CoREST/CtBP corepressor complex, is required for late cell-lineage determination and differentiation during pituitary organogenesis. Surprisingly, LSD1 acts primarily on target gene activation programs, as well as in gene repression programs, based on recruitment of distinct LSD1-containing coactivator or corepressor complexes. Intriguingly, LSD1-dependent gene repression programs can be extended late in development with the induced expression of ZEB1, a Kr.pple-like repressor that can act as a molecular beacon for recruitment of the LSD1-containing CtBP/CoREST corepressor complex, causing repression of an additional cohort of genes, such as GH, that previously required LSD1 for activation.

Elastic fibres are assembled through polymerization of tropoelastin monomers and loss of elastin is associated with aneurysmal degeneration of the aorta 2.  The Fibulins are a six-member protein family hypothesized to function as intermolecular bridges that stabilize the organization of extracellular matrix structures such as elastic fibres and basement membranes 3.  Fibulin-4 is found in the medial layers of arteries and moderately expressed in heart valves 4.  To examine a potential role of Fibulin-4 in elastic fibre assembly and cardio-vascular disease we generated a mouse model underexpressing Fibulin-4. To get insight into the underlying molecular pathways involved in aneurysm formation, we determined the aorta transcriptome of Fibulin-4R/R animals and identified biological processes that were significantly overrepresented including apoptosis and cell death as well as several novel gene targets implicated in the response to aortic failure.  We conclude that decreased Fibulin-4 expression causes aberrant composition of the elastin layers in the aorta and valvular leaflets, resulting in aortic aneurysms and heart abnormalities.

Here, complete inactivation of NER in Csbm/m/Xpa-/- mutants causes a phenotype that reliably mimics the human progeroid CS syndrome. Newborn Csbm/m/Xpa-/- mice display attenuated growth, progressive neurological dysfunction, retinal degeneration, cachexia, kyphosis and die before weaning. To investigate whether a disturbance in growth and metabolism could explain the pronounced accelerated organismal deterioration seen in Csbm/m/Xpa-/- mice, we evaluated the liver transcriptome of 15-day old wt, single and double mutant mice (n=4). At this age, the Csbm/m/Xpa-/- pups have not yet become cachectic. Mouse liver transcriptome analysis and several physiological endpoints revealed systemic suppression of the GH/IGF1 somatotroph axis and oxidative metabolism, increased antioxidant responses, hypoglycemia together with hepatic glycogen and fat accumulation. Broad genome-wide parallels between Csbm/m/Xpa-/- and naturally aged mouse liver transcriptomes suggested that these changes are intrinsic to natural aging and the DNA repair-deficient mice. Importantly, wild type (wt) mice exposed to a low dose of chronic genotoxic stress and adult Csbm/m mutant mice recapitulated this response, thereby pointing to a novel link between genome instability and the age-related decline of the somatotroph axis.

Background. The transcription factor Gata3 is critically involved in epidermis and hair follicle differentiation. Yet, little is known about how Gata3 co-ordinates stem cell lineage determination in skin, which processes are mostly implicated and how Gata3 differentially regulates distinct cell populations within the hair follicle. Here, we describe a conditional Gata3-/- mouse (K14-Gata3-/-) in which Gata3 is specifically deleted in epidermis and hair follicles. Principal findings. K14-Gata3-/- mice show aberrant postnatal growth and development, delayed hair growth and maintenance, abnormal hair follicle organization and irregular pigmentation. After the first hair cycle, the germinative layer surrounding the dermal papilla was not restored; instead, proliferation was pronounced in basal epidermal cells. Transcriptome analysis of laser-dissected K14-Gata3-/- hair follicles as compared to wild type littermate controls, revealed mitosis, epithelial differentiation and the Notch, WNT and BMP signalling pathways to comprise significantly overrepresented processes. Conclusions. Subsequent elucidation of these pathways at the RNA and protein levels and physiologic endpoints shows that Gata3 integrates diverse signalling networks to regulate the balance between hair follicle and epidermal cell fates.

Mice devoid of all three of these proteins are born at expected Mendelian ratios, but are epilepsy-prone, age at an accelerated rate and die prematurely. In the hope of identifying PAR bZip target genes whose altered expression might contribute to the high morbidity and mortality of PAR bZip triple knockout mice, we compared the liver and kidney transcriptomes of these animals to those of wild-type or heterozygous mutant mice. These experiments revealed that PAR bZip proteins control the expression of many enzymes and regulators involved in detoxification and drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes, carboxylesterases, and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Indeed, PAR bZip triple knockout mice are  hypersensitive to xenobiotic compounds, and the deficiency in detoxification may contribute to their early ageing.

SCA1 is caused by an expanded polyglutamine within Atxn1 by gain-of-function mechanisms. Lack of Atxn1 in mice triggers motor deficits in the absence of neurodegeneration or apparent neuropathological abnormalities.We  extracted RNA from cerebellum of 5 Atxn1-null mice and 5 WT. Cerebellar gene expression profiles  at 15 weeks of age were generated usSCA1 ing Affymetrix MOE430A arrays. Identifying the molecular pathways regulated by Atxn1 can provide insights into the early molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction.

Cells-derived from the anterior- and posterior-sclerotome-halves from maturing mouse somites were compared to identify transcripts that are differentially expressed between these two halves of the somite.  c57b6-/- female mice were time-mated, and at 9.5-dpc embryos were harvested. Theiler stage 15 embryos were selected for dissection. A stripe of segmented paraxial mesoderm corresponding to somites SX-SXVIII (standard somite nomenclature) was dissected from one-side of an embryo. The most anterior-third of up to 7 sclerotomes within each sample were dissected and pooled in RNALater. RNA was isolated using RNeasy Micro RNA extraction spin columns (Qiagen). Reverse transcription and initial cDNA amplification was performed using 18 PCR cycles with the SMART cDNA system (Clontech). Amplified cDNA was then re-amplified and labeled using the GeneChip IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix).

The right posterior half presomitic mesoderms (PSM) from 17 mouse embryos were dissected while the contralateral side of the embryo containing the left PSM was immediately fixed to be analyzed by in situ hybridization using a Lfng probe to order the samples along the segmentation clock oscillation cycle. Probes were produced from RNA extracted from the 17 dissected posterior half PSMs using a two-step amplification protocol and were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430A. The reproducibility of the amplification procedure was initially assessed by comparing array data generated from the right and the left posterior PSM from the same embryo. Because of the symmetry of the paraxial mesoderm along the left-right axis, left and right samples are expected to show overtly similar gene expression. RNA was amplified from three such sample pairs (1, a and b; 2, a and b; 3, a and b) and hybridized on Murine Genome U74Av2 array (MG-U74Av2)

In this study, the authors compared the differences in gene expression between juvenile and adult dura mater using a mouse cDNA microarray with 42,000 unique elements. METHODS: Non-suture-associated parietal bone was harvested from 6-day-old and 60-day-old mice. The dura mater was carefully dissected from the calvarial disk and snap-frozen. RNA was extracted from pooled dura mater for microarray analysis. The 25 most differentially expressed genes were listed, as were selected bone-related genes. In addition, quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmation of selected genes-BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7; and osteopontin (OP), osteocalcin (OC), and FGFR-1-was performed. RESULTS: Juvenile dura mater expressed significantly greater amounts of BMP-2 and OP. Minimal difference in OC expression was observed between juvenile and adult dura mater. Extracellular matrix proteins (Col3a1, 5a1, 6a1, and fibronectin 1), osteoblast differentiation markers (Runx2/Cbfa1, Itm2a, and FGFR-1), and the growth factor Ptn were among other genes with greater expression in juvenile dura mater. Markers of osteoclasts (Acp5, MMP9, Ctsk) and the multiple candidate gene Ntrk2 were also expressed at higher levels in the juvenile dura mater. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a more differentiated osteoprogenitor population to exist along with a greater presence of osteoclasts in the juvenile dura mater relative to adults. In addition to establishing a baseline difference in gene expression between juvenile and adult dura mater, new genes potentially critical to the regenerative potential of juvenile calvaria were identified.

A series of purified testis cell-types (McCarrey libraries) constituting a focused gene set was exploited to examine gene expression in prepubertal mouse testis. Testis RNA from C57/BL6J mice at various ages post partum was compared to a common control consisting of adult (8 week) testis RNA from the same strain(also corresponding to the last time-point).This generates a time course showing the activation of genes on the array across the first wave of spermatogenesis, which can then be correlated with the appearance of specific germ cell types, allowing assignation of unknown genes to differing cell types.   Adult testis RNA from four different genetic models of infertility (XXSxrb, mshi, Bax -/-, bs) were compared to age- and strain-matched normal control testis RNA.  These models possess different cellular complements within the testis, which can be interpreted within the framework established by the first wave analysis and used to refine the assignment of genes to cell types.

The ability of juvenile animals to regenerate calvarial defects has been investigated in multiple animal models, including mice. In this study, the authors used cDNA microarrays to investigate the expression of osteogenesis-associated genes upstream and downstream of Runx2 in juvenile and adult mouse calvaria.  Methods: Nonsuture-associated parietal bone discs were harvested from 6-day-old (n = 50) and 60-day-old (n = 35) male CD-1 mice. After separation of the underlying dura mater and overlying pericranium, the calvarial discs were snap-frozen and RNA was extracted from pooled samples of calvaria for microarray analysis. Genes analyzed included cytokines, receptors, and cell-surface and matrix proteins both upstream and downstream of Runx2.  Results: Genes associated with the Runx2 pathway had notably higher levels in the juvenile versus adult calvaria. All genes except for osteocalcin were expressed at least twofold higher in the juvenile calvaria. This pattern was validated with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, mRNA for potent osteoinductive growth factors was present at higher levels in the juvenile compared with the adult calvaria.  Conclusions: These findings reflect a genomic environment of active osteoblast differentia-tion and ossification in the juvenile calvaria compared with the adult aquiescent calvarial tissue. These data suggest that a decreased osteogenic potential of adult calvarial osteoblasts may, in part, explain the inability of adult animals to heal calvarial defects.

High-density oligonucleotide arrays offer the opportunity to examine patterns of gene expression on a genome scale. Toward this end, we have designed custom arrays that interrogate the expression of the vast majority of protein-encoding human and mouse genes and have used them to profile a panel of 79 human and 61 mouse tissues. The resulting data set provides the expression patterns for thousands of predicted genes, as well as known and poorly characterized genes, from mice and humans. We have explored this data set for global trends in gene expression, evaluated commonly used lines of evidence in gene prediction methodologies, and investigated patterns indicative of chromosomal organization of transcription. We describe hundreds of regions of correlated transcription and show that some are subject to both tissue and parental allele-specific expression, suggesting a link between spatial expression and imprinting.

This characteristic makes them convenient models for the study of enamel formation, which occurs in several distinct stages along the tooth axis. The distribution and structure of mouse incisor enamel resemble that of the rat. The enamel covers only the labial aspect of the tooth, and can be divided into four layers: a thin inner prism-free layer, inner enamel with prism decussation, i.e. transverse rows of prisms with prisms inclined medially and laterally in alternate rows, outer enamel with parallel prisms inclined incisally and a thin superficial prism-free layer. Recently, we have described how this elaborate organization of the enamel is established in the initial enamel formed on the unerupted and unworn incisal tip of the incisors. The very first enamel formed, i.e. the most incisally situated enamel, is always prism-free, corresponding to the superficial layer in fully established enamel, although thicker.  Going in apical direction, i.e. in the direction of initiation of new enamel formation, isolated prisms appear among the crystals continuous with the prism-free zone crystals. These initial prisms are in general inclined incisally, corresponding to the prisms in the outer enamel layer in the fully established enamel. Inner enamel with the characteristic decussation pattern is added somewhat further apically and increases in thickness with increasing enamel thickness. Based on the structure of the enamel that they produce, the ameloblasts producing the initial, thin, prism-free enamel at the incisal tip of the unworn mouse incisor are probably differently configured (e.g. lacking Tomes' processes), probably differently organized (e.g. not organized in transverse rows moving sideways in opposite directions), and probably have a shorter life-span than the more apically situated ameloblasts which produce thicker enamel with the full four-layered configuration of mouse incisor enamel. For this reason it would be of interest to compare the gene expression profile of the incisal tip segment where prism-free enamel is being formed with the profile of the immediately adjacent segment where enamel with all four layers is being formed. As long as the incisor is unworn enamel formation and gene expression in these segments will likely reflect mechanistic differences between these segments as regards enamel biosynthesis. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level, and are considered as important regulatory molecules during foetal development. By binding to target mRNA, miRNA induce mRNA decay or translation repression. Recent bioinformatic predictions of miRNA targets in vertebrates indicate that hundreds of miRNAs are responsible for regulating the expression of up to 30% of the human protein-coding genes, and miRNAs have recently also been shown to regulate expression of hundreds of mRNAs in cultured cells. Recently, miRNA expression profiles of the developing murine molar tooth germ and submandibular salivary gland have been established. We here report expression profiling of miRNAs present in the two adjacent segments of the incisor tooth germ on which we also have carried out mRNA expression profiling. The results suggest that also miRNAs are abundantly, and differentially, expressed during development of the incisor tooth germ in mouse. By analogy with the mRNA data also miRNA expression is dynamic, with respect to both the two incisor segments investigated and to the developmental stage of the incisor.

All mice studied were C57BL/6 background and KO (knockout) Prss16-deficient mice were previously obtained by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells of a targeting vector carrying Neo resistance gene marker, which has allowed replacement of exons 8 to 12 of the Prss16 gene in KO mice (data not shown). Briefly, one properly targeted ES clone was injected into BALB/c blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric males were mated to C57BL/6 females to generate heterozygous pups in which the Neo selection cassette had been excised. Mice heterozygous for the mutation,originally on mixed 129/Sv x C57BL/6 genetic background, were intercrossed to generate homozygous mutants (Prss16-/-), WT (Prss16+/+) and heterozygousmutants (Prss16+/-) littermates. Genotype analysis was performed on genomic DNA from tail biopsies using PCR primers F (5' GCCTGACACAAGTCGCCATAGG 3'), R1 (5' CCAGTTCCTCCCTCAGCACAG 3') and R2 (5' CCAGTAAGAGTGAGGTCCAGAC 3'). The WT Prss16 allele was visualized as a 600 bp fragment using the F-R1 pair of primers, whereas the mutant allele was visualized as a 447 bp fragment using the F-R2 pair of primers. Absence of mRNA expression in the thymus of Prss16-/- mice was confirmed by northern-blot using a cDNA probe (data not shown). The Prss16 deficient mice were crossed onto a C57BL/6 background for eight generations and the thymi of the resulting mice were used for analysis.

So far, the potential of mapping both quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in rodents has been limited by the low mapping resolution inherent in crosses between inbred strains. We provide a megabase resolution map of thousands of eQTLs in hippocampus, lung, and liver samples from heterogeneous stock (HS) mice in which 843 QTLs have also been mapped at megabase resolution. We exploit dense mouse SNP data to show that artifacts due to allele-specific hybridization occur in _30% of the cis-acting eQTLs and, by comparison with exon expression data, we show that alternative splicing of the 3_ end of the genes accounts for <1% of cis-acting eQTLs. Approximately one third of cis-acting eQTLs and one half of trans-acting eQTLs are tissue specific. We have created an important systems biology resource for the genetic analysis of complex traits in a key model organism.

The loss of circadian PAR bZip transcription factors results in epilepsy, DBP (albumin D-site-binding protein), HLF (hepatic leukemia factor), and TEF (thyrotroph embryonic factor) are the three members of the PAR bZip (proline and acidic amino acid-rich basic leucine zipper) transcription factor family.  All three of these transcriptional regulatory proteins accumulate with robust circadian rhythms in tissues with high amplitudes of clock gene expression, such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the liver. However, they are expressed at nearly invariable levels in most brain regions, in which clock gene expression only cycles with low amplitude. Here we show that mice deficient for all three PAR bZip proteins are highly susceptible to generalized spontaneous and audiogenic epilepsies that frequently are lethal. Transcriptome profiling revealed pyridoxal kinase (Pdxk) as a target gene of PAR bZip proteins in both liver and brain. Pyridoxal kinase converts vitamin B6 derivatives into pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), the coenzyme of many enzymes involved in amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolism. PAR bZip-deficient mice show decreased brain levels of PLP, serotonin, and dopamine, and such changes have previously been reported to cause epilepsies in other systems. Hence, the expression of some clock-controlled genes, such as Pdxk, may have to remain within narrow limits in the brain. This could explain why the circadian oscillator has evolved to generate only low-amplitude cycles in most brain regions.; find REV-ERB ALPHA target genes

Yes|E-MTAB-42|Done|WT vs. Mutant|transcription profiling by array|2017-01-12|92|2675|Transcription profiling of first molar tooth germ in PPAR-alpha knock-out and wild type mice|Embryologically the tooth is derived from both the ectoderm and neural crest (ectomesenchyme). It is often used as a model to study how epithelial-mesenchymal interactions can control differentiation and morphogenesis. During early development organs of ectodermal origin share both a set of signalling molecules and exhibit common morphological features, subsequently proceeding along separate developmental programs.Tooth development is a continuous process that can be divided into the initiation -, bud -, cap -, and bell-stages. In mice, tooth development begins at embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5), by thickening of the dental epithelium, while mineralization of enamel and dentin in first molar starts at postnatal day 0 (P0) (5). A multistep and complex process of the gene expression are involved in the early stage of tooth development. So far expression of more than 1300 genes and/or proteins have been detected during tooth germ development by microarrays/immunocytochemistry/in situ hybridization. Studies with mutant mice have identified a number of genes that regulate tooth development and morphology. For example, deficiency of Lef-1  or P63  arrests tooth development at early stages. Deficiency of Msx1 or Pax9 results in arrest of tooth development at the bud stage , while deficiency of Runx2/Cbfa1 or Sp3 inhibits cyto-differentiation of ameloblasts and/or odontoblasts. Shh is required for normal growth and morphogenesis, but is not essential for cyto-differentiation of the ameloblast and odontoblast populations. Ameloblastin and amelogenin knock-out mice develop severe enamel hypoplasia with abnormal ameloblast differentiation. Recently, new connections between retinoid metabolism and PPAR responses have been identified. It has also been shown that endogenous retinoic acid is necessary for the initiation of odontogenesis , and that some of the genes that catalyze the oxidation of retinaldehyde into retinoic acid, exhibit distinct patterns of expression in developing murine teeth. Little is known about functions of PPAR-a as regards tooth germs or mature teeth. It is, however, likely that mitochondrial oxidative metabolism well as fatty acid metabolism is enhanced in late odontogenesis. These are metabolic activities which in other tissues are stimulated by PPAR-a agonists.For this reason it was of interest to carry out comparative gene expression profiling of the first molar tooth germs of PPAR-a knock-out mouse and of the corresponding wild-type mice. The results suggest marked differences in gene expression, parts of which may be associated with an observed hypomineralization of enamel in the mature PPAR-a knock-out murine tooth.

In adults, beta-cell replication is one of the mechanisms thought to cause the expansion of beta-cell mass. Efforts to treat diabetes require knowledge of the pathways that drive facultative beta-cell proliferation in vivo. A robust physiological stimulus of beta-cell expansion is pregnancy, and identifying the mechanisms underlying this stimulus may provide therapeutic leads for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The peak in beta-cell proliferation during pregnancy occurs on day 14.5 of gestation in mice. Using advanced genomic approaches, we globally characterize the gene expression signature of pancreatic islets on day 14.5 of gestation during pregnancy. We identify a total of 1,907 genes as differentially expressed in the islet during pregnancy. We demonstrate that the islet's ability to compensate for relative insulin deficiency during metabolic stress is associated with the induction of both proliferative and survival pathways. A comparison of the genes induced in three different models of islet expansion suggests that diverse mechanisms can be recruited to expand islet mass. The identification of many novel genes involved in islet expansion during pregnancy provides an important resource for diabetes researchers to further investigate how these factors contribute to the maintenance of not only islet mass, but ultimately beta-cell mass.

In the first one, whole dorsal aortas from embryonic day (E) 11 embryos and E9 embryos were dissected, tissues from each time point were pooled and their expression profile compared (whole aorta (WA) E9 vs E11). 3 different pools/biological replicas were obtained for each time point, a dye swap was included in each experiment, a technical replicate was performed for each pool (including the dye swap) and 2 self-self hybridisation controls were included. In the second comparison, GFP+ cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from pooled E9 and E11 aortas from transgenic embryos that express GFP under the regulatory elements of the Ly-6A gene. We obtained one pool for each time point and compared their transcription profile (GFP E9 vs E11). This comparison also contained a dye swap and a technical replicate (also of the dye swap). In the third comparison, the E11 aorta was cut into 3 roughly equal parts. Pools were obtained of the middle region ("m") and the two outer regions, rostral and caudal, together ("r+c") and their expression profile compared (11AO m vs r+c). There was one pool of each population, and the experiment included a dye swap and a technical replicate (also of the dye swap) and one self-self hybridisation control. Isolated RNA was amplified by T7-mediated in vitro transcription, with one round for the first and the third comparison and two rounds for the second comparison (sorted GFP+ cells). Probes were labelled during the reverse transcription step. Within array normalisation was achieved with Lowess Smooth and between arrays with Z scores. ANOVA analysis identified differentially expressed genes and K means clustering was used to segregate them into upregulated and downregulated genes.

Previous studies have shown Creb1-null mice suffer respiratory failure with lung atelectasis and a large reduction in Sftpd mRNA. Using a new line of Creb1-null mice we have further investigated Creb function in the developing mouse lung, focussing on differentiation of the airway epithelium. The lungs of Creb1-null fetal mice showed normal respiratory development until E17.5 when proximal and distal airways fail to inflate. Subsequent ultrastructural analysis of the lungs of E17.5 Creb1-null fetal mice revealed a defect in AEC differentiation with a reduction in proportions of type-II AECs and in particular, a very large reduction in type-I AECs. Furthermore, immunostaining for the proximal epithelial cell markers Scgb1a1 (also known as CC10) (Clara cells), Foxj1 (Ciliated cells), and CGRP (Neuroendocrine cells) showed delayed or defective proximal epithelial differentiation in Creb1-null fetal lungs. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis at E17.5 in Creb1-null fetal lungs showed differential expression of mRNAs for Creb/Atf1 subfamily members, surfactant-associated proteins, type-I AEC markers and proximal epithelial markers. Furthermore, whole-genome microarray analysis at E17.5 in Creb1-null fetal lungs has provided novel genes which will prove useful to further investigate Creb-mediated signalling in lung development. Together these results demonstrate that Creb plays a key role in determining cell lineages and differentiation of the developing lung epithelium.

First, we have analyzed the gene expression profile from a single skeletal muscle, the medial gastrocnemius (MG), and not from a pool of different muscles which could have different expression profiles. Second, we have performed the temporal gene expression profiling by extracting the MG muscles of the same individual from the both legs at two different times to minimize the inter-individual genetic variability. The MG muscle represent an excellent candidate for biopsy due to its easy accessible by surgery and also because its biopsy is well tolerated by the animals allowing us to perform another later biopsy in the other leg to obtain two MG samples of the same individual at two different times. Moreover, MG muscle is composed of approximately 20-30% type I (red) fibers and 70-80% type II (white) fibers {Ariano MA, 1973}, {Simard C, 1988}, {Zhan WZ, 1992} and therefore is more representative of skeletal muscle tissue in general than a muscle composed exclusively by red or white fibers.The transcript expression profiles in MG muscles from mdx and wild-type mice were analyzed at 3 weeks, 1.5 months and 3 months of life by using the 430 2.0 gene chips from Affymetrix (n=3 for each condition). The differentially expressed transcripts which showed differences ~1.5-fold were obtained by performing three different comparisons: 1) genes differentially expressed in mdx compared with controls at each point in time (additional file 1); 2) temporal analysis of the genes differentially expressed in mdx mice between the three points in time also compared with the variations in control mice (additional file 2); and 3) temporal analysis of the genes differentially expressed in control mice between the three points in time also compared with the variations in mdx mice (additional file 3). The first comparison that we performed, by comparing the gene expression between mdx and control mice at every point in time, was similar to that performed in previous longitudinal studies {Porter JD, 2003}, {Rouger K, 2002}, {Turk R, 2005}. However, the other two comparisons were directed to elucidate the genes that are varying throughout the period of time analyzed in every mice strain, and therefore we obtained on the one hand the genes that vary in mdx mice but not in wild-type, and on the other hand the genes that vary in control animals but remain unchanged in mdx mice between the times analyzed. To present the results in a more comprehensive form,  all the genes were classified in seven different categories: Cell adhesion & extracellular matrix; Proteolysis; Muscle structure & regeneration; Inflammation & immune response; Cell signaling & cell communication; Metabolism; and Others/unknown. The resulting genes from our study were classified in their functional categories using information from Affymetrix (www.affymetrix.com) and from the Gene Ontology database accessible in the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Genome Informatics website (www.informatics.jax.org).

This anterior homeotic transformation is first evident in the early embryonic Cdx2-deficient gut as expression of several key foregut endoderm regulators was shifted caudally. While the intestinal transcriptome was severely affected, Cdx2-deficiency only transiently modified selected posterior Hox genes and the primary enteric Hox code was maintained. Further, we demonstrate that Cdx2-directed intestinal cell fate adoption plays an important role in the establishment of normal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, as multiple signaling pathways involved in this process were severely affected. We conclude that Cdx2 controls important aspects of intestinal identity and development, and that this function is largely independent of the enteric Hox code. Gene ablation was achieved by creating a Cdx2 loxP/loxP mouse which was then crossed with a Foxa3-CRE mouse to yield Cdx2 loxP/loxP Foxa3-CRE mice.

Annexins A5 and A6 are postulated to represent the essential annexins promoting cartilage mineralisation. However, skeletal development appears to be normal in annexin A5 or A6 deficient mice. The highly conserved structures of annexins led to the assumption that annexins A5 and A6 may fulfill redundant functions. We now generated mice deficient for both proteins, annexins A5 and A6. Mice were viable, fertile and showed no obvious abnormalities. Assessment of skeletal elements using histological, ultrastructural and peripheral quantitative computed tomography methods revealed that mineralisation and development of the skeleton was not significantly affected in mutant mice. In respect of the lack of an obvious phenotype we now applied microarray analysis to the growth plate to define changes in the transcriptome of juvenile murine growth plates from mutant mice. Global gene expression analysis revealed subtle phenotypes at the transcriptome level of genes involved in cell growth and intermediate metabolism in mutant mice. These data demonstrate that both annexins are dispensable for proper cartilage mineralisation but may affect cell proliferation processes at the transcriptomic level.

It results from a C470R mutation in the proprotein convertase PCSK5 (PC5/6, SPC6) that fails to complement a null allele, which also has a similar phenotype. The mutation ablates a predicted disulfide bond in the P domain, and results in reduced secretion, abnormal cellular localisation, and loss of proprotein convertase activity. We analysed whole genome gene expression in a mouse line carrying ENU-generated point mutation in Pcsk5 gene on  a mixed background : 25% C57BL6/J on C3H/HeH (mutation originally introduced into C57BL6/J). We show that GDF11, a regulator of Hox expression, anteroposterior patterning and nephrogenesis, is a PCSK5 target, and that Pcsk5 mutation results in abnormal expression of several paralogous caudal Hox genes (Hoxa, Hoxc, Hoxd), and Mnx1 (Hlxb9) that are necessary for caudal embryo development. Our data establishes novel and pleiotropic functions for Pcsk5 in mammalian development and the coordinated expression of caudal Hox genes; and identifies GDF11 as a novel cleavage target for PCSK5. We propose that Pcsk5, at least in part via GDF11, coordinately regulates the expression of caudal Hox paralogs, to control antero-posterior patterning, nephrogenesis, and skeletal and anorectal development.

The similar pathological and clinical profiles of different forms of NCL suggest that common disease mechanisms may be involved. Here, we have performed quantitative gene expression profiling of cortex from targeted knock out mice produced for Cln1 and Cln5 to explore NCL-associated molecular pathways. Combined microarray datasets from both mouse models exposed a common affected pathway: genes regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal growth cone stabilization display similar aberrations. We analyzed locus specific gene expression and showed regional clustering of Cln1 and three major genes of this pathway, further supporting a close functional relationship between the corresponding gene products, Cap1, Ptprf and Ptp4a2. The evidence from the gene expression data was substantiated by immunohistochemical staining data of Cln1-/- and Cln5-/- cortical neurons. These primary neurons displayed abnormalities in beta-tubulin and actin as well as abnormal intracellular distribution of growth cone associated proteins GAP-43, synapsin and Rab3. Our data provide the first evidence for a common molecular pathogenesis behind neuronal degeneration in CLN1 and CLN5. Since CLN1 and CLN5 code for proteins with distinct functional roles these data may have implications for other forms of NCL.

Here it was proposed to participate in lowering the cytoplasmic Cl- concentration of neurons, a process that establishes an inhibitory response to the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine (Staley et al., 1996). Heterozygous mutations in CLCN2 (the gene encoding ClC-2) were recently reported in a few patients with three clinically distinct forms of epilepsy (Haug et al, 2003). However, the disruption of ClC-2 in mice (ClC-2 KO mouse) did not entail epilepsy (Bosl et al., 2001; Nehrke et al., 2002) but myelin vacuolation in fiber tracts of the central nervous system. We used a gene expression profiling of the ClC-2 KO mouse in brain to identify possible disease mechanism which cause the observed myelin phenotype. As these myelin vacuolation became apparent in the fiber tracts of ClC-2 KO cerebellum at P28 and increased with age, we analysed the cerebellum of ClC-2 KO mice at different postnatal ages, before (P14) and after (P35) the KO cerebellum has been affected by myelin vacuolation.

The splicing factor Tra2b (Sfrs10) can modulate splicing inclusion of exons by specifically detecting GAA-rich binding motifs and its absence causes early embryonic lethality in mice. TRA2B has been shown to be involved in splicing processes of Nasp (nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein), MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau) and SMN (survival motor neuron), and is therefore implicated in spermatogenesis and neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease and spinal muscular atrophy. Here we generated a neuronal-specific Tra2b knock-out mouse that lacks Tra2b expression in neuronal and glial precursor cells by using the Nestin-Cre. Neuronal-specific Tra2b knock-out mice die immediately after birth and show severe abnormalities in cortical development, which are caused by massive apoptotic events in the ventricular layers of the cortex, demonstrating a pivotal role of Tra2b for the developing central nervous system. Using whole brain RNA on exon arrays we identified differentially expressed alternative exons of Tubulin delta1 and Shugoshin like2 as in vivo targets of Tra2b. Most interestingly, we found increased expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (p21) which we could functionally link to neuronal precursor cells in the affected brain regions. We provide further evidence that the absence of Tra2b causes p21 upregulation and ultimately cell death in NSC34 neuronal-like cells. These findings demonstrate that Tra2b regulates splicing events essential for maintaining neuronal viability during development. Apoptotic events triggered via p21 might not be restricted to the developing brain but could possibly be generalized to the whole organism and explain early embryonic lethality in Tra2b-depleted mice.

Key molecules have been defined which regulate ureteric bud initiation and drive the differentiation of ureteric mesenchyme into peristaltic smooth muscle. Less is known about mechanisms underlying the developmental patterning of the multilayered epithelium characterising the mature ureter. In skin, which also contains a multilayered epithelium, cytokeratin 15 (CK15), an intermediate filament protein, is a marker for cells whose progeny contribute to epidermal regeneration following wounding. Moreover, CK15+ precursor cells in skin can give rise to basal cell carcinomas. In the current study, using transcriptome microarrays of embryonic wild type mouse ureters, we detected Krt15, coding for CK15.

To establish a map of epiblast (EPI) versus primitive endoderm (PrE) lineage segregation which occurs within the inner cell mass (ICM), we comprehensively characterised the gene expression profiles of individual inner cells during blastocyst development.

Current evidence indicates that brown adipocytes arise from Myf5+-dermotomal precursors through the action of a PRDM16-C/EBP-beta transcriptional complex; however, the underlying mechanisms that determine lineage specification and maintenance of brown adipose cells remain poorly understood. Here we study the role of euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1), a brown fat-enriched lysine methyltransferase, as an essential enzymatic component of the PRDM16 transcriptional complex and controls brown adipose cell fate. To identify targets and function of EHMT1, we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling of BAT from control mouse (Ehmt1flox/flox), Ehmt1Myf5 KO mouse (Myf5-Cre+/-; Ehmt1flox/flox) and Ehmt1adipo KO mouse (Adipo-Cre+/-; Ehmt1flox/flox). Loss of EHMT1 in Myf5+ lineage causes a near total loss of brown fat characteristics and induces muscle-selective gene program in vivo. In addition, adipose-specific deletion of EHMT1 by Adipo-Cre leads to a marked reduction of the thermogenic and fat oxidation genes.

The aim is to find genes whose expression is altered in trans depending on whether the mother or father carried a knockout allele for H2-ab1. In this experiment differential expression of a gene is inferred from a difference in its overall expression levels. We sequenced RNA from 30 F1 mice from the H2-ab1 heterozygous cross. Both heterozygous and wild type F1 animals were sequenced in order to find both parental and parent of origin effects.

Numerous cytokine gene expression changes are stimulated by accumulation of bile acids in livers of young Foxa2 liver-conditional null mice. We hypothesized that bile acid-induced inflammation in young Foxa2 mutants, once chronic, affects metabolic homeostasis. We found that loss of Foxa2 in the liver results in a premature aging phenotype, including significant weight gain, reduced food intake, and decreased energy expenditure.  We show that Foxa2 antagonizes the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in increased hepatic lipogenesis and adiposity. While much prior work has focused on adipose tissue in obesity, we discovered a novel age-onset obesity phenotype in a model where genetic deletion occurs only in the liver, underscoring the importance of the role hepatic lipogenesis plays in the development of obesity.

Absence of miR-22 results in partial embryonic lethality arising from cardiac malformations. miR-22-null mice that survived until adulthood showed normal cardiac structure and function at baseline but were sensitized to cardiac dysfunction and dilation following pressure overload stimulation. Absence of miR-22 prevented the induction of beta-myosin heavy chain (Myh7) and miR-208b expression following pathologic stress. miR-22 null animals were also compromised in cardiac expression of Myh7b and miR-499. We found that miR-22 directly regulates two transcriptional antagonists, purine rich element binding protein B (PURB), a repressor, and serum response factor (SRF), an activator, in the heart. Through these gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mice, we suggest that a primary function of miR-22 is to fine tune the relative expression and activity of these two transcriptional antagonists to influence contractile gene expression, function, growth and adaptation of the heart to stress.

In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying ER control of liver metabolic function, we investigated the genetic programs controlled by the hepatic receptor during the physiological fluctuation of circulating E2 in adult female mice. To this aim, we used Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays and compared the expression of hepatic genes in mice in two phases of the estrous cycle: Proestrus (P) and Metestrus (M), characterized by high and low circulating E2 respectively. Analysis of data demonstrated that the expression of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism changes during the reproductive cycle. To further elucidate ER transcriptional activity at M and P, we performed a whole genome ChIP experiment followed by tiling array. We observed that at M, but not at P, recruited ERs are mostly in proximity (20 kbp) of genes involved in energy metabolism, thus strengthening the hypothesis of ER playing a bridging role between metabolism and reproduction.

Unexpectedly we found lethality, due to post-natal lung haemorrhage, occurred in Igf2 paternal null allele female mice (Igf2-p) but only if derived from double heterozygote fathers (Igf2-p, p53+/-). Consequently we investigated the effects of paternal genotype (wild-type, Igf2-p and Igf2-p, p53+/-) on gene expression. Microarray gene expression profiling of whole mouse embryos (embryonic day 9.5) revealed that lethality was associated with a specific gene signature. Since double heterozygote female offspring (Igf2-p, p53+/-) of Igf2-p, p53+/- fathers did not have the lethality phenotype we identified gene expression changes associated with this 'rescue'.

MiR-145 is upregulated in pulmonary arterial hypertension in humans and female mice.  It has been observed that miR-145 knock out mice have reduced vascular remodelling in response to hypoxia.  Therefore, knock down of miR-145 could be used as a therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in humans.  This microarray has helped us to elucidate some of the pathways in the miR-145 knock out mice that may protect against vascular remodelling.   Wild type (WT) mice and homozygous miR-145 -/- female mice (strain C57BL6J/129SVEV) at 8 weeks old were exposed to chronic hypoxia for 2 weeks or maintained in normoxic conditions and pulmonary arteries were dissected at 10 weeks of age.

Yes|E-AFMX-1|Done|Baseline|transcription profiling by array|2016-12-15|55|1479|Transcription profiling of human, chimp and mouse brain|Microarray technologies allow the identification of large numbers of expression differences within and between species. Although environmental and physiological stimuli are clearly responsible for changes in the expression levels of many genes, it is not known whether the majority of changes of gene expression fixed during evolution between species and between various tissues within a species are caused by Darwinian selection or by stochastic processes. We find the following: (1) expression differences between species accumulate approximately linearly with time; (2) gene expression variation among individuals within a species correlates positively with expression divergence between species; (3) rates of expression divergence between species do not differ significantly between intact genes and expressed pseudogenes; (4) expression differences between brain regions within a species have accumulated approximately linearly with time since these regions emerged during evolution. These results suggest that the majority of expression differences observed between species are selectively neutral or nearly neutral and likely to be of little or no functional significance. Therefore, the identification of gene expression differences between species fixed by selection should be based on null hypotheses assuming functional neutrality. Furthermore, it may be possible to apply a molecular clock based on expression differences to infer the evolutionary history of tissues.
Yes|E-TABM-1188|Done|WT vs. Mutant|transcription profiling by array|2017-09-26|22|3434|IGR_SYNCYTINB_STUDY_AD|In most mammalian species, a critical step of placental development is the fusion of trophoblast cell into a multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast layer, which separates the fetal and maternal blood circulations. Advancement in understanding this process came from the identification of two pairs of envelope genes of retroviral origin, independently acquired by the human (syncytin-1 and -2) and mouse (syncytin-A and -B) genomes, specifically expressed in the placenta and with in vitro cell-cell fusion activity. We previously showed that syncytin-A is involved in the formation of one of the two syncytiotrophoblast layer of the mouse placenta -ST-I , facing the maternal lacuna- with syncytin-A null embryos dying at mid-gestation, and their placenta disclosing impaired formation of the ST-I layer. Here by generating syncytin-B KO mice, we demonstrated that syncytin-B null placenta have defects in formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer-II facing the fetal blood vessels, with refined electron microscopy analyses showing evidence of unfused apposed cells. Lack of trophoblast fusion is associated with signs of trophoblast degeneration and with formation of huge maternal blood lacuna, ultimately disrupting the architecture of the labyrinth layer. These alterations did not result in complete abortion of syncytin-B null embryos, at variance with the syncytin-A KO phenotype, but in a reduced proportion of homozygous syncytin-B knockout individuals at birth, with evidence of late-onset embryonic growth retardation. Double knockout mice experiments demonstrate a premature death of syncytin-A null embryos if syncytin-B is deleted, thus strongly suggesting cooperative involvement of both syncytiotrophoblast layer-I and layer-II for the structural and functional integrity of the maternofetal interface and exchanges. Finally, a microarray analysis of wild-type and syncytin-B null placenta transcripts disclosed alterations in gene expression level for only a very limited number of genes, with the largest change (a 7-fold induction in the syncytin-B null placenta) observed for the connexin-30 gene. Immunohistochemistry further localized the connexin-30 protein in the labyrinth zone of mutant placenta, at the level of the fetomaternal interface. It is proposed that this might correspond to a compensatory process whereby disruption of syncytialization in syncytin-B knockout placenta is counteracted by an enhanced, gap junction mediated, cell-cell communication. These data demonstrate that syncytin-B is required for ST-II syncytial differentiation and the functional integrity of the labyrinth. Altogether, these findings definitively demonstrate that the two endogenous retroviral syncytin-A and -B Env genes contribute independently to the formation of the two syncytiotrophoblast layers during placenta formation, and provide additional insights into the subtle mechanisms of syncytiotrophoblast differentiation in the mouse. Experimental design: Placenta RNA of embryos homozygous for the syncytin-B deletion (SynB-/-) were compared to placental RNA of wild-type embryos (SynB+/+) of the same litter. Two stages of gestation, day 12 and d14, were analyzed. At day 12, 3 litters were obtained; for two of them, the RNAs were analyzed individually, and for the third one, placenta RNAs of the wild-type genotype were pooled. At day 14, one litter was obtained;  RNA samples with the same genotype were pooled

We combined pol III occupancy from genomically discrete tRNA loci into collective binding into isoacceptor classes and then into amino acid-based isotype classes, and at each step we found increasing conservation.  At the level of amino acid isotypes, pol III binding is almost invariant among all the tissues and species profiled.  Thus, the basal transcriptional machinery is constrained collectively in its synthesis of functional tRNA isotypes, despite rapid divergence of polymerase binding to specific tRNA genes.

Binding to nucleosomal DNA is critical for   pioneer   transcription factors such as Foxa1 and Foxa2 to regulate chromatin structure and gene activation. Here we report the genome-wide map of nucleosome positions in the mouse liver, with emphasis on transcriptional start sites, CpG islands, Foxa2 binding sites, and their correlation with gene expression. Despite the heterogeneity of liver tissue, we could clearly discern the nucleosome pattern of the predominant liver cell, the hepatocyte. By analyzing nucleosome occupancy and the distributions of heterochromatin protein 1 (Hp1), CBP, and p300 in Foxa1/2-deficient livers we find, surprisingly, that the maintenance of nucleosome position and chromatin structure surrounding Foxa2 binding sites is independent of Foxa1/2.

The goal of this experiment was to understand the basis of female hypofertility/embryonic resorption in a mouse model of congenic strains. The IRCS strain used in this experiment is the 66H Ch13 mouse. This strain was derived by introgression of a ~6 Mb fragment of mus spretus origin inside the genome of Mus musculus (C57B6/J) (L'Hote et  al, Bioessays, 2010. PMID:20091755 ) Previous ultrasonographic analysis of this line revealed an increased rate of embryonic resorption compared to the C57B6/J parent (Laissue et al, Int. J . Dev. Biol, 2009 PMID: 19488966 ). In this experiment we measured gene expression in the tissues that are relevant for implantation and early development, i.e. the uterus and the placenta, in C57B6/J and 66H Chr13 mice at 12 days post-coitus with C57B6/J males. Pools of RNA from four mice per sample were obtained and analysed using a Nimblegen mouse expression array.

In addition, RabGEF1-deficient mice develop morbidity and severe skin inflammation associated with marked increases in skin mast cell numbers (Tam et al., Nat Immunol, 5(8):844-52, 2004). These findings suggest that over-reactive skin mast cells may contribute to the observed skin pathology in vivo.  In order to identify the cell type(s) which contribute to skin inflammation when RabGEF1 is absent, we attempted to delete Rabgef1 gene specifically in three major skin cell types, namely mast cells, myeloid cells and keratinocytes; thus, Rabgef1 floxed (fl/fl) mice were crossed with mice expressing the Cre-recombinase under the influence of the promoter of Mcpt5, LysZ or K14, respectively. Unexpectedly, Mcpt5-Cre;Rabgef1fl/fl and Lysz-Cre;Rabgef1fl/fl mice appeared normal without phenotypic abnormalities. However, K14-Cre;Rabgef1fl/fl mice were normal at birth but rapidly developed morbidity and skin inflammation after 2-3 days, and died between 1 and 8 weeks of age. Skin (epidermis + dermis) was sampled from the center of the back behind shoulders, for 2 conditional knock-out mice (Rabgef1 lox/lox  K14-Cre, hereafter called Rabgef1K-KO) and 2 control mice (Rabgef1 lox/lox). Total  RNA was isolated from mouse skin using Trizol. Gene expression analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays, with two replicates per genotype. Microarray data were analysed using Bioconductor for R.

Despite its anti-steatotic functions, STAT5 in hepatocytes has been implicated to be a tumor suppressor, whose loss strongly accelerates tumor formation in the presence of high GH levels. Yet, it remains unclear whether the upstream kinase JAK2 exerts similar tumor-suppressive functions. To address this question, we crossed a mouse model of inflammatory liver cancer (GHtg) to mice harboring the hepatocyte-specific deletion of JAK2 (JAK2deltahep) and compared them to GHtgSTAT5  hep mice. We show that JAK2 deficiency in the GHtg background resulted in profound steatosis at young age due to ectopic lipid redistribution and increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased in all genotypes compared to wildtype controls, while DNA damage and lipid peroxidation were observed only in GHtg and GHtgSTAT5deltahep animals. Importantly, Affymetrix analysis revealed that the expression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a major group of detoxification enzymes, was strongly upregulated in JAK2 deficient livers. In vitro and in vivo studies further confirmed that ruxolitinib-mediated inhibition of JAK2 led to significant upregulation of GSTs, indicating a direct involvement of JAK2 in the negative regulation of these genes. Strikingly, despite equally profound hepatosteatosis and ROS production as in GHtgSTAT5deltahep mice, loss of JAK2 significantly delayed tumor formation in GHtg mice.  Conclusion: Thus, in absence of hepatic JAK2, mice were protected against elevated ROS-induced DNA damage and lipid peroxidation through significant expression of GSTs.

Increasing dietary fat intake results in increased hepatic fat deposition, which is associated with a risk for development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we demonstrate a role for the phosphate inorganic transporter 1 (PiT1/SLC20A1) in regulating metabolism. Specific knockout of Pit1 in hepatocytes significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, enhanced insulin signalling, and decreased hepatic lipogenesis. We identified USP7 as a PiT1 binding partner and demonstrated that Pit1 deletion inhibited USP7/IRS1 dissociation upon insulin stimulation. This prevented IRS1 ubiquitination and its subsequent proteasomal degradation. As a consequence delayed insulin negative feedback loop and sustained insulin signalling were observed. Moreover, PiT1-deficient mice were protected against high fat diet-induced obesity and diabetes. Our findings indicate that PiT1 has potential as a therapeutic target in the context of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes.

A key protein in the macroautophagic machinery is the autophagy related protein (Atg) 7. Constitutive deletion of Atg7 is lethal at birth. A conditional deletion of Atg7 in hepatocytes leads to hepatomegaly and in aged animals to liver tumors. With this study, we aimed at analyzing the hepatomegaly development more detailed. The 3- to 4-fold enlargement of the liver takes place between day 25 and 35 after birth (P25-P35) and persists at least until P90. This is accompanied by a change in the expression of enzymes involved in the glycogen/glucose metabolism. While glycogen synthesis is inhibited, glucose is preferentially kept as glucose-6-phosphate inside the cells, inducing a swelling of the cells caused by hyperosmolarity. An increase of lipogenic enzymes suggests that glucose-6-phosphate is delivered to lipogenic pathways, which is supported by the occurrence of a steatosis around P30. The development of hepatomegaly is accompanied by a polyploidisation of hepatocytes, an enhanced expression of genes related to inflammatory processes, and an infiltration of macrophages. Our data provide evidence that the attenuation of macroautophagy in hepatocytes leads to a glucose retention which causes cell swelling. The resulting hepatomegaly, which develops in a time interval of about 10 days, perturbs liver perfusion and induces an inflammatory reaction together with polyploidisation.

These determinants are considered to be rather conserved across mice, leading different strains of mice to be used interchangeably. We challenged this assumption and studied the relationship between oocyte composition and developmental quality in four inbred strains of mice, namely 129Sv, C57Bl/6, C3H/HeN and DBA/2J. These oocytes showed large variability developmental competence and embryo quality irrespective of the developmental stimulus (fertilization, somatic cell nuclear transfer, parthenogenesis). To unravel the molecular basis of the observed phenotypes we applied state-of-the-art proteomics (SILAC LC-MS/MS) combined with transcriptomics (RNA deep sequencing). We quantified 1839 proteins and 20413 transcripts simultaneously in oocytes of all four strains. The proteome and the transcriptome had little correlation with each other, highlighting the importance of proteomic quantifications in embryology. We found that proteins that were most variably expressed between oocytes from different strains mainly relate to oocyte biology, ribosome and RNA biogenesis as well as embryo differentiation and chromatin remodelling. Thus, different strains of mice should not be used interchangeably in biology when tackling questions about oogenesis and early development.

Embryos are imaged using HREM, placentas are examined by histology and mutant embryo mRNA expression profiles are compared to wild type. To underpin these investigations we have produced a comprehensive time series of gene expression through normal embryo development. Total RNA was extracted from somite number staged wildtype embryos with no history of genetic modification in previous generations from the Mouse Genetics Programme (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/collaboration/mouse-resource-portal) and DNase treated.

Some targets of miR-96 are known, but it is likely that many still remain to be discovered. MicroRNAs function by recruiting the RISC complex to their mRNA targets, so one way to examine the mRNAs being controlled by microRNAs in a cell is to immunoprecipitate Ago2, one of the RISC proteins, and extract the RNA bound to it.

We have successfully crossed these two strains and generated double knockout mice (PAI-1--/HK-ATPase--) and 3 different control groups (PAI-1++/HK-ATPase++, PAI-1--/HK-ATPase++ and PAI-1++/HK-ATPase--) (9 animals in each group). The gastric phenotype of all mice has been examined by morphologic and molecular analysis after 12 months. Gastric biopsies and blood samples have been taken for histology, large scale gene expression analysis, verification of mRNA and protein expression and gastrin measurements. Global gene expression analysis has been done on gastric mucosal samples from all groups of mice. The differences between wild type mice and the transgenic animals are expected to provide novel hypotheses on the role of PAI-1 in gastrin-induced changes in the gastric mucosa.

Transient rises in [Ca2+]i mainly emerge from Ca2+ released by the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1) and, in non-adult muscle, by the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), the dominant Ca2+ store in skeletal muscle. While the IP3R-mediated, slow Ca2+ transients, have been implicated in cell signaling and development, RYR1   s non-contractile role(s) remain obscure. We used a homozygous mouse RyR1 knockout model (dyspedic) to investigate the effects of the absence of a functional RYR1 and, consequently, the lack of RyR1-mediated Ca2+ signaling during embryogenesis. While heterozygous mice of the model are undistinguishable from WT littermates, homozygous dyspedic mice die at birth from asphyxia, since their skeletal muscle does not support EC coupling. Furthermore, they display abnormal spine curvature, subcutaneous hematomas, small limbs, and enlarged neck. Skeletal muscles from front and hind limbs of dyspedic embryos (day E18.5) were subjected to microarray analyses, revealing 318 genes, significantly regulated by at least 50 % compared to control heterozygous littermates.

Embryos are imaged using HREM, placentas are examined by histology and mutant embryo mRNA expression profiles are compared to wild type.  To underpin these investigations we have produced a comprehensive time series of gene expression through normal embryo development.  Total RNA was extracted from somite number staged, second generation genotypically wild type, C57BL/6N embryos of mixed G0 lineages from the Mouse Genetics Programme (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/collaboration/mouse-resource-portal) and DNase treated. Stranded RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA protocol with oligo dT pulldown. Notes about samples and libraries: (1) A combination of litter identifier and embryo identifier within a litter will unambiguously identify a single embryo used in this study. (2) There is a margin of error for the somite-stage information (+/- 1 somite) because some embryos could be in between somite stages.  (3) All knockouts in the parents or grandparents are for embryonic lethal genes. (4) There are four biological replicates per somite-stage, with the exception of the 4-somite embryos (three biological replicates only).  Altogether 111 embryos were sourced, of which 14 were sequenced twice to generate enough read depth/coverage.  No new libraries were prepared for the repeated sequencing, despite the assays being assigned new ERX* accessions.  (5) Sex of the embryos was determined post-RNA-seq by looking at the expression of Xist (strong expression in females only).  (6) Library construction batch refers to batch of sample handling post RNA-extraction (size selection, PCR amplification during library preparation). (7) Superbatch gathers 17 representative embryos out of the 111 embryos post RNA-extraction, and put them through the library construction pipeline as one single batch. The generated data is intended to be used for normalisation using the remove unwanted variation (RUV) method.    This data is part of a pre-publication release.

Here, we demonstrate that the vast majority of pachytene piRNAs originate from less than 100 bi- and unidirectionally transcribed loci in the mouse genome.  These loci show features characteristic of transcribed protein-coding genes, including primary transcription by RNA polymerase II, H3K4 trimethylation marking the transcription initiation site, and H3K36 trimethylation present at elongation regions in a highly tissue-specific manner.  We identified MYBL1, a spermatocyte-enriched transcription factor, as a potential driver of piRNA precursor transcripts.  By similarly mapping piRNA clusters in testes of dog and opossum, we revealed that the regulatory architectures generating piRNAs appear to be highly conserved in mammals.  Finally, we discovered that apparently neutral chromosomal rearrangements in evolution can act as an unexpected mechanism to generate novel piRNA clusters in diverse mammals.  Thus, our results demonstrate how an integrated, multi-species approach can help define the genomic features and evolutionary mechanisms underlying mammalian germline noncoding RNAs.

In different brain regions these processes occur at slightly different stages of development. As gene expression patterns greatly differ between different cell populations and brain regions, the period of early brain development is characterized by very dynamic gene expression profiles. Therefore, we assessed gene expression in brains from mice at different stages of embryonic development (E9, E10, E11, E14 and E17) using Affymetrix GeneChIP mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays.

Genomic imprinting is highly tissue-specific, and mammalian brains are hot spots for this effect. Social behaviour defects in human and various behavioural changes in mouse, had been linked to inappropriate imprinting, but little is known about how and why such effects occur.The olfactory system in the brain is the essential sensory circuitry that mediates rodent innate behaviour. Meanwhile, monoallelic expression, a related process, is used extensively in chemosensory neurons to regulate olfactory and vomeronasal receptor choice. We have data showing receptor gene choice is not a random process, which implies allele choice may beb iased also. The olfactory system is therefore a promising target for detecting allelic imbalance, or even novel imprinting genes, by high-resolution RNA-sequencing followed by allelic-specific transcriptomic mapping.This project is designed to detect parent-of-origin and strain-of-origin allelic expression bias in neurons from a key olfactory tissues in rodents: vomernasal organ (VNO) . RNA from reciprocally crossed F1 hybrid mice (S-cross and M-cross) from two distinct inbred strains (C57BL/6J and CAST) have been extracted respectively.

MafB is essential for alpha and beta cell differentiation, as MafB deficient mice produced fewer insulin+ and glucagon+ cells during development, with MafA expressed in remaining insulin+ cells. In contrast, beta cell development was reported to be normal in a total MafA knock out, although the animals developed beta cell dysfunction and diabetes as adults. However, we have found that MafB expression is elevated during development and retained in adult insulin+ cells after conditional removal of MafA in the pancreas. These studies will evaluate the broader significance of these insulin and glucagon regulators in alpha and beta cell development and function. Our efforts will focus on determining if the concerted actions of MafA and MafB factors are significant to beta cell formation, and we specifically plan to: Determine how alpha and beta cell differentiation is affected in MafA/MafB compound mutant mice during pancreas development. cDNA microarray studies (pancchip 6.0) with wild type, MafAKO, MafB-/-, and MafAKOMafB-/- mutant E18.5 pancreata will be performed to comprehensively identify genes controlled by MafA and MafB in developing alpha and beta cells.

Here, we quantitatively characterized the expression of mRNA and tRNA genes across developing mouse tissues. Substantial fractions of both gene sets dynamically change expression from early organogenesis to adult tissues. mRNA codon pools are highly stable over development and reflect the genomic background; in contrast, changes in transcription at specific tRNA genes are coordinated across anticodon families to produce a stable isoacceptor output. During development, the pools of mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons are invariant and highly correlated, revealing a stable molecular interaction interlocking transcription and translation.

The aim of this experiment was to determine the ability to identify differentially expressed genes in islet and pancreas RNA, and the sensitivity of the two platforms, using the same source material in a carefully controlled manner. RNA was extracted from adult mouse pancreas (n=5) and highly purified islet samples (n = 5). All samples were amplified once. 5 biological replicates (islets vs. pancreas) in a dye swap experimental design were hybridized to the PancChip. 3 biological replicates, using the same amplified RNA hybridized to the PancChip, of both the pancreas and islet samples were also hybridized to the GeneChip. All data were normalized using appropriate methods and differential expression between islet and pancreas was determined using PaGE with a 10% FDR. The study revealed that the PancChip is a highly cost effective alternative to the Affymetrix 430-2, that the PancChip is up to 60% more sensitive than the Affymetrix 430-2 GeneChip and that 80% (7,000) of the probe sets on the PancChip show expression in either Islets or Pancreas, while only 25% (6,800) show expression on the Affymetrix GeneChip.

Genomic imprinting is highly tissue-specific, and mammalian brains are hot spots for this effect. Social behaviour defects in human and various behavioural changes in mouse, had been linked to inappropriate imprinting, but little is known about how and why such effects occur. The olfactory system in the brain is the essential sensory circuitry that mediates rodent innate behaviour. Meanwhile, monoallelic expression, a related process, is used extensively in chemosensory neurons to regulate olfactory and vomeronasal receptor choice. We have data showing receptor gene choice is not a random process, which implies allele choice may be biased also. The olfactory system is therefore a promising target for detecting allelic imbalance, or even novel imprinting genes, by high-resolution RNA-sequencing followed by allelic-specific transcriptomic mapping.This project is designed to detect parent-of-origin and strain-of-origin allelic expression bias in neurons from two olfactory tissues: main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and olfaction bulb (OB). RNA from reciprocally crossed F1 hybrid mice (S-cross and M-cross) from two distinct inbred strains (C57BL/6J and CAST) have been extracted respectively (two crosses, two tissue types). After sequencing,expression levels from each allele will be distinguished by incorporating SNP and indel differences to the strain-specific reference genomes. Analysis will be carried out in collaboration with Gary Churchill's team at the Jackson Laboratory (who have developed a method of analysing RNAseq data from CAST x C57BL/6J F1s). Genes with strong, reproducible allelic imbalances will be followed up to assess the functional consequences.

This phenomenon was then termed promiscuous gene expression (PGE). A large set of autoantigen genes (but not all) is controlled by the transcriptional modulator Autoimmune regulator (Aire) in mTECs.  These autoantigens represent all tissues and organs in the thymus and it is implicated in the negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes, and consequantly preventing autoreactive autoimmune reactions and autoimmune diseases (e.g. type 1 diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus). Thus, we are looking at gene expression in these cells because it is very important to better understand the molecular basis of central immune tolerance to normal tissues and organs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible link between the expression of the transcriptional regulator Aire, the genetic background of mouse strains and the promiscuous gene expression in mTECs.

Previously, our group and several other studies showed that TDP-43 binds to several RNA targets in the mammalian CNS. ALS causing mutations in the C-terminal region of TDP-43 that is involved in splicing regulation may lead to aberrant splicing of several RNA transcripts. The main aim of this study is to identify the effect of an ALS causing mutation on the splicing regulation of previously known targets of TDP-43. Mice overexpressing a mutant human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) gene were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (strain name - B6;CB-Tg(Prnp-TARDBP*A315T) 95Balo/J; Stock no:010700). Mutant hTDP43 was expressed under the control of a prion protein promoter that drives the expression mainly in the mouse CNS and the male transgenic mice developed symptoms around 12 weeks of age while the female mice develop symptoms approximately 20 weeks of age. Therefore, Tg animals that are 50 days old were considered pre-symptomatic and 100 days old (Tg) animals were considered to be in the post-symptomatic stages of the disease for exon array experiments.   Age and sex matched pre and post-symptomatic transgenic animals and their wild type littermates were euthanised by cervical dislocation and tissues (brain and spinal cord) were harvested immediately for total RNA isolation experiments (n=3 per group). 200 ng of total RNA from transgenic TDP-43 mice and wild type animals was converted to cDNA and then amplified using the Applause WT-Amp Plus ST kit (NuGEN). Amplified cDNA was then fragmented and biotin labeled using the Encore Biotin Module kit (NuGEN) according to the manufacturer's instruction manual. Labelled cDNA was then hybridised onto Affymetrix GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST arrays in a hybridisation oven at 45 degrees C for 20 hours at 60rpm. After hybridization, washing and staining of the arrays were carried out using Affymetrix fluidics station 450 followed by scanning using GeneChip scanner. GeneChip Command Console Software (AGCC) controlled both the fluidics station and the scanner. CEL files generated by AGCC were uploaded onto Partek software and the data analysis was carried out using the exon array analysis workflow. Exon 1.0 ST arrays contain many more probes, which are classified into three major types based on their source. They are Core, extended and full probe set annotation. Core annotation refers the probe sets that are the most reliable of the three and is derived based on evidences from Refseq and GenBank. Extended annotations refer to probe sets that are generated based on EST sequences, ENSEMBL gene collections and other databases including those used for generating core probe sets. The full annotation refers to probe sets that are purely based on computational predictions. Core probe set annotation, unlike the extended or full annotation excludes the speculative probes reducing the incidence of false positives and was employed for exon array analysis. Alt-splice Anova, a statistical tool available in Partek was used for identifying novel alternative splicing events.

ECs from different vascular beds (arteries, capillaries, veins, lymphatics) resembled each other across tissues, but only arterial, venous and lymphatic (not capillary) ECs shared markers, illustrating a greater heterogeneity of capillary ECs. We identified high-endothelial-venule and lacteal-like ECs in the intestines, and angiogenic ECs in healthy tissues. Metabolic transcriptomes of ECs differed amongst spleen, lung, liver, brain and testis, while being similar for kidney, heart, muscle and intestines. Within tissues, metabolic gene expression was heterogeneous amongst ECs from different vascular beds, altogether highlighting large EC heterogeneity.

Muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA) and proportion of different fibre types are important determinants of muscle mass, function and overall metabolism.  Genetic variation plays a substantial role in phenotypic variation of these traits but the underlying genes remain poorly understood. We identified QTL associated with these muscle fibre phenotypes and hypothesized that if the phenotypic effect of the QTL was brought about by the allele specific abundance of transcripts encoded by genes within the QTL, such genes would be differentially expressed in the transcriptome between the parental strains. In this experiment, the expressed transcriptome in soleus muscle of mouse LG/J and SM/J strains was examined by measurement of gene expression on microarrays to facilitate nomination of candidate genes within identified QTL.

Maternally inherited factors play a key role in this critical developmental process, which occurs at the 2-cell stage in mice. Here we investigated the function of the maternally inherited factor STELLA (DPPA3) using single-cell/embryo approaches. This submission concerns itself with transcriptional profiling of wild type and Stella knockout (Stella-/-) oocytes, wild type and Stella maternal/zygotic knockout (StellaM/Z-/-) 1-cell and 2-cell embryos. We show that loss of maternal STELLA results in widespread transcriptional mis-regulation and a partial failure of MZT. Strikingly, activation of the LTR class of transposable elements (TE), and particularly 2-cell specific MuERV-L elements, is significantly impaired in StellaM/Z-/- embryos, which leads to a failure to upregulate selected chimeric transcripts. We propose that STELLA is involved in ensuring activation of TEs that themselves play a key role during early development, in part through regulating embryonic gene expression.

At this stage, the pluripotent cell population of the epiblast undergoes very rapid cellular proliferation and extensive epigenetic programming. Here, we show that Fam208a, a new epigenetic modifier, is essential for early post-implantation development using mouse strains harbouring two different allelic mutations. We show that at E6.5, Fam208a mutants have a decreased number of Oct4-positive epiblast cells due to an increase in p53-driven apoptosis. Complete removal of p53 could rescue the gastrulation block in Fam208a mutants, enabling them to develop until E8.5-9.0. The data demonstrates a new in vivo function of Fam208a in maintaining epiblast fitness thereby, making it an important factor at the onset of gastrulation.

Post-translational modifications dynamically alter protein function and so are ideally situated to regulate development. Here we show that the deubiquitylaying enzyme, Usp9x modulates both intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of mouse neural progenitors. Nestin-cre mediated deletion of Usp9x from neural progenitors results in a transient disruption of cell adhesion and apical-basal polarity as well as the premature differentiation of intermediate neural progenitors. Ablation of Usp9x also significantly increased beta-catenin protein levels, especially S33/S37/T41 phospho-beta-catenin, and Wnt signalling. Usp9x was found to be part of the beta-catenin destruction complex and loss of Usp9x affects destruction complex composition. Notch signalling was also increased in Usp9x ablated neural progenitors, coinciding with decreased Itch and Numb, and increased Notch intracellular domain protein levels. Usp9x co-localized and immunopreciptiated with Numb from neural progenitors suggesting it is required for Numb stabilisation. These data suggest Usp9x plays a role in coordinating intrinsic responses to extrinsic signals during neural development.

At the time of sex determination, Sry becomes up-regulated in XY gonads initiating the expression of various factors required for testicular development. Most of these factors remain to be identified. As a consequence, the genetic causes of gonadal dysgenesis in human patients, other than those involving SRY, remain unknown. We found that Nrg1 is a new gene involved in early testicular development. To study the role of Nrg1 in embryonic testicular differentiation, conditional inactivation of Nrg1 was achieved with the help of a Wt1-Cre line. Mutant mice show defects of testis development. In order to correlate the defects of cellular processes and the misregulated gene network(s), expression profiles were examined in controls and mutants testes at 13.5 dpc.

RNA-Seq is a powerful quantitative tool to explore genome wide expression. The aim of the present study is to provide a comprehensive RNA-Seq dataset across the same 13 tissues for mouse and rat, two of the most relevant species for biomedical research. The dataset provides the transcriptome across tissues from three male C57BL6 mice and three male Han Wistar rats. We also describe our bioinformatics pipeline to process and technically validate the data. Principal component analysis shows that tissue samples from both species cluster similarly. By comparative genomics we show that many genes with high sequence identity with respect to their human orthologues have also a highly correlated tissue distribution profile and are in agreement with manually curated literature data for human. These results make us confident that the present study provides a unique resource for comparative genomics and will facilitate the analysis of tissue specificity and cross-species conservation in higher organisms.

This protective effect was dependent on the Type I interferon receptor Ifnar. We performed transcriptional profiling to identify molecular mechanisms associated with protection from influenza infection in Irgm1-/- lung. Both male and female mice were used at 8-12 weeks of age. Lung gene expression was assessed by RNA-seq at the following times post-influenza infection: Day 3 (early time point, early histological damage present in control mice), Day 6 (intermediate time point, late histological damage present in control mice) and Day 10 (late time point, morbidity and mortality present in control mice).

To identify genes involved in this process, we carried out transcriptional analysis on murine hearts at different stages of development and adult mice with HF. Our screen identified 5-oxoprolinase (OPLAH), a member of the -Glutamyl cycle, that functions by scavenging 5-oxoproline. OPLAH depletion occurred as a result of cardiac injury, leading to elevated 5-oxoproline and oxidative stress, whereas OPLAH overexpression improved cardiac function after ischemic injury. In HF patients we observed elevated plasma 5-oxoproline levels, which were associated with a worse clinical outcome. Understanding and modulating fetal-like genes in the failing heart may lead to potential novel diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic options in HF.

To identify genes that are expressed in a wave-like pattern we dissected the PSM of four different mouse embryos (pre-turned), separated the left and right sides, and divided each into five segments, from posterior to anterior (sampling sites 1 to 5).

Excess abdominal adiposity is a major risk factor for metabolic disease in rodents and humans, while expansion of subcutaneous fat does not carry the same risks. Brown adipose produces heat as a defense against hypothermia and obesity, and the appearance of brown-like adipocytes within white adipose tissue depots is associated with improved metabolic phenotypes. Thus, understanding the differences in cell biology and function of these different adipose cell types and depots may be critical to the development of new therapies for metabolic disease. Here, we found that BEN, a determination factor of brown fat function. BEN transgenic mice displayed increased energy expenditure, limited weight gain, and improved glucose tolerance in response to a high-fat diet.

However, the underlying pathways are poorly defined. We sought to derive insights into the pathways regulating neonatal development of the mouse heart and cardiac regeneration post-MI. Total RNA-seq of mouse heart through the first 10 days of postnatal life (referred to as P3, P5, P10) revealed a previously unobserved transition in microRNA expression between P3 and P5 associated specifically with altered expression of protein-coding genes on the focal adhesion pathway and cessation of cardiomyocyte cell division. We found profound changes in the coding and non-coding transcriptome after neonatal MI, with evidence of essentially complete healing by P10. Over two thirds of each of the mRNAs, lncRNAs and microRNAs that were differentially expressed in the post-MI heart were differentially expressed during normal postnatal development, suggesting a common regulatory pathway for normal cardiac development and post-MI cardiac regeneration. We selected exemplars of miRNAs implicated in our data set as regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Several of these showed evidence of a functional influence on mouse cardiomyocyte cell division. In addition, a subset of these microRNAs, miR-144-3p, miR-195a-5p, miR-451a and miR-6240 showed evidence of functional conservation in human cardiomyocytes. The sets of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs that we report here merit further investigation as gatekeepers of cell division in the postnatal heart and as targets for extension of the period of cardiac regeneration beyond the neonatal period.

The homozygotes expressing AOX were viable and their median survival was extended from 210 to 590 days due to permanent prevention of lethal cardiomyopathy. AOX also prevented renal tubular atrophy and cerebral astrogliosis, but not liver disease, growth restriction, or lipodystrophy, suggesting distinct tissue-specific pathogenetic mechanisms. Cardiac mitochondrial ultrastructure, mitochondrial respiration, and pathological transcriptome and metabolome alterations were essentially normalized by AOX, showing that the restored electron flow upstream of cIII was sufficient to prevent cardiac energetic crisis and detrimental decompensation.

Oxidative stress has been suggested to induce mutations in mtDNA and as DNA is used as a template in transcription, mutations or 8-oxo-dG on DNA can induce GC>TA transversion accumulation in mtRNA. To verify this, we extracted and sequenced (Illumina) total RNA from heart Sod2 knockout mice alone and mice that were also deficient for mitochondrial base-excision repair. The repair deficiency was induced by removing the genomic region encoding for the predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence from endogenous OGG1 (L2 to W23) called Ogg1 dMTS mice, thus excluding the protein from mitochondria. OGG1 is a DNA glycosylase that recognizes and repairs 8-oxo-dG damage from DNA. Oxidative stress can induce 8-oxo-dG lesions, thus we removed the mitochondrial matrix localized superoxide dismutase (SOD2) from these mice to increase the level of oxidative stress. 8-oxo-dG lesion can be mutagenic because some DNA repair polymerases are known to erroneously incorporate adenosine opposite to 8-oxo-dG during replication leading to GC>TA transversion mutations.

This toxicity is consistent with the human symptoms of bilirubin toxicity. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of bilirubin toxicity we carried out whole genome gene expression analysis on gross brain regions (cortex, cerebellum and brainstem) and specific parts of the auditory pathway (MNTB and CN) at 2 hours, 4 hours and 24 hours post injection.

Regional heterogeneity of brain immunophenotypes was described under homeostasis, but a topographical resolution of CNS immune responses in chronic peripheral inflammatory diseases like RA is missing. We demonstrate regional heterogeneity of CNS susceptibility to chronic peripheral inflammation in the human tumor necrosis factor alpha transgenic (TNFtg) mouse model of RA. TNFtg mice showed myeloid cell infiltration, microglial activation, and a mutual transcriptomic fingerprint of neuroinflammation in the cortex, striatum, and thalamus. Immune responses were minimal in the hippocampus and cerebellum. We demonstrate regional CNS immune responses to chronic peripheral inflammation, sparing the hippocampus and cerebellum and reversible by peripheral anti-inflammatory treatment. Targeting microenvironmental susceptibility or resilience of brain regions will help to prevent and treat RA-related neuropsychiatric comorbidity. RNA-sequencing was performed from five brain regions (cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum) from C57Bl6/J wild type mice and TNFtg mice (strain Tg197; kindly provided by George Kollias (Fleming Institute, Vari, Greece).

NBSCs can be obtained by neural transcription factor-mediated reprogramming (BRN2, SOX2, KLF4, and ZIC3) of human adult dermal fibroblasts and peripheral blood cells (induced Neural Plate Border Stem Cells, iNBSCs) or by directed differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (NBSCs). Moreover, human (i)NBSCs share molecular and functional features with primary Neural Plate Border Stem Cells (pNBSCs) isolated from neural folds of E8.5 mouse embryos. Here we provide single cell RNA-sequencing data of neural tissue derived from two E8.5 mouse embryos. After manual isolation and enzymatic separation E8.5 neural tissue was single cell sorted and RNA sequencing was performed following the Smart-seq2 protocol. In sum, cultured pNBSCs and E8.5 neural tube cells share a similar regional identity and expression signature suggesting that pNBSCs might correspond to an endogenous progenitor in this area of the developing brain.

On the other hand, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has been ascertained multiple beneficial actions in the brain: neuro-development, -protection, -genesis and plasticity. To further investigate the possible mechanisms underlying IGF-1 deficiency in the establishment of neurological disease, microarray and RT-qPCR gene expression analyses coupled with in silico processing were performed in an experimental model of partial IGF-1 deficiency. Results show that the mere IGF-1 deficiency seems to be responsible for an altered expression of genes coding for neurotrophic factors (particularly ciliary neurotrophic factor and mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor), their receptors and signaling pathways (specially RET). The presented findings support that IGF-1 deficiency might be involved in the establishment and progression of neurodegenerative disorders.

The evolutionary advantage conferred by these rhythms could be their anticipatory properties. In the nervous system, anticipation is particularly interesting due to the spatiotemporal constraints derived by the highly compartmentalized neuronal structure. Previous work has confirmed that 900 genes are expressed in the mouse forebrain in robustly rhythmic fashion, and 180 transcripts are equally robustly circadian at the synapse. Interestingly, mRNAs are found in higher amounts at the end of the dark phase, and decrease exponentially during the first hours of light. This pattern resembles the "sawtooth" pattern of homeostatic sleep pressure. To further characterize this phenotype we propose to compare the synaptic transcriptome of sleep deprived mice to its control base line. This work would shed light into the emerging field of synaptic RNA transport and translation and its regulatory inputs. Hopefully, the results will yield to two different findings: the circadian and activity potential to regulate synaptic transport of RNA and the classification of transcripts deferentially regulated by both processes.

The goal of our study is to elucidate the molecular link of both signaling systems as well as the role of altered DNA damage responses in kidney degeneration and fibrosis. The kinase-regulated DNA damage response target Apoptosis Antagonizing Transcription Factor (Aatf) is a master regulator of the p53 response. Upon genetic deletion of Aatf in renal tubular cells we induce progressive renal failure and a phenotype closely resembling human nephronophthisis in mice and are able to show Aatf as a regulator of primary cilia and modulator of the DNA damage response connecting two pathogenetic concepts of nephronophthisis and nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies. The analysis of the RNA-sequencing of four Aatf-knockout mice and four wildtype mice supports the experimental findings.

Slc7a5 fl/fl mice harbouring two copies of the Slc7a5 targeted allele (exon 1 of Slc7a5 flanked with two loxP sites), were crossed with a mouse line ubiquitously expressing cre recombinase under the Bal1 promoter (Bal1-cre) to obtain a global Slc7a5 knockout mouse (Poncet et al. 2014 PLoS One 9: e89547). Heterozygous Slc7a5+/- C57Bl/6 mice were viable and fertile and were bred free of Bal1-cre in subsequent generations. Slc7a5 -/- embryos were obtained by inter-crossing heterozygotes and a phenotype was apparent by E9.5. To identify the first cellular processes affected by Slc7a5 loss RNAseq was carried out to compare transcriptomes of null and wildtype E8.5 embryos.

In the week after birth, the mammalian heart goes through distinct stages of cell cycle progression and differentiation that govern the development of the mature adult CM phenotype. By establishing the fundamental framework of the molecular signals governing these early events after birth, a potential treatment strategy that restores the heart's ability to proliferate, and in theory, undergo "repair" after injury could be developed. At 0 days (d), 1d, 3d, 5d, 7d, 10d, and 15d after birth, hearts from C57BL/6J wild-type mice were excised and processed for total RNA isolation.

These renal cysts are reminiscent of Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD). How BICC1 is involved in the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease is still unknown. Recent studies highlighted that HNF4A plays a role in the regulation of metabolic pathways deregulated in this renal disease. Moreover, Menezes et al. [2012, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003053] showed that combined kidney inactivation of Hnf4a and Pkd1 in mice significantly worsened the cystic phenotype. Here we investigated whether the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of HNF4A might be deregulated in kidneys from Bicc1 mouse model of polycystic kidney disease. HNF4A, H3K27ac, H3K4me1 ChIPseq experiments were performed in kidneys from male and female Bicc1 WT and KO mice. From the contralateral kidneys of the same animals used for the ChIPseq experiments, the total RNA was extracted for gene expression profiling by RNAseq. The RNAseq data was used to support the ChIP-seq analysis and to reveal deregulated pathways in BICC1 mutants.

We found synapse loss in the hippocampus of GNE+/- mice at 6 months followed by a gradual loss of neurons in the hippocampus and substantia nigra at 12 months. Moreover, GNE+/- mice showed reduced arborization of microglia already at 6 months. A transcriptomic analysis revealed only minor inflammatory changes with slightly increased Interleukin 1   levels, indicating a homeostatic removal of synapses and neurons. Crossbreeding with complement component 3-deficient mice rescued the early onset loss of neurons and synapses in the GNE+/- mice. Thus, an intact sialic acid covered glycocalyx plays an essential role in maintaining brain homeostasis. Even a minor reduction in the sialic acid level leads to reduced microglial arborization and complement-mediated loss of neurons and synapses.

We aimed to define the pathobiology underlying UFS which we hypothesised would illuminate how the bladder becomes innervated. Lrig2 was detected in pelvic ganglia supplying autonomic neurons to the bladder, and in neurites and glia emanating from explanted ganglia. One week old Lrig2 mutant mice displayed abnormally patterned bladder nerves, as did mice with mutations of Hpse2, also mutated in some UFS patients. From two weeks postnatally, Lrig2 mutants had urination defects resembling UFS. Molecules implicated in neural biology, including Nos1 which relaxes the bladder outlet, were dysregulated in newborn Lrig2 mutant bladders. These molecular aberrations preceded manifest urination defects. We discovered novel homozygous missense LRIG2 variants in non-syndromic bladder outlet obstruction. Molecules mutated in UFS are required for bladder innervation and LRIG2 variants can occur in non-syndromic bladder disease as well as in UFS.

Considerable attention has been paid to the reduced harm potential of alternative nicotine-containing inhalable products such as e-cigarettes. We investigated the effects of E-vapor aerosols or cigarette smoke (CS) on atherosclerosis progression, cardiovascular function, and molecular changes in the heart and aorta of female ApoE-/- mice. The mice were exposed to aerosols from three different E-vapor formulations: (1) carrier (propylene glycol and vegetable glycerol), (2) base (carrier and nicotine) or (3) test (base and flavor) or to CS from 3R4F reference cigarettes for up to 6 months. Concentrations of CS and base or test aerosols were matched at 35  g nicotine/L. Exposure to CS, compared with sham-exposed fresh air controls, accelerated atherosclerotic plaque formation, while no such effect was seen for any of the three E-vapor aerosols. Molecular changes indicated disease mechanisms related to oxidative stress and inflammation in general, plus changes in calcium regulation, and altered cytoskeletal organization and microtubule dynamics in the left ventricle. While ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiac output, and isovolumic contraction time remained unchanged following E-vapor aerosols exposure, the nicotine-containing base and test aerosols caused an increase in isovolumic relaxation time similar to CS. A nicotine-related increase in pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness was also observed, but it was significantly lower for base and test aerosols than for CS. These results demonstrate that in comparison with CS, E-vapor aerosols induce substantially lower biological responses associated with smoking-related cardiovascular diseases.

MATR3 is an ALS-linked gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein that is involved in alternative splicing regulation. S85C is the most commonly identified mutation in MATR3. We generated MATR3 S85C knock-in mice (of the C57BL/6 background) as a model to study ALS pathogenesis and we found that homozygous S85C mice begin to show phenotypes at around 10 weeks of age. To investigate the molecular changes that may contribute to the behavioural deficits and neurodegeneration observed in homozygous S85C mice, we performed RNA-seq on cortex, cerebellum and lumbar spinal cord tissue of wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous S85C mice (4 females per genotype) at the early symptomatic stage (8-10 weeks old). Total RNA was extracted and sent to SickKids TCAG core for mRNA library preparation, which were paired end (100 bp in length) sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq S1 flow cell.

CELLO-seq allows for full-length RNA sequencing and enables measurement of allelic, isoform and Transposable Element (TE) expression at unique loci. We use CELLO-seq to assess the widespread expression of TEs in 2-cell mouse blastomeres as well as human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Across both species, old and young TEs showed evidence of locus-specific expression, with simulations demonstrating that only a small number of very young elements in the mouse could not be mapped back to with high confidence. Exploring the relationship between the expression of individual elements and putative regulators revealed surprising heterogeneity, with TEs within a class showing different patterns of correlation, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms. CELLO-seq thus represents a significant advance in the research of TEs, highlighting that studying TEs in single cells and at single loci resolution is necessary for understanding how such elements are regulated and for gaining insight into their role during development.

We perform in vivo antibody-independent ChIP-sequencing of endogenously-expressed REVERBalpha, in order to map its cistrome and so define its repressive targets. We find that REVERBalpha binding sites harbour consensus RORE or RevDR2 motifs, and overlap with corepressor complex binding, without over-representation of putative tethering factors. When Reverbalpha is deleted in a hepatocyte-selective fashion, only modest physiological and transcriptional effects are seen, with de-repressed target genes tightly associating with REVERBalpha binding sites. Thus, contrary to previous reports, REVERBalpha does not repress lipogenesis under basal conditions. REVERBalpha control of a more extensive transcriptional programme is revealed only by perturbation (the metabolically abnormal global Reverbalpha-/- mouse, or acutely mistimed feeding), supporting instead a role for this core clock protein in buffering against metabolic challenge.

Female mice have been widely used in multiple studies on pubertal development as they present the similar molecular behaviors in HPG axis and stable cycles of menstrual calendar like human. Hypothalamic ARC underwent a huge epigenetic and genetic reprogramming to adapt to the response and feedback on sexual hormones during the stages of early pubertal (2-5-week of age) and late puberty (5-8-week of age) . We harvested 4- and 8-week hypothalamic ARC and employed RNA-seq, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and hydroxymethylation profiling (RRHP) on a genome-wide scale.

Elegans|Calorie restriction is a major intervention consistently demonstrated to retard aging and delay age-associated diseases. A novel micronutrient blend, a putative calorie restriction mimetic, was developed based on a screening tool we previously described. Whole transcriptomic analysis was examined in brain cortex, skeletal muscle and heart in three groups of mice: old controls (30 months), old + calorie restriction and old + novel micronutrient blend. The micronutrient blend elicited transcriptomic changes in a manner similar to those in the calorie-restricted group and unique from those in the control group. Subgroup analysis revealed that nuclear hormone receptor, proteasome complex and angiotensinogen genes, all of which are known to be directly related to the aging process, were the most affected by the micronutrient blend and by calorie restriction. Thus, these three genes may be considered master regulators of the favorable effects of calorie restriction and of the micronutrient blend. Based on the calorie restriction mimetic effects on transcriptomics, it was hypothesized that the micronutrient blend would promotes longevity and vitality. To test this hypothesis, a functional analysis in C. Elegans was used to examine the effects of the micronutrient blend on longevity and biomarkers of vitality. Results indicate that feeding C. Elegans the micronutrient blend increased longevity as well as vitality. Further studies are required to confirm that the calorie restriction mimicking benefits described here are elicited by the micronutrient blend in humans.

Historically, cancer research has focused on histological and molecular characterisation of established tumours, which has led to the identification of hundreds of putative driver mutations. It is currently unclear how these genetic aberrations impact the cell state of nascent tumour cells and their microenvironment. BRCA1 driven triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) for example has been shown to arise from luminal progenitor cells1,2 yet little is known about how BRCA1 loss-of-function (LOF) and concomitant mutations affect the luminal progenitor cell state. Here we demonstrate how time-resolved single-cell profiling of genetically engineered mouse models before tumour formation can address this challenge. We found that the perturbation of Brca1/p53 in luminal progenitors induces an aberrant alveolar differentiation pre-malignancy. Unlike alveolar differentiation occurring during gestation, this process is cell autonomous and characterised by the dysregulation of transcription factors driving alveologenesis. Our experimental approach has allowed us to further identify responses in the stromal and immune cell compartments during the early steps of tumourigenesis. Based on our data we propose a model where transcriptional and epigenetic changes driven by Brca1/p53 inadvertently promote a differentiation program hardwired in luminal progenitors, highlighting the deterministic role of the cell of origin and offering a potential explanation for the tissue specificity of BRCA1 tumours.  Moving forward, the phenotype identified herein should be evaluated as a target for early detection and treatment of TNBC.

Yet, underlying mechanisms are not understood, and no validated therapy or prevention exists.  NADPH oxidases (NOX), are important sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cochlea and might therefore be involved in the pathogenesis of ARHL. Here we investigate ARHL in a mouse model. Wild type mice showed early loss of hearing and cochlear integrity, while animals deficient in the NOX subunit p22phox remained unaffected up to six months. Genes of the excitatory pathway were down-regulated in p22phox-deficient auditory neurons. Our results demonstrate that NOX activity leads to upregulation of genes of the excitatory pathway, to excitotoxic cochlear damage, and ultimately to ARHL. In the absence of functional NOXs, aging mice conserve hearing and cochlear morphology. Our study offers new insights into pathomechanisms and future therapeutic targets of ARHL.

A mist of piRNA biogenesis is the identification of the 3'-5' exnuclease that trimms the 3' end of piRNA intermediates to form mature piRNAs in mammals. Here, we show that mice deficient for PNLDC1, an evolutionarily conserved 3'-5' exonuclease, accumulate 3' untrimmed piRNA intermediates of 30~40nt. These 3' extended piRNA intermediates associate with PIWI proteins, but are impaired for function. Male Pnldc1 knockout mice display LINE1 derepression and are sterile owing to chimeric spermatogenetic arrest at spermatocyte and spermatid stages. Our findings illustrate the conserved role of mouse Pnldc1 in 3' trimming during piRNA maturation. However, since Pnldc1 knockout in mice creates phenotypes distinct from its reported interactive partner, Tdrkh, the panorama of participants in mammalian piRNA 3' end maturation may be more complex than previously speculated.

While cessation remains the most effective approach to minimize smoking-related disease, alternative non-combustible tobacco-derived nicotine containing products may reduce disease risks among those unable or unwilling to quit. E-vapor aerosols typically contain significantly lower levels of smoke-related harmful and potentially harmful constituents; however, health risks of long-term inhalation exposures are unknown. We designed a 7-month inhalation study in C57BL/6 mice to evaluate long-term respiratory toxicity of e-vapor aerosols compared to cigarette smoke and to assess the impact of smoking cessation or switching to an e-vapor product after 3 months of exposure to 3R4F cigarette smoke (CS). There were no significant changes in in-life observations (body weights, clinical signs) in e-vapor groups compared to the Sham Control. The 3R4F CS group showed reduced respiratory function during exposure and had lower body weight and showed transient signs of distress post-exposure. Following 7 months of exposure, e-vapor aerosols resulted in no or minimal increase in pulmonary inflammation, while exposure to 3R4F CS led to impairment of lung function and caused marked lung inflammation and emphysematous changes. Biological changes observed in the Switching group were similar to the Cessation group. 3R4F CS exposure dysregulated lung and nasal tissue transcriptome, while these molecular effects were substantially lower in the e-vapor group. Results from this study demonstrate that in comparison with 3R4F CS, e-vapor aerosols induce substantially lower biological responses including pulmonary inflammation and emphysema, and that complete switching from CS to e-vapor products significantly reduces biological changes associated with cigarette smoke in C57BL/6 mice.

To assess if cigarette smoke (CS)-induced disease endpoints would be similar after exposure in either system, we exposed apolipoprotein E-deficient mice to the same target total particulate matter concentration of mainstream smoke from 3R4F reference cigarettes in NO or WB exposure chambers (EC) for 2 months, and as controls to filtered air (Sham).  While CS was reproducibly delivered to both exposure systems, we observed higher nicotine and formaldehyde concentrations being delivered to NOECs than to WBECs, but similar concentrations of carbon monoxide, acetaldehyde, and acrolein.  CS exposure led to the adaptive changes expected in nasal epithelia, altered lung function, increased lung inflammation, and pronounced changes in the nasal epithelial transcriptome and lung proteome. Exposure in the NOEC caused generally more pronounced or severe  respiratory effects and a higher stress response. Body weight, in particular, was much lower in mice exposed in the NOEC. Aortic arch imaging revealed greater plaque area in CS-exposed mice in the WBEC group than in the respective sham group. No difference was found in aortic plaque size between CS-exposed mice in the NOEC and sham groups. As CS is a chemically and temporarily dynamic aerosol, its composition in the breathing zone was not completely comparable between the two exposure systems; however, the main disease endpoints and exposure effects were largely induced in both systems. NO exposure appeared to be more stressful for the mice than WB exposure.

Eye-specified neuroepithelium forms the optic cup in which spatial separation of three domains is established, namely, the region of multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), the ciliary margin zone (CMZ) possessing both neurogenic and non-neurogenic potential, and the optic disc (OD), the interface between the optic stalk and the neuroretina. Here, we show by genetic ablation in the developing optic cup that Meis1 and Meis2 homeobox genes function redundantly to maintain the retinal progenitor pool while they simultaneously suppress the expression of genes characteristic of CMZ and OD fates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Meis transcription factors bind the regulatory regions of RPC-, CMZ-, and OD-specific genes, thus providing a mechanistic insight into the Meis-dependent gene regulatory network. Our work uncovers the essential role of Meis1 and Meis2 as regulators of cell fate competence and guardians of spatial territories in the vertebrate eye.

FUS mutations disrupting its nuclear localization characterize a subset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS-FUS) patients, through an unidentified pathological mechanism. FUS regulates nuclear RNA, but its role at the synapse is poorly understood. Here, we used super-resolution imaging to determine the physiological localization of extranuclear, neuronal FUS and found it predominantly near the vesicle reserve pool of presynaptic sites. Using CLIP-seq on synaptoneurosome preparations, we identified synaptic RNA targets of FUS that are associated with synapse organization and plasticity. Synaptic FUS was significantly increased in a knock-in mouse model of ALS-FUS, at presymptomatic stages. Despite apparently unaltered synaptic organization, RNA-seq of synaptoneurosomes highlighted age-dependent dysregulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Our study indicates that FUS relocalization to the synapse in early stages of ALS-FUS results in synaptic impairment, potentially representing an initial trigger of neurodegeneration.

We have used this approach to characterize the transcriptional profile of individual hepatocytes with different levels of ploidy. This method has the potential to explore archived samples, for instance to study the development and progression of disease in complex tissues. To illustrate the potential of this method, we have deeply characterized the cellular heterogeneity driven by spatial distribution and different levels of ploidy in the young adult mouse liver.

NaR were dissected from two to 11 C57Bl6 mice (of both sexes) per stage.  Mouse 3D-RA were generated from the iPSC Nrl-GFP line. Cells from NaR and OV were dissociated and subjected to droplet-based scRNA-Seq using a 10X Genomics Chromium platform.  We obtained sequence information for 21,249 cells from NaR and 16,842 cells from 3D-RA, distributed evenly amongst developmental stages. We generated an average of 74,808 reads per cell, corresponding to 5,940 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and 2,471 genes per cell.

Furthermore, the proven endocrine and thermogenic functions of adipocytes have renewed interest in the study of this tissue, as the activation of non-shivering thermogenesis may hold great potential for the future treatment of obesity and T2D. Cold exposure has defined to activate this process.  Here, the miRNA transcriptomic response of epididymal and inguinal white adipose depots (eWAT and iWAT, respectively) as well as that of the interscapular brown adipose depot (iBAT) of C57Bl/6 mice either exposed to 22 C or 4 C for the period of 4 days were examined.  This in-detail study of the adaptation of each depot to cold exposure has allowed unraveling depot-specific regulatory molecular mechanisms.

To do that we isolate intestinal crypts from wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO, Mmp17-/-) mice, and obtained clean strips of smooth muscle. After muscle dissociation, we obtained RNA directly from crypts and muscle, and it was used for RNA-seq.  By comparing WT and KO samples we observed a higher impact in gene expression affecting crypts, even though MMP17 is only expressed in muscle. This helped us to identify altered signaling pathways in KO crypts that linked MMP17 with SMAD4 and BMP signaling.

NMPs reside in the caudal lateral epiblast and tailbud, from where they sustain axial elongation. HOX transcription factors have been historically implicated in axial elongation, with their sequential activation playing a fundamental role in timing PM development. PBX1 and PBX2 are obligate anterior HOX cofactors, and therefore they represent prominent candidates for controlling the distinct response to individual HOX factors. To pinpoint the role of PBX proteins in the development of pre-somitic mesoderm, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on cells isolated from the tailbuds of control, Pbx1/Pbx2 compound (Pbx1/2-com) and Pbx1/Pbx2 double-mutant (Pbx1/2-DKO) embryos at embryonic days 8.5 and 9.0. Single cells from at least three embryos per genotype and stage were FACS-sorted into 384-well capture plates, and scRNA-seq was performed using MARS-seq (Jaitin D.A. et al., Science, 343, 776-779 (2014)). As a spike-in internal control for batch-effect correction, 71 EpiSCs cultivated in vitro were sorted into each plate, together with 311 cells from embryonic tailbuds. Two wells were left empty in each plate, as a no-cell control during data analysis.

To validate cell2location in real tissue, we applied the model to data from the mouse brain, which features diverse neural cell types organised in a well characterised spatial architecture across brain areas, thus presenting a canonical use case to test spatial genomics. We generated matched single nucleus (sn, this submission) and Visium spatial RNA-seq (10X Genomics) profiles of adjacent mouse brain sections that contain multiple regions from the telencephalon and diencephalon. To assess the biological and intra-organ technical variation in spatial mapping, we assayed two mouse brains and serial tissue sections from each brain (total of 3 and 2 matched sections from two animals, respectively, and an extra section for snRNA-seq), creating a rich multi-modal and replicated transcriptomic dataset.  Tissue processing. Brains of wild-type adult C57BL/6 mice (postnatal day 56, 1 female and 1 male) were dissected, snap frozen, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek) and stored at -80oC. Brain hemispheres were cryosectioned at -20oC using a cryostat (Leica, CM3050S). To assess tissue quality, RNA was extracted from test tissue sections using the RNeasy Pico Kit (Qiagen) and yielded high RIN values (9.6 and 9.7) on an Agilent Bioanalyser, indicating high RNA quality.  For matched single nuclei and Visium RNA-seq experiments, brain hemispheres were cryosectioned to adjacent thick (200  m) and thin (10  m) coronal sections, respectively, and processed the same day. In total, four consecutive sets of thick and thin tissue sections were collected from each brain. Five sets of tissue sections yielded both good quality single nuclei and Visium data (three adjacent sections from mouse 1 and two sections from mouse 2) while one additional section from mouse 2 yielded good single nuclei; these were considered for analysis in this study.   Single nucleus RNA-sequencing. Thick (200  m) mouse brain sections were cryosectioned, dissected from OCT and kept in a tube on dry ice until subsequent processing. Nuclei were extracted from each section as described previously. Briefly, nuclei were released from sections via Dounce homogenisation, Hoechst-stained, and isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Nuclei were then loaded into the 10X Chromium Single Cell 3' Kit (v3) to obtain 3,000-7,000 nuclei per well, and library preparation was done per manufacturer's protocol. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq S4 system.  Sequencing data were processed using 10X CellRanger version 3.0.2, aligned to mouse pre-mRNA genome reference version mm10 and mRNA count matrices were generated by adding intronic and exonic unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts for each gene in each cell. Initially, snRNA-seq counts were processed using standard Seurat V3 workflow without correcting batch effects between 6 individual samples.
