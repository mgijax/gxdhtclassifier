Urogenital tract malformations are the most common birth defects in males and their incidence together with other male reproductive health concerns such as reduced fertility and testicular cancer are reportedly on the rise in the human population. To better understand the impact of genetic factors and environmental influences on testicular development, it is important to first understand normal gene expression patterns and signaling cascades within the fetal testis during development. The goal of this study is to identify cell-specific genes that can be used as biomarkers for key differentiation events. ..

Yes|GSE640|Done|Baseline|transcription profiling by array|2019-02-18|225|1702|Transcription profiling of mouse testises at different developmental stages and cultures enriched in mouse Sertoli or interstitial cells to identify genes expressed differentially in meiotic or postmeiotic spermatogenic cells|A multitude of genes expressed solely in meiotic or postmeiotic spermatogenic cells offers a myriad of contraceptive targets. Understanding mammalian spermatozoan development and the events surrounding fertilization has grown slowly, in part because of uncertainty about the number and identity of the cellular components involved. Determination of those transcripts expressed specifically by germ cells should provide an inclusive list of probable critical proteins. Here, total mouse testis transcript profiles were trimmed of transcripts found in cultures enriched in Sertoli or interstitial cells to yield a germ cell-enriched transcript profile. Monitoring of changes of this profile in the developing testis identified 1,652 genes whose transcript abundance increased markedly coincident with the onset of meiosis. Remarkably, 351 of these genes ( approximately 20%) appear to be expressed only in the male germline. Germ cell-specific transcripts are much less common earlier in testis development. Further analysis of the UniGene EST database coupled with quantitative PCR indicates that approximately 4% of the mouse genome is dedicated to expression in postmeiotic male germ cells. Most or many of the protein products of these transcripts are probably retained in mature spermatozoa. Targeted disruption of 19 of these genes has indicated that a majority have roles critical for normal fertility. Thus, we find an astonishing number of genes expressed specifically by male germ cells late in development. This extensive group provides a plethora of potential targets for germ cell-directed contraception and a staggering number of candidate proteins that could be critical for fertilization. .. none;  total RNA;  1 day old testis;  11 day old testis;  14 day old testis;  18 day old testis;  19 day old testis, interstitial cells;  19 day old testis, tubular somatic cells;  21 day old testis;  26 day old testis;  29 day old testis;  4 day old testis;  8 day old testis;  adult testis;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Yes|GSE3554|Done|Baseline|transcription profiling by array|2017-02-15|101|2153|Transcription profiling by array of DBA/2J mouse model of glaucoma with elevated intraocular pressure|Purpose: The DBA/2J mouse is a model for secondary angle-closure glaucoma due to iris atrophy and pigment dispersion, which ultimately leads to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). We sought to correlate changes in retinal gene expression with glaucoma-like pathology by performing microarray analysis of retinal RNA from DBA/2J mice at 3 months before disease onset, and at 8 months, after IOP elevation. Methods: IOP was monitored monthly in DBA/2J animals by Tono-Pen and animals with normal (3 months) or elevated IOP (8 months) were identified. RNA was prepared from 3 individual retinas at each age, and the RNA was amplified and used to generate biotin-labeled probe for high density mouse Affymetrix arrays (U430.2). A subset of genes was selected for confirmation by quantitative RT-PCR using independent retina samples from DBA/2J animals at 3, 5 and 8 months of age, and compared to retinas from C57BL/6J control animals at 3 and 8 months. Results: There were changes in expression of 68 genes, with 32 genes increasing and 36 genes decreasing at 8 months versus 3 months. Upregulated genes were associated with immune response, glial activation, signaling and gene expression, while down-regulated genes included multiple crystallin genes. Significant changes in 9 upregulated genes and 2 downregulated genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, with some showing changes in expression by 5 months. Conclusions: DBA/2J retina shows evidence for glial activation and an immune-related response following IOP elevation, similar to what has been reported following acute elevation of IOP in other models.  IOP was monitored monthly in DBA/2J animals by Tono-Pen and animals with normal (3 months) or elevated IOP (8 months) were identified. RNA was prepared from 3 individual retinas at each age, and the RNA was amplified and used to generate biotin-labeled probe for high density mouse Affymetrix arrays (U430.2).

Yes|GSE3843|Done|WT vs. Mutant|transcription profiling by array|2018-11-14|128|2289|Transcription profiling of liver from wild type vs glycerol kinase knockout mice to understand the molecular pathogenesis of GKD|Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is an X-linked inborn error of metabolism with metabolic and neurologic crises. Liver shows the highest level of glycerol kinase (GK) activity in humans and mice. Absence of genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with GKD indicate the involvement of modifier genes, including other network partners. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of GKD, we performed microarray analysis on liver mRNA from neonatal glycerol kinase (Gyk) knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. Unsupervised learning revealed the overall gene expression profile of the KO mice was different from that of WT. Real time PCR confirmed differences for selected genes. Functional gene enrichment analysis was used to find 56 increased and 37 decreased gene functional categories. Pathway Assist analysis identified changes in gene expression levels of genes involved in organic acid metabolism indicating that GK was part of the same metabolic network which correlates well with the patients with GKD having metabolic acidemia during their episodic crises. Network component analysis (NCA) showed that transcription factors SREBP-1c, ChREBP, HNF-4alpha, and PPAR-alpha, had increased activity in the Gyk KO mice compared with WT mice; while SREBP-2 was less active in the Gyk KO mice. These studies show that Gyk deletion causes alterations in gene expression of genes in several regulatory networks and is the first time NCA has been used to expand on microarray data from a mouse knockout model of a human disease. Male WT and KO mouse pups were sacrificed on day of life (dol) 3 and each liver was harvested. Total RNA from 4 KO and 4 WT livers was isolated individually. cDNA was synthesized from the poly(A)+ mRNA in the total RNA, Biotin-tagged and fragmented to an average strand length of 100 bases (range 35-200 bases). Ten   g of each cRNA was hybridized onto an Affymetrix mus 430 2.0 GeneChip to analyze differences in liver gene expression between KO and WT mice. Day of life three was chosen because the mice are phenotypically symptomatic with statistically different parameters for hypoglycemia, acidosis; low bicarbonate and decreased base excess.

Here we show that caloric restriction suppresses apoptotic cell death in the mouse cochlea and prevents late onset of presbycusis. Caloric restricted mice, which maintained body weight at the same level as that of young control (YC) mice, retained normal hearing and showed no cochlear degeneration. CR mice also showed significantly fewer TUNEL-positive staining cells and fewer cleaved caspase-3-positive staining cells relative to middle-age control (MC) mice. Microarray analysis revealed that CR down-regulated the expression of 28 proapoptotic genes, including Bak and Bim. Taken together, our findings suggest that loss of critical cells through apoptosis is an important mechanism of presbycusis in mammals, and that CR or staying lean can retard this process by suppressing apoptosis in the inner ear tissue. Experiment Overall Design: To examine the effects of aging, a comparison of cochlea tissues from YC (3 samples) and MC (3 samples) mice was conducted. To examine the effects of calorie restriction (CR), a comparison of cochleae from MC (3 samples) and CR (3 samples) mice was conducted. We examined age-related changes in gene expression in the cochlea and calorie restriction-induced changes in gene expression in the cochlea.

Whether this response; represents simple hyperplasia of various liver elements; or requires recapitulation of the genetic program of; the developing liver is not known. To study these possibilities, we examined transcriptional programs of adult liver after partial hepatectomy and contrasted these with developing embryonic liver. Principal component analysis demonstrated that the time series of gene expression during liver regeneration does not segregate according to developmental transcription patterns. Gene ontology analysis revealed that liver restoration after hepatectomy and liver development differ dramatically with regard to transcription factors and chromatin structure modification. In contrast, the tissues are similar with regard to proliferationassociated genes. Consistent with these findings, realtime polymerase chain reaction showed transcription factors known to be important in liver development are not induced during liver regeneration. These three lines of evidence suggest that at a transcriptional level, restoration of liver mass after injury is best described as hepatocyte hyperplasia and not true regeneration. We speculate this novel pattern of gene expression may underlie the unique capacity of the liver to repair itself after injury. Experiment Overall Design: In order to elucidate the molecular similarities between regenerating and developing liver, we performed high-density microarray analysis using Affymetrix MG 430 2.0 chips for targets at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 48, and 72 hours after partial hepatectomy and at 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, and 16.5 days post conception (dpc).

In addition, serum IGF-1 levels have been correlated to both BMD and fracture risk.  We previously identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) for Bone Mineral Density (BMD) on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 6 that overlaps a QTL for serum IGF-1.  The B6.C3H-6T (6T) congenic mouse is homozygous for C57BL/6J (B6) alleles across the genome except for a 30 cM region on Chr 6 that is homozygous for C3H/HeJ (C3H) alleles.  This mouse was created to study biology behind both the BMD and the serum IGF-1 QTLs and to identify the gene(s) underlying these QTLs.   Female 6T mice have lower BMD and lower serum IGF-1 levels at all ages measured. As the liver is the major source of serum IGF-1, we examined differential expression in the livers of fasted female B6 and 6T mice by microarray.

Transcriptional deregulation and altered energy metabolism have been implicated in HD pathogenesis. We report here that mutant huntingtin causes disruption of mitochondrial function by inhibiting expression of PGC-1a, a transcriptional coactivator that regulates several metabolic processes including mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration.  Mutant huntingtin represses PGC-1a  gene transcription by associating with the promoter and interfering with the CREB/TAF4-dependent transcriptional pathway critical for the regulation of PGC-1a gene expression.  Crossbreeding of PGC-1a knockout mice with HD knock-in mice leads to increased neurodegeneration of striatal neurons and motor abnormalities in the HD mice.  Importantly, expression of PGC-1a partially reverses the toxic effects of mutant huntingtin in cultured striatal neurons.  Moreover, lentiviral-mediated delivery of PGC-1a in the striatum provides neuroprotection in the transgenic HD mice.  These studies suggest a key role for PGC-1a in the control of energy metabolism in the early stages of HD pathogenesis.

It has been suggested that MTf is involved in a variety of processes such as Fe metabolism and cellular differentiation. Considering the crucial role of Fe in many metabolic pathways e.g., DNA synthesis, it is important to understand the function of MTf. To define the roles of MTf, a MTf knockout (MTf -/-) mouse model was developed. Examination of the MTf -/- mice demonstrated no phenotypic differences compared to wild-type littermates.

At this age testicular cell composition is still comparable in SCARKOs and controls. Microarray analysis identified 692 genes with significant differences in expression. A more than 2-fold up- or downregulation by androgen action in Sertoli cells was observed for 28 and 6 genes respectively. The biological relevance of the ""strongly"" upregulated genes was supported by the finding that several of them were previously described to be androgen-regulated or essential for spermatogenesis. Serine protease inhibitors were overrepresented in the same subgroup suggesting a role for androgens in cell junction dynamics and tissue restructuring events during spermatogenesis. A time course experiment (d8-d20), followed by cluster analysis allowed the identification of typical expression patterns of differentially expressed testicular genes during initiation of spermatogenesis. Three genes with a pattern closely resembling that of Pem, a prototypal androgen-regulated gene in Sertoli cells, were selected for confirmation by RT-PCR and further analysis. The data confirm that the SCARKO model allows identification of novel androgen-regulated genes in the testis. This particular series represents  all data from  d 10. The additional expression data from the time course (d8-d20) is represented by series GSE2259 (Testicular gene expression in SCARKO mice during prepuberty).

Several SCD isoforms (SCD1-3) exist in the mouse. Here we show that mice with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 isoform have reduced body adiposity, increased insulin sensitivity, and are resistant to diet-induced weight gain. The protection from obesity involves increased energy expenditure and increased oxygen consumption. Compared with the wild-type mice the SCD1-/- mice have increased levels of plasma ketone bodies but reduced levels of plasma insulin and leptin. In the SCD1-/- mice, the expression of several genes of lipid oxidation are up-regulated, whereas lipid synthesis genes are down-regulated. These observations suggest that a consequence of SCD1 deficiency is an activation of lipid oxidation in addition to reduced triglyceride synthesis and storage. Experiment Overall Design: RNA was isolated from livers of 10 individual 6-week-old female mice by using a standard method. Mouse genome U74A arrays were used to monitor the expression level of approximately 10,000 genes and expressed sequence tags (Affymetrix).

Transcription factors and Brg1/Brm-associated factor (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex interactions suggest potential mechanisms, but the role of BAF complexes in cardiogenesis is not known. Here we show that dosage of Brg1 is critical for mouse and zebrafish cardiogenesis. Disrupting the balance between Brg1 and disease-causing cardiac transcription factors, including Tbx5, Tbx20, and Nkx2-5, causes severe cardiac anomalies, revealing an essential allelic balance between Brg1 and these cardiac transcription factor genes. This suggests that relative levels of transcription factors and BAF complexes are important for heart development, which is supported by reduced occupancy of Brg1 at cardiac genes in Tbx5 haploinsufficient hearts. Our results reveal complex dosage-sensitive interdependence between transcription factors and BAF complexes, providing a potential mechanism underlying transcription factor haploinsufficiency, with implications for multigenic inheritance of CHDs.

JNK3 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system and it plays a crucial role in neuronal death in several neurodegenerative diseases, including epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. By contrast, the isoforms JNK1 and JNK2 seem to be involved in brain development. The lack of Jnk3 gene confers neuroprotection, although the specific mechanism underlying this has yet to be elucidated. The present study analyze the gene expression profiling in mice lacking Jnk3, comparing them to wild-type mice. The microarray analysis showed that 22 genes are differentially expressed in Jnk3 null mice. Of these we focused in pik3cb, since it is directly related to the pro-survival PI3K/AKT pathway. Results from Jnk3 null mice showed an increase in pik3cb transcript, together with an increase in PI3K activity and hyperphosphorylation of AKT. By contrast, these changes were not observed in Jnk1 null mice, indicating that activation of PI3K/AKT pathway is specifically related to the lack of JNK3. The data obtained in this study demonstrates activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in Jnk3 null mice through the increase of pik3cb transcript.  We performed arrays from Jnk3 null mice respect wilde-type mice. For each experiment (sample) a RNA pool from hippocampus form three different mice were used. Moreover, a second independent hybridization were done with new sample of RNA (sample 2).

In order to determine the role of P2Y13 in lipoprotein metabolism in vivo, we ablated the expression of this gene in mice and found that P2Y13 knockout mice have lower plasma HDL (17%) and LDL (27%) levels as well as lower fecal concentrations of neutral sterols. In addition, significant decreases were detected in serum levels of fatty acids, glycerol and triglycerides in P2Y13 knockout mice. mRNA profiling analyses showed that ablation of P2Y13 affects hepatic gene expression in a gender-specific manner.  Non-supervised agglomerative cluster analysis showed that expression changes in mice with the same genotype (KO or WT) cluster together and that distinct gene expression clusters can be observed for males and females.

It is now well documented that Dicer and the fine-tuning of the miRNA gene network are important for neuronal integrity. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in neuronal death, particularly in the adult brain, remain poorly defined. Here, we show that absence of Dicer in the adult forebrain is accompanied by a mixed neurodegenerative phenotype. While neuronal loss is observed in the hippocampus, cellular shrinkage is predominant in the cortex. Interestingly, neuronal degeneration coincides with the hyperphosphorylation of endogenous tau at several epitopes previously associated with neurofibrillary pathology. Transcriptome analysis of enzymes involved in tau phosphorylation identified ERK1 as one of the candidate kinases responsible for this event in vivo. We further demonstrate that miRNAs belonging to the miR-15 family are potent regulators of ERK1 expression in mouse neuronal cells and co-expressed with ERK1/2 in vivo. Last, we show that miR-15a is specifically downregulated in Alzheimer's disease brain. In sum, these results support the hypothesis that changes in the miRNA network may contribute to a neurodegenerative phenotype by affecting tau phosphorylation. Dicer KO vs. control ..

We identified the orphan nuclear hormone receptor ERR-beta as selectively expressed in rod photoreceptors.  Overexpression of ERR-betainduces expression of rod-specific genes in retinas of both wildtype and in Nrl-/- mice, which lack rod photoreceptors. Mutation of ERR-beta results in dysfunction and degeneration of rods, while inverse agonists of ERR-beta trigger rapid rod degeneration, which is rescued by constitutively active mutants of ERR-beta. ERR-betacoordinates expression of multiple genes that are rate-limiting regulators of ATP generation and consumption in photoreceptors.  Furthermore, enhancing ERR-beta activity rescues photoreceptor defects that result from loss of the photoreceptor-specific transcription factor Crx. Our findings demonstrate that ERR-beta is a critical regulator of rod photoreceptor function and survival, and suggest that ERR-beta agonists may be useful in the treatment of certain retinal dystrophies.

Signaling through the adaptor protein MyD88 promotes carcinogenesis in several chemically induced cancer models. Interestingly, we observed a protective role for MyD88 in the development of AOM/DSS colitis-associated cancer. The inability of Myd88-/- mice to heal ulcers generated upon injury creates an inflammatory environment that increases the frequency of mutations and results in a dramatic increase in adenoma formation and cancer progression. Susceptibility to colitis development and enhanced polyp formation were also observed in Il18-/- mice upon AOM/DSS treatment, suggesting that the phenotype of MyD88 knockouts is in part due to their inability to signal through the IL-18 receptor. This study revealed a previously unknown level of complexity surrounding MyD88 activities downstream of different receptors that differentially impact tissue homeostasis and carcinogenesis.

Here, we report that Tbr1, a transcription factor expressed in postmitotic projection neurons, exerts positive and negative control over both regional (areal) and laminar identity. Tbr1 null mice exhibited profound defects of frontal cortex and layer 6 differentiation, as indicated by down-regulation of gene-expression markers such as Bcl6 and Cdh9. Conversely, genes that implement caudal cortex and layer 5 identity, such as Bhlhb5 and Fezf2, were up-regulated in Tbr1 mutants. Tbr1 implements frontal identity in part by direct promoter binding and activation of Auts2, a frontal cortex gene implicated in autism. Tbr1 regulates laminar identity in part by downstream activation or maintenance of Sox5, an important transcription factor controlling neuronal migration and corticofugal axon projections. Similar to Sox5 mutants, Tbr1 mutants exhibit ectopic axon projections to the hypothalamus and cerebral peduncle. Together, our findings show that Tbr1 coordinately regulates regional and laminar identity of postmitotic cortical neurons.

(GUDMAP Series_id: 30)|The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney. The central thesis is straightforward. The use of microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

Fsp27 is expressed in both BAT and WAT and promotes lipid storage and the development of obesity and diabetes. In addition, Fsp27-deficient white adipocytes acquired certain BAT-like properties including reduced lipid droplet size and increased mitochondrial activity. Using microarray and semi-quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we systematically analyzed the gene expression profile in Fsp27-deficient WAT and BAT. Results: We observed that BAT-selective genes were significantly up-regulated, whereas WAT-selective genes were down-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27-/- mice. Expression levels of BAT-selective genes were also dramatically up-regulated in the WAT of leptin and Fsp27 double deficient mice. Furthermore, we observed that expression levels of genes in multiple metabolic pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle and fatty acid synthesis and oxidation were increased in the Fsp27-/- WAT. In contrast, expression levels for extracellular matrix remodeling, the classic complement pathway and TGF-beta signaling"were down-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27-/- mice. Most importantly, regulatory factors that determine BAT identity such as CEBPalpha/beta, PRDM16 and major components in the cAMP pathway were markedly up-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27-/- mice. Interestingly, we observed distinct gene expression profiles in the BAT of Fsp27-/- mice. Conclusion: Our data suggest that Fsp27 acts at upstream to control gene expression of diverse pathways, in particular the expression of regulatory factors that determine the identity of BAT and WAT. Therefore, Fsp27 is an important molecular determinant for the identity of WAT, and loss of Fsp27 leads to the conversion of WAT to a BAT-like tissue. Total RNAs were extracted from individual gonadal WAT of five pairs of 3-month-old wild-type and Fsp27-null male mice. Equal amounts of RNA from five pairs of mice with each genotype were pooled to form RNA pools (total 45 micrograms). Duplicate experiments were carried out. .. 3 month;  male;  Fsp27 knockout;  wild-type;  total RNA;  gonadal WAT of five Fsp27 knockout mice;  gonadal WAT of five wild-type mice;  C57BL/6J;  10090;  Mus musculus;  WAT;

Our aim was to analyse these regulatory functions by deriving a comprehensive tissue-specific combined miRNA and mRNA expression profile of post-natal mouse mammary gland development. We measured the expression of 318 individual murine miRNAs by bead-based flow-cytometric profiling of whole mouse mammary glands throughout a 16-point developmental time course, including juvenile, puberty, mature virgin, gestation, lactation, and involution stages. In parallel whole-genome mRNA expression data were obtained. Results: One third (n = 102) of all murine miRNAs analysed were present during mammary gland development. MicroRNAs were represented in seven temporally co-expressed clusters, which were enriched for both miRNAs belonging to the same family and breast cancer-associated miRNAs. Global miRNA and mRNA expression was significantly reduced during lactation and the early stages of involution after weaning. For most detected miRNA families we did not observe systematic changes in the expression of predicted targets. For miRNA families whose targets did show significant changes, we observed inverse patterns of miRNA and target expression. The datasets are made publicly available and the combined expression profiles represent an important community resource for mammary gland biology research. Conclusions: MicroRNAs were expressed in co-regulated clusters during mammary gland development. Breast cancer-associated miRNAs were significantly enriched in these clusters. The mechanism and functional consequences of this miRNA co-regulation and its correlation with mRNA expression provide new avenues for research into mammary gland biology and generates candidates for functional validation.

RNAi mediated by miRNAs regulates early development in zebrafish, and mouse embryos lacking the miRNA precursor processor, Dicer, are inviable. However, the role of miRNAs during mammalian fertilization is unknown. We here show using microarrays that miRNAs are present in mouse sperm structures that enter the oocyte at fertilization. Sperm contained a broad profile of miRNAs and a subset of potential mRNA targets were expressed in fertilizable, metaphase II (mII) oocytes. Oocytes contained transcripts for the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) catalytic subunit, EIF2C3 (formerly AGO3). However, levels of sperm-borne miRNA (measured by quantitative PCR) were apparently low relative to those of unfertilized, mII oocytes, and fertilization did not alter the part of the mII oocyte miRNA landscape that included the most abundant sperm-borne miRNAs. Coinjection of mII oocytes with sperm heads plus anti-miRNAs - to suppress miRNA function - did not perturb pronuclear activation or preimplantation development. Contrastingly, we provide evidence that nuclear transfer by microinjection alters the miRNA profile of enucleated oocytes. These data argue that sperm-borne prototypical miRNAs play a limited role, if any, in mammalian fertilization or early preimplantation development.

Loss of HR6B results in aberrant histone modification patterns on the trancriptionally silenced X and Y chromosomes (XY body) and on centromeric chromatin in meiotic prophase. We studied the relationship between these chromatin modifications and their effects on global gene expression patterns, in spermatocytes and spermatids.  Results: HR6B is enriched on the XY body and on centromeric regions in pachytene spermatocytes. Global gene expression analyses revealed that spermatid-specific single- and multicopy X-linked genes are prematurely expressed in Hr6b knockout spermatocytes. Very few other differences in gene expression were observed in these cells, except for upregulation of major satellite repeat transcription. In contrast, in Hr6b knockout spermatids, 7298 genes were differentially expressed; 65% of these genes was downregulated, but we observed a global upregulation of gene transcription from the X chromosome. In wildtype spermatids, approximately 20% of the single-copy X-linked genes reach an average expression level that is similar to the average expression from autosomes.  Conclusions: Spermatids maintain an enrichment of repressive chromatin marks on the X chromosome, originating from meiotic prophase, but this does not interfere with transcription of the single-copy X-linked genes that are reactivated or specifically activated in spermatids. HR6B represses major satellite repeat transcription in spermatocytes, and functions in the maintenance of X chromosome silencing in spermatocytes and spermatids. It is discussed that these functions involve modification of chromatin structure, possibly including H2B ubiquitylation. 8 Affymetrix microarrays were generated: 4 from wildtype and HR6B knockout spermatocytes (2 replicates each), and 4 from wildtype and HR6B knockout spermatids (2 replicates each). .. 4-5 weeks;  FVB;  late spermatocyte;  round spermatid;  male;  Hr6b+/+;  Hr6b-/-;  total RNA;  Testis late spermatocyte, HR6B knockout;  Testis late spermatocyte, wildtype;  Testis round spermatid, HR6B knockout;  Testis round spermatid, wildtype;  10090;  Mus musculus;  testis;  Spermatocytes and round spermatids were isolated from 4-5-week-old Hr6b+/+ and Hr6b-/- mouse testes after collagenase and trypsin treatment, followed by sedimentation at unit gravity (StaPut procedure).

They arise in the ventralmost progenitor domain of the rhombencephalon characterized by expression of the homeodomain transcription factors Nkx2.2 and Phox2b. Phox2b in particular plays a key role in the specification of branchiomotor neurons. In its absence, generic neuronal differentiation is defective in the progenitor domain, and no branchiomotor neurons are produced. Conversely, ectopic expression of Phox2b in spinal regions of the neural tube promotes cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation and at the same time induces genes and an axonal phenotype characteristic for branchiomotor neurons. How Phox2b exerts its pleiotropic functions, both as a proneural gene and a neuronal subtype determinant, has remained unknown. To gain further insight into the genetic programme downstream of Phox2b we searched for novel Phox2b-regulated genes by cDNA microarray (here NeuroDev slides) analysis of facial branchiomotor neuron precursors from heterozygous and homozygous Phox2b mutant embryos.

Using an unbiased genetic approach in a mouse model, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) influencing anxiety-like behaviors and beta-carboline-induced seizure vulnerability have been mapped to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 10 and an interval specific congenic strain (ISCS; A.B6chr10; 66 cM to telomere) was developed. This A.B6chr10 strain facilitated defining the behavioral influences of this region as well as gene expression profiling to identify candidate gene(s) underlying this QTL. By microarray studies, an unsuspected E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, Ring Finger 41 (Rnf41 / Neuregulin Receptor Degrading Protein1; Nrdp1) was differentially expressed in the region of interest, comparing the hippocampi of A/J vs A.B6chr10 mice as well as A/J vs B6 mice. By RT-PCR, Rnf41 expression levels were significantly increased 1.5 and 1.3-fold in the hippocampi of C57BL6/J and A.B6chr10 mice compared to A/J mice, respectively. In addition, protein levels of Rnf41 were increased in hippocampi of B6 mice compared to A/J mice across postnatal development with a 5.5-fold difference at P56. Among LxS recombinant inbred mice (N=33), Rnf41 hippocampal mRNA expression levels were significantly correlated with open field behavior (r= .454, p=.0073). Re-analyzing a microarray database of human post-mortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's Area 46/10), RNF41 mRNA expression levels were reduced significantly in patients with major depression and bipolar disorder compared to unaffected controls. Overall, Rnf41 is a pleiotropic candidate gene for anxiety-like behaviors, depression, and vulnerability to seizures. RNF41 and its binding partners provide novel etiological pathways for influencing behavior, highlighting a potential role for the ubiquitin proteasome system in psychiatric illness.

Accordingly there is a need to develop new methods to facilitate the development of much-needed innovative drugs. We have combined reverse- and chemical genetics to identify new targets modulating blood vessel development. Through mRNA expression profiling in mice we identified 155 drugable gene products that were enriched in the microvasculature. Orthologs of 50 of these candidates were knocked down in a reverse genetic screen in zebrafish. 16 of the 50 genes encoded products that affected angiogenesis. In parallel, screening of 300 known drugs and pharmacologically active compounds in a human cell-based angiogenesis assay identified 11 angiogenesis inhibitors. Strikingly the reverse- and chemical genetic screens identified an overlap of three gene products of the same superfamily of serine/threonine protein phosphatases and two compounds targeting that family. Furthermore, the gene products identified in the reverse genetic screen comprise an interacting network with the targets of the chemical genetic screen. Thus, combining reverse- and chemical genetic screens is a powerful approach to identify novel biological processes and drug targets in vertebrates. Keywords: Cell-type comparison 24 samples were analyzed, representing 8 sample groups. In every sample group, three biological replicates were hybridized separately.

These predictions were then tested using high density custom microarrays containing modified oligonucleotides interrogated with purified small RNAs from different tissues. We found that 19% of 4,006 randomly chosen mouse predictions and 40% of 1,859 randomly chosen human predictions gave positive signals with small RNA isolated from whole 10-12 day embryos and a mixture of brain and testis, respectively, 84% of which hybridized to only one strand of the predicted stem-loop structure, whereas only 2% and 12% of equivalent random mouse and human predictions were positive. There was no difference in the validation rates between sequences exhibiting conservation and those that did not. High validation rates were also observed with predictions from fish, fly and worm genomes. Northern blot analysis of the array-positive mouse predictions confirmed that the vast majority of these sequences were detectable as small RNAs whose sizes ranged from 20-110 nucleotides. Taking into account false negative rates of the prediction and detection of known miRNAs, and assuming that this holds for other small RNAs, we estimate that there are 1 million small RNAs expressed in mouse and 3 million small RNAs in human.   Keywords: genomic survey of small RNAs Stem loops were identified in the mouse and human genome using RNALfold with a window size of 110nt. Folding energy and other criteria were used to filter the structures into a set of miRNA-like stems. Stems were chosen randomly and probes designed against the stem regions.

Those reports suggested that inhibition of GSL biosynthesis in animals ameliorated insulin sensitivity accompanied with improved glycemic control leading to decreased liver steatosis in obese mice. In addition, GSL depletion altered hepatic secretory function. In those studies, ubiquitously acting inhibitors for GSL-biosynthesis have been used to inhibit function of the enzyme Ugcg (UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase), catalyzing the first step of the glucosylceramide based GSL-synthesis pathway.  In the present study, a genetic approach for GSL deletion in hepatocytes was chosen to achieve full inhibition of GSL synthesis and to prevent possible adverse effects caused by Ugcg-inhibitors.  Using the Cre/loxP system under control of the albumin promoter, GSL biosynthesis in hepatocytes and their release into the plasma could be effectively blocked.  Deletion of GSL in hepatocytes did not change quantity of bile excretion through the biliary duct. Total bile salt content in bile-, feces- and plasma from mutant mice showed no difference as compared to control animals. Cholesterol concentration in liver-, bile-, feces- and plasma-samples remained unaffected.  Lipoprotein concentration in plasma-samples in mutant animals reached similar levels as in their control littermates. No alteration in glucose tolerance after intraperitoneal application of glucose and insulin appeared in mutant animals. A preventive effect of GSL-deficiency on development of liver steatosis after high fat diet feeding could not be observed.  Conclusion: The data suggest that GSL in hepatocytes are not essential for sterol, glucose and lipoprotein metabolism and do not prevent high fat diet-induced liver steatosis, indicating that Ugcg inhibitors exert their effect on hepatocytes either independently of GSL or mediated by other (liver) cell types.

We describe a novel probe-design technique for DNA microarray analysis that specifically targets the complementary strand of annotated genes, and show that this technique can successfully identify novel NAT expression in normal and tumor samples. Northern and in situ hybridization analyses of selected examples (Acaa1, Aard, and Thbd) confirmed their transcription and dynamic expression in a tissue- and cell-type-specific manner. Our data highlight the importance of NAT expression in the regulation of cellular processes and in oncogenesis. The fundamental basis of the technology described in this paper is applicable to all genes and sample types for the identification of NAT expression that is not possible by conventional cDNA/EST/CAGE information.

To initiate analyses, we compared the model of Eda mutant Tabby mice, in which sweat glands were not formed, to wild-type mice.  We inferred developmental stages and critical genes based on observations at 7 time points spanning embryonic, postnatal and adult life. In wild-type footpads, sweat gland germs were detected at E17.5. The coiling of secretory portions started at postnatal day 1 (P1), and sweat gland formation was essentially complete by P5. Consistent with a controlled morphological progression, expression profiling revealed stage-specific gene expression changes. Similar to the development of hair follicles     the other major skin appendage controlled by EDA     sweat gland induction and initial progression was accompanied by Eda-dependent up-regulation of the Shh pathway. During the further development of sweat gland secretory portions, Foxa1 and Foxi1, not at all expressed in hair follicles, were progressively up-regulated in wild-type but not in Tabby footpads. Upon completion of wild-type development, Shh declined to Tabby levels, but Fox family genes remained at elevated levels in mature sweat glands. The results provide a framework for the further analysis of phased downstream regulation of gene action, possibly by a signaling cascade, in response to Eda.  Keywords: cell type comparison design,development or differentiation design To define target genes of Eda during sweat gland development, we  carried out microarray experiments with mouse footpads that from 7  developmental time points including E15.5, E16.5, E17.5, P1, P3, P5 and  8 weeks of wild-type and Tabby mice.

To learn more about the miRNAs of mammals, we sequenced 60 million small RNAs from mouse brain, ovary, testes, embryonic stem cells, three embryonic stages, and whole newborns. Analysis of these sequences confirmed 387 annotated miRNA genes and identified 110 novel miRNA genes. Over 150 previously annotated miRNAs and hundreds of candidates failed to yield sequenced RNAs with miRNA-like features. Ectopically expressing these previously proposed miRNA hairpins also did not yield small RNAs, whereas ectopically expressing the confirmed and newly identified hairpins usually did yield small RNAs with the classical miRNA features, including dependence on the Drosha endonuclease for processing. These experiments, which suggest that previous estimates of conserved mammalian miRNAs were inflated, provide a substantially revised list of confidently identified mammalian miRNAs from which to infer the general features of mammalian miRNAs. Our analyses also revealed new aspects of miRNA biogenesis and modification, including tissue-specific strand preferences, sequential Dicer cleavage of a metazoan pre-miRNA, newly identified instances of miRNA editing, and evidence for widespread Lin28-like miRNA regulation.

These experiments constitute a portion of the study described below:  Abstract: Type 1diabetes (T1D) can result from a breakdown in peripheral tolerance which is controlled by peripheral tissue antigen (PTA) expression in lymph nodes.  Here, we identified a transcriptional regulator, deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (Deaf1), which regulates the expression of various PTAs in the pancreatic lymph node (PLN). We found, by microarray, that Deaf1 controls the expression of ~600 genes in the PLN.  In the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D, we identified a wild-type form of Deaf1 (DF1) and a truncated alternatively spliced variant (DF1-VAR1) that hetero-dimerizes with and decreases the transcriptional activity of DF1. The expression of DF1 correlates with the expression of various pancreatic PTAs such as insulin, and during the onset of destructive insulitis in NOD mice, DF1 expression is downregulated, while the DF1-VAR1 expression is upregulated in the PLN.  A reduction in DF1-controlled PTA expression in the PLN, leading to decreased peripheral tolerance, could underlie the pathogenesis of NOD disease.  Deaf1-KO mice (4 wk old) and age-matched BALB/c control mice were sacrificed, and the PLN were removed and immediately homogenized in Trizol Reagent.  RNA was extracted in Trizol and then purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Reagents, RNA Nano chips, and the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), according to manufacturer's instructions.  Control and Deaf1-KO mouse RNA was amplified, labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively, and combined with spike A and spike B mix, respectively, using the Agilent low RNA input fluorescence linear amplification kit (Agilent Technologies).  The amplified cRNA was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and specific activity was determined with the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).   Samples were prepared with the gene expression hybridization kit (Agilent Technologies) and two color microarrays were performed using the whole mouse genome (4x44K) Oligo microarray kit, according to manufacturer's instructions.  Microarray chips were washed and scanned using the DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies).

SOD1 is one of the main causative genes of familial ALS which accounts for 10% of cases. These transgenic animals develop a motorneuronal pathology that recapitulates well the neuropathological features occuring in ALS patients, and the progression of the disease can be monitored by a series of motor tests. Gastrocnemius is the first and most affected muscle in the disease, while triceps is relatively spared.

In humans, polymorphic variance at the COMT locus has been associated with modulation of pain sensitivity (Andersen & Skorpen, 2009) and risk for developing psychiatric disorders (Harrison & Tunbridge, 2008). A functional haplotype associated with increased pain sensitivity was shown to result in decreased COMT activity by altering mRNA secondary structure-dependent protein translation (Nackley et al., 2006). However, the exact mechanisms whereby COMT modulates pain sensitivity and behavior remain unclear and can be further studied in animal models. We have pursued a genome-wide approach to examining gene expression in multiple brain regions in inbred strains of mice and have discovered that Comt1 is differentially expressed.  This expression difference was validated with qPCR.  A B2-B4 Short Interspersed Element (SINE) was inserted in the 3'UTR of Comt1 in 14 strains that also shared a common haplotype. Experiments using mammalian expression vectors of full-length cDNA clones with and without the SINE element demonstrate that strains with the SINE haplotype (+SINE) have greater Comt1 enzymatic activity. +SINE mice also exhibit behavioral differences in anxiety assays and decreased pain sensitivity. These results suggest that a haplotype, defined by a 3'UTR B2-B4 SINE element, regulates Comt1 expression and mouse behavior. Brain region samples were isolated from male and female mice of 29 strains (n = 3), 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, BUB/BnJ , C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, C57BR/cdJ, C58/J, CBA/J, CE/J,  DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, I/LnJ, KK/HIJ, MA/MyJ, MRL/MpJ, NOD/LtJ, NON/LtJ, NZO/HILTJ, NZW/LacJ, P/J, PL/J, RIIIS/J, SJL/J, SM/J, SWR/J, and WSB/EiJ. Eight to ten week old male and female mice of each strain were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).  The mice were habituated for one week prior to tissue collection. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation without anesthesia to avoid gene expression differences in response to anesthetic. All dissections were conducted between the hours of 9:00AM to 11:30AM. Prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens were dissected as follows. Immediately following euthanasia, mice were decapitated and the whole brain was removed from the skull.  The brain was then transferred, ventral side up, to an ice-cold brain matrix with 0.5mm spacing (505C Braintree Scientific).  A single razor blade was placed into the first space on the brain matrix and the rostral surface of the brain was placed in the matrix and touching this blade.  Thin, double-edged razor blades were placed in the twelve most anterior spaces.  Following removal from the matrix, the 0.5 mm brain slices were placed flat onto an ice-cold dissection stage and specific regions dissected using anatomical landmarks as described below.  The prefrontal cortex was taken from the slice corresponding to approximately 2.5 mm to 2.0 mm anterior to Bregma.  To do so, a V-shaped wedge was made just medial to the corpus callosum with the apex terminating at about the lateral ventricle (viewed from the caudal side of the slice).  Nucleus accumbens was taken from the adjacent slice approximately 2.0mm to 1.5mm anterior to Bregma.

Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is associated with expression of expanded CTG DNA repeats as RNA (CUGexp RNA). To test whether CUGexp RNA creates a global splicing defect, we compared skeletal muscle of two mouse DM1 models, one expressing a CTGexp transgene, and another homozygous for a defective Mbnl1 gene.  Strong correlation in splicing changes for ~100 new Mbnl1-regulated exons indicates loss of Mbnl1 explains >80% of the splicing pathology due to CUGexp RNA.  In contrast, only about half of mRNA level changes can be attributed to loss of Mbnl1, indicating CUGexp RNA has Mbnl1-independent effects, particularly on mRNAs for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  We propose that CUGexp RNA causes two separate effects: loss of Mbnl1 function, disrupting splicing, and loss of another function that disrupts ECM mRNA regulation, possibly mediated by MBNL2.  These findings reveal unanticipated similarities between DM1 and other muscular dystrophies. MBNL1 knockout and HSALR mice on FVB background.

This period spans from lung specification of foregut cells to the emergence of the primary lung buds. We identified a number of known and novel genes that are temporally regulated as the lung bud forms. Genes that regulate transcription, including DNA binding factors, co-factors, and chromatin remodeling genes, are the main functional groups that change during lung bud formation. Members of key developmental transcription and growth factor families, not previously described to participate in lung organogenesis, are expressed in the mid-foregut during lung bud induction. These studies also show early expression in the mid-foregut of genes that participate in later stages of lung development. This characterization of the mid-foregut transcriptome provides new insights into molecular events leading to lung organogenesis.

Methods: Total RNA was collected by laser capture microdissection from the ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, photoreceptors and the retinal pigmented epithelium of adult mice and was analyzed by oligonucleotide microarrays. The results were validated by quantitative real time PCR and in situ hybridization.    Results: The applied method resulted in good separation of cells of different retinal layers. The spatial distribution of gene expression was determined on a global scale in the retina and the RPE. Our results show good correlation with previously reported retinal gene expression and describe genes not yet characterized in the context of the retina.

These studies allowed us to identify downregulation of expression of the D19Bwg1357e, Zfp162 and Cox15 genes in the M19 strain. We next decided to examine gene expression profile changes in the embryonic gonads of 129 and M19 at additional stages so as to identify other TGCT genes from M19 that are also involved in initiation and maintenance of transformed germ cells.  For this we isolated E13.5, E15.5 and E17.5 genital ridges from male embryos.   Microarray analysis of E13.5, E15.5 and E17.5 genital ridges from male embryos of M19 and 129. Total RNA prepared from the embryonic gonads were analyzed on 12 Affymetrix mouse 430_2 arrays.

We discovered that activation of Fgf receptor- and Wnt-pathways contribute to increased Ffg23 gene transcription in Hyp bone. We found evidence in Hyp bone for increased expression of Fgf1, Fgf7, and Egr2 in the Fgf-signaling pathway and decrements in Sost and Cpz and increments in Sfrp1 and 4 in the Wnt-signaling pathway. Moreover, activation of Fgf and Wnt-signaling stimulated, whereas Tgf    inhibited Fgf23 promoter activity in osteoblasts. We also observed reductions in Bmp1, a metalloproteinase that metabolizes the Fgf23 regulatory extracellular matrix protein Dmp1. These findings suggest that elevation of Fgf23 expression in osteocytes is regulated by interactions between cell surface expression of Phex, extracellular matrix proteins and paracrine effects of Fgf and Wnt. Alterations were also found in enzymes regulating the posttranslational processing and stability of Fgf23, including decrements in the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 and the proprotein convertase Pcsk5. In addition, we found that the Pcsk5 and the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 were decreased in Hyp bone, suggesting that reduced post-translational processing of FGF23 may also contribute to increased Fgf23 levels in Hyp mice. With regards to mineralization, we identified additional candidates to explain the intrinsic mineralization defect in Hyp osteoblasts, including increases in the mineralization inhibitors Mgp and Thbs4, as well as increases in local pH altering factors, carbonic anhydrase 12 (Car12) and 3 (Car3) and the sodium-dependent citrate transporter (Slc13a5). These studies demonstrate the complexity of gene expression alterations in bone that accompanies inactivating Phex mutations and identify novel pathways that may coordinate Fgf23 expression and mineralization of extracellular matrix in Hyp bone. We isolated total RNAs from long bones of both WT and Hyp mice at 12 days of age. Since the RNA yields from the long bones are very low, we combined 2 bone samples with same genotype (WT or Hyp) for one RNA extraction.

This defect is mediated, at least in part, through down regulation of the TCR zeta chain. Investigation of this phenomenon in lupus-prone mice revealed that the hypoproliferative T cell phenotype apparent in BXSB males is mediated in part by the Yaa locus. The BXSB model of lupus is a recombinant inbred strain that was originally derived from a cross between a male SB/LE mouse and a female C57BL/6 mouse. BXSB is unique among lupus-prone mouse strains, in that males carry an autoimmune accelerating factor on the Y chromosome, termed Yaa, which accelerates disease onset in male BXSB mice so that fatal glomerulonephritis occurs around 6 months of age. It was recently reported that the Yaa locus is a translocation of a short stretch of genes including that encoding Toll-like receptor 7 (Tlr-7) from the X to the Y chromosome, leading to a two-fold over expression of a subset of these genes, including Tlr-7, and hypersensitivity of Yaa+ cells to TLR-7 agonists.  To more fully understand the functional significance of the Yaa gene and how it plays a part in the modulation of CD4+ T cell responses, we performed microarray analysis using Affymetrix 430 2.0 arrays on spleens from B6 male B6.Yaa male samples.  The analysis revealed an enhanced signature of innate immunity, including increased expression not only of Tlr7 and Tlr8, in line with reports that the Yaa locus leads to a duplication of the murine Tlr7 and Tlr8 genes , but also of Tlr2, Tlr5, Cd14, Lbp, C2, C3 and genes for several heat-shock proteins. T cells from B6.Yaa mice also displayed decreased TCR   expression. Interestingly, cell surface levels of the inhibitory molecule B7-H1 were increased on B6.Yaa B cells and monocytes/macrophages. In line with increased TLR-7 expression reported in B6.Yaa mice, the TLR-7 agonist imiquimod increased B7-H1 expression on normal B cells. Restoration of proliferation in co-cultures of B6 T cells and B6.Yaa APC with B7-H1 blocking Ab demonstrated a mechanistic contribution of B7-H1 up-regulation to Yaa-mediated APC-dependent T cell hypoproliferation. In addition, T cell hypoproliferation was induced in normal B6 T cells in vitro by the application of imiquimod. However, this defect was not mediated by B7-H1 or secreted factors but was independent of APC and mediated through direct imiquimod stimulation of T cells themselves. We postulate that excessive TLR-7 stimulation in Yaa+ mice mediates T cell hypoproliferation in part through up-regulation of B7-H1 and possibly also through direct T cell-mediated effects.

First, we used laser capture microdissection to perform a genome-wide expression analysis of each of its developing components. The expression patterns of genes identified in this screen were examined in the TMJ and compared to other synovial joints including the shoulder joint and the hip joint. Striking differences were noted, indicating that the TMJ forms via a distinct molecular program. Several components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway are among the genes identified in the screen, including Gli2, which is expressed specifically in the condyle and in the disk of the developing TMJ. We found that mice deficient in Gli2 display aberrant TMJ development such that the condyle loses its growth plate-like cellular organization and no disk is formed. In addition, we utilized a conditional strategy to remove activity of the Hh co-receptor encoded by Smo from chondrocyte progenitors. This cell autonomous loss of Hh signaling allows for disk formation, but the resulting structure fails to separate from the condyle.  Thus, these experiments establish that Hh signaling acts at two distinct steps in disk morphogenesis, condyle initiation and disk-condyle separation, and provide a molecular framework for future studies of the TMJ.

Here we have identified a novel role for the transcription factor AP2gamma in progenitor and neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex. Conditional deletion of AP2gamma causes misspecification of basal progenitors starting at; mid-neurogenesis and gain-of-function experiments show that AP2gamma directly regulates the expression of several genes characteristic for basal progenitors, such as Math3 and Tbr2. The misspecification of basal progenitors upon loss of AP2gamma resulted in their increased death and the ultimate reduction of callosal layer II/III projection neurons. This had pronounced effects on visual performance with a strong reduction of visual acuity. Thus, we have identified a novel regulator of basal progenitor fate regulating the number of layer II/III neurons in an area-specific manner and revealing their importance for accurate function of the visual cortex.

These observations have led us to hypothesize that STAT5a/b are critical for maintenance of normal muscle mass and function.  To investigate this, mice with a skeletal muscle-specific deletion of the Stat5a/b genes (Stat5MKO) were used.  Stat5MKO mice displayed reduced muscle mass, altered fiber-type distribution and reduced activity.  On a molecular level, gene expression in skeletal muscle of Stat5MKO and control mice was analyzed by microarrays and real-time PCR, both in the presence and absence of growth hormone (GH) stimulation.  Several genes involved in muscle growth, fiber-type and metabolism were significantly changed.  Specifically in the quadriceps, a muscle almost exclusively composed of type II fibers, the absence of STAT5a/b led to increased expression of several genes associated with type I fibers and the de novo appearance of type I fibers.  Additionally, it is shown here that expression of the androgen receptor gene (Ar) is controlled by GH through STAT5a/b.  The link between STAT5a/b and Ar gene is likely through direct transcriptional regulation, as chromatin immunoprecipitaion of the Ar promoter region in C2C12 myoblasts was accomplished by antibodies against STAT5a. These experiments demonstrate an important role for STAT5a/b in skeletal muscle physiology and they provide a direct link to androgen signaling.

Alterations of the normal function of these proteins lead to pathological processes such as developmental disorders and neoplastic transformation. We have generated transgenic mice introducing the onco-Dbl cDNA sequences linked to the metallothionein promoter into the germ line of FVB mice and found that onco-Dbl expression affected proliferation, migration and differentiation of lens epithelial cells.  We used high density oligonucleotide microarray to define the transcriptional profile induced by Dbl in the lenses of transgenic mice and observed modulation of genes encoding proteins promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, genes encoding proteins involved in the positive regulation of apoptosis were markedly down regulated while anti-apoptotic genes were strongly up-regulated. Finally, several genes encoding proteins involved in the process of angiogenesis were up-regulated. These observations were validated by histological and immunohistochemical examination of the transgenic lenses, where vascularization can be readily observed. Thus, onco-Dbl expression in mouse lenses induces disruption of the lens architecture, epithelial cell proliferation, EMT, evasion from cell death, and aberrant angiogenesis.  Whole lenses were removed from 2, 14, and 42 day old Dbl transgenic and wild type mice. 4 to 8 individual lenses were pooled .

SPARC-null mice have altered basement membranes and develop posterior sub-capsular cataracts with cell swelling and equatorial vacuoles.  Exchange of fluid, nutrients, and waste products in the avascular lens is driven by a unique circulating ion current.  Here we demonstrate that SPARC-null mouse lenses exhibit abnormal circulation of fluid, ion, and small molecules which leads to altered fluorescein distribution in vivo, loss of resting membrane polarization, and altered distribution of small molecules.  Microarray analysis of SPARC-null lenses showed changes in gene expression of ion channels and receptors, matrix and adhesion genes, cytoskeleton, immune response genes, and cell signaling molecules.  Our results demonstrate that the regulation of SPARC on cell-capsular matrix interactions can influence the circulation of fluid and ions in the lens, and the phenotype in the SPARC-null mouse lens is the result of multiple intersecting pathways.

To identify candidate genes expressed in a variety of ocular tissues during development, we have profiled single cells from the developing eye. Post hoc identification of the origin of these cells showed that they included cells from the periphery of the developing optic cup.  By comparing the expression profiles of these cells to many retinal cell types, candidate genes for preferential expression in the periphery were identified. Single retinal cells were isolated in tubes containing lysis buffer, their mRNAs were reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNAs were PCR amplified for 35 cycles. Labeled cDNA samples were hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarrays and the data was normalized using MAS5.0 software.  Since the retinal cells isolated during these developmental times had not yet adopted their mature morphologies, a post hoc strategy was employed to classify each cell based upon the expression of clusters of genes (Trimarchi et al., 2008).  This classification method allowed for the identification of 21 single cells as developing retinal ganglion (RGC), amacrine (AC) or photoreceptor cells (PR) (Trimarchi et al., 2007) and an additional 42 cells as cycling RPCs (Trimarchi et al., 2008).

Three arrays per genotype. Title: ERRgamma Directs and Maintains the Transition to Oxidative Metabolism in the Post-Natal Heart; Abstract: At birth the heart undergoes a critical metabolic switch to transition from a predominant dependence on carbohydrates during fetal life to a greater dependence on postnatal oxidative metabolism. This remains the principle metabolic state throughout life; although pathologic conditions such as heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy reactivate components of the fetal genetic program to increase carbohydrate utilization. Disruption of the ERR   gene, which is expressed at high levels in the fetal and postnatal mouse heart, blocks this switch resulting in lactatemia, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities and death during the first week of life. Genomic ChIP-on-chip and expression analysis at E18.5 clearly identifies ERR   as both a direct and indirect regulator of a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genetic network that coordinates the postnatal metabolic transition. These findings reveal an unexpected and essential molecular genetic component of the oxidative metabolic gene program in the heart and highlight ERRgamma in the study of cardiac hypertrophy and failure.

We have developed a novel method to project the gene expression profiles of medulloblastomas (MBs)--human cerebellar tumors--onto a mouse cerebellar development sequence: postnatal days 1-60 (P1-P60). Genomically, human medulloblastomas were closest to mouse P1-P10 cerebella, and normal human cerebella were closest to mouse P30-P60 cerebella. Furthermore, metastatic MBs were highly associated with mouse P5 cerebella, suggesting that a clinically distinct subset of tumors is identifiable by molecular similarity to a precise developmental stage. Genewise, down- and up-regulated MB genes segregate to late and early stages of development, respectively. Comparable results for human lung cancer vis-a-vis the developing mouse lung suggest the generalizability of this multiscalar developmental perspective on tumor biology. Our findings indicate both a recapitulation of tissue-specific developmental programs in diverse solid tumors and the utility of tumor characterization on the developmental time axis for identifying novel aspects of clinical and biological behavior.

Hnf4alpha deletion is embryonically lethal with severe defects in visceral endoderm formation, liver maturation and colon development.  However, the precise role of this transcription factor in maintaining homeostasis of the adult intestine remains unclear.  Herein, we aimed to elucidate the adult intestinal functions of Hnf4alpha.  Methods: A conditional intestinal epithelial Hnf4alpha knockout mouse was generated.  Histological abnormality of the colonic mucosa was assessed by immunodetection and Western.  Changes in global gene expression and biological network were analyzed.  Results: Hnf4alpha intestine null mice developed normally until reaching young adulthood. Crypt distortion became apparent in the Hnf4apha null colon at 3 months of age followed by focal areas of crypt dropout, increased immune cell infiltrates, crypt hyperplasia and early signs of polyposis later in life.  A gene profiling analysis identified cell death and cell cycle related to cancer as the most significant sets of genes altered in the Hnf4alpha colon null mice.  Expression levels of the tight junction proteins claudin 4, 8 and 15 were altered early in the colon epithelium of Hnf4alpha mutants and correlated with increased barrier permeability to a molecular tracer that does not normally penetrate normal mucosa.  Conclusion: These observations support a functional role for Hnf4alpha in protecting the colonic mucosa against the initiation of the changes resembling inflammatory bowel diseases and polyp formation. Experiment Overall Design: HNF4alpha was conditionally knockout in the mouse epithelial colon with the villin CRE.

The Dll1 gene was mutated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells such that amino acids 2-116 were replaced with an in-frame fusion of the lacZ gene of E.coli. Mouse Dll1 genomic clones were isolated from a strain 129/SvPas library. The replacement vector was constructed by inserting a 4 kb ClaI/XhoI fragment, which encodes a part of the beta-galactosidase gene followed by the PGK-neo cassette, and a 2.6 kb XhoI/EcoRI fragment as the 3' homologous region of the replacement vector into pKS+. This vector was linearized with SalI and ClaI, and a 4.1 kb SalI/NcoI as the 5' homologous region plus an NcoI/ClaI fragment (800 bp) completing the b-galactosidase gene, were inserted, resulting in the complete replacement vector. This vector was linearized with SalI and electroporated in R1 embryonic stem cells. Correctly targeted clones were identified and verified by Southern blot analysis using external probes from the 3' and 5' region of the targeted area, and were injected into C57BL/6J embryo to obtain germline transmission.

Yet, no phenotype for Eya2 and Eya3 in humans or mouse have been described. In our study we analysed new Eya-deficient mouse model generated by insertional mutagenesis. Expression analysis of Eya3 by in-situ hybridizations and beta-Gal-staining revealed a broad expression of the gene throughout development, e.g. in brain, eyes, branchial arches, somites and limbs. This diverse expression pattern suggests pleiotropic effects of Eya3 in mammalian organisms. In contrast to D. melanogaster, a close examination of the eye by various methods did not show any obvious ocular defects in mutant animals. A broad phenotypical characterization of homozygous mutants displayed decreased body weight and body length. Additionally, behavioral changes as a educed forward locomotor activity and altered exploratory behaviour were identified. A significant reduction of forelimb grip strength and an impairment of cardiac processes in Eya3-/- mice suggest a role for Eya3 in muscle development and heart function. Our results implicate that Eya3 plays various roles outside the eye with effects particularly on heart and muscle function in the mouse.

With these data, we made a comprehensive analysis on gene expression patterns, functional preferences and transcriptional regulations during the liver development.

Mice lacking either of these factors have a largely normal early B cell development. However, when both factors are eliminated simultaneously a block is uncovered at the transition between pre-B and immature B cells, indicating that these proteins exert a critical function in developing B lymphocytes. In mice deficient for Aiolos and OBF-1, the numbers of immature B cells are reduced, small pre-BII cells are increased and a significant impairment in immunoglobulin light chain DNA rearrangement is observed. We identified genes whose expression is deregulated in the pre-B cell compartment of these mice. In particular, we found that components of the pre-BCR, such as the surrogate light chain genes l5l5 and VpreB, fail to be efficiently silenced in double-mutant mice. Strikingly, developmentally regulated nuclear repositioning of the l5l5 gene is impaired in pre-B cells lacking OBF-1 and Aiolos. These studies uncover a novel role for OBF-1 and Aiolos in controlling the transcription and nuclear organization of genes involved in pre-BCR function. OBF-1 or Aiolos or both were deleted and the gene expression profiles for these animals investigated using Affymetrix arrays Experiment Overall Design: Two control wildtype animals, then duplicates for each of the single Aiolos or OBF-1 mutants and further duplicates for the Aiolos/OBF-1 double mutants ..

Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was employed to dissect tissue from the margins of the optic fissure consisting of the outer (presumptive RPE) and inner (presumptive neurosensory retina) layers of the retina. An approximately square-shaped block of optic fissure (50 x 50 mm) was dissected from each side of the fissure.

Mutations in Arx are associated with a variety of human diseases, including X-linked infantile spasm syndrome (OMIM: 308350), X-linked myoclonic epilepsy with mental retardation and spasticity (OMIM: 300432), X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia (OMIM: 300215), X-linked mental retardation 54 (OMIM: 300419), and agenesis of the corpus callosum with abnormal genitalia (OMIM: 300004).  Arx-deficient mice exhibit a complex, pleiotrophic phenotype, including decreased proliferation of neuroepithelial cells of the cortex, dysgenesis of the thalamus and olfactory bulbs, and abnormal nonradial migration of GABAergic interneurons.  It has been suggested that deficits in interneuron specification, migration, or function lead to loss of inhibitory neurotransmission, which then fails to control excitatory activity and leads to epilepsy or spasticities.  Given that Arx mutations are associated with developmental disorders in which epilepsy and spasticity predominate and that Arx-deficient mice exhibit deficits in interneuron migration, understanding the function of Arx in interneuron migration will prove crucial to understanding the pathology underlying interneuronopathies.  Yet, downstream transcriptional targets of Arx, to date, remain unidentified. The aim of this project is to identify bona fide transcriptional targets for the Arx, a transcription factor required for normal migration of interneurons from the ganglionic eminences to the cortex, and to investigate the functions of these genes in the Arx-dependent pathway regulating nonradial neuronal migration. We hypothesize that the genes regulated by the Arx transcription factor will play a critical role in the nonradial migration of interneurons and that the results of this study will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of nonradial neuronal migration, in particular, and possibly the molecular and biochemical pathogenesis underlying epilepsy, mental retardation, infantile spasm syndromes, and other so-called interneuronopathies. We have recently generated a transgenic mouse with a floxed Arx allele (Arxflox).  We have generated conditional knockouts in which Arx is removed specifically from the brain by mating Arxflox mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre behind the neural tube-specific transcriptional regulatory elements of the POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 4 promoter.  Preliminary analyses of these mice suggest that conditional knockout mice recapitulate the nonradial migration defects associated with conventional knockout mice.  We will compare the gene expression profiles of ganglion eminences (GEs; the anatomical source for nonradially migrating interneurons) from male Arxflox mice that express Pou3f-Cre to those from male mice without Arxflox allele.  Animals will be prepared and sacrificed following our institutional protocol.  Tissue will be rapidly dissected from E14.5 (the temporal peak of interneuron migration) GEs (MGE and LGE from both left and right hemispheres).  Preliminary experiments suggest that the amounts of RNA that can be isolated from a pair of GEs is in the range of 2000-3500 ng, which should be sufficient for microarray analysis following linear amplification of RNA.  The GEs from each animal will be combined, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C until RNA is extracted.  Total RNA will be extracted using Trizol followed by RNA purification with the RNeasy cleanup kit.  We will be providing total RNA samples from four wildtype and four transgenic animals (true biological replicates) from three separate litters to mitigate any expression differences resulting from mouse to mouse or litter to litter variation. .. none;  total RNA;  brain, lateral and medial ganglionic eminences;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Using microarray technology, the present study demonstrates that the effects of noise overexposure on the expression of molecules likely to be important to the development of NIHL differ among inbred mice that have distinctive susceptibilities to NIHL including B6.CAST, 129X1/SvJ, and 129S1/SvImJ.  The noise-exposure protocol produced, on average, a permanent loss of about 40 dB in sensitivity for auditory brainstem responses in susceptible B6.CAST mice, but no threshold elevations for the two resistant 129S1/SvImJ and 129X1/SvJ substrains.  Measurements of noise-induced gene expression changes 6 h after the noise exposure revealed significant alterations in the expression levels of 48 genes in the resistant mice, while by these same criteria, there were seven differentially expressed genes in the susceptible B6.CAST mice. Differentially expressed genes in both groups of mice included subsets of transcription factors.  However, only in the resistant mice was there a significant induction of proteins involved in cell-survival pathways such as HSP70, HSP40, p21, GADD45beta, Ier3, and Nf-kappaB.  Moreover, increased expression of three of these factors after noise was confirmed at the protein level. Drastically enhanced HSP70, GADD45beta, and p21 immunostaining were detected 6 h after the noise exposure in subsets of cells of the lateral wall, spiral limbus, and  organ of Corti as well as in  cochlear nerve fibers.  Upregulation of these proteins after noise exposure likely contributes to the prevalence of survival cellular pathways and thus to the resistance to NIHL that is characteristic of the 129X1/SvJ mice. Experiment Overall Design: Female 10-wk-old mice of the B6.CAST and 129X1/SvJ strains were divided randomly into non-noise control and noise-exposure groups.  The non-noise mice served as controls in the gene-profiling experiments to control for the stress induced by experimenter handling and/or confinement of the mice in the noise-exposure chamber that was not directly related to the noise.  This mice were in the noise chamber for a sham exposure.  In contrast, the "noise" groups were exposed to a 105-dB SPL, 10-kHz octave band of noise for 1 h and sacrificed 6 h after the exposure.  Of each of these major groups, eight mice were used for each of  three 129X1/SvJ control and three noise-exposed 129X1/SvJ arrays and two B6.CAST control and two noise-exposed B6.CAST arrays.  Consequently within each subgroup the arrays are biological replicates. .. 10-wk-old control, no exposed to noise, 129X1/SvJ mice microdissected membranous labyrinth from 8 mice;  Membranous labyrinth from 10-wk-old noise-exposed 129X1/SvJ mice sacrificed 6h after a 1h 105 dB octave band of noise exposure centered at 10 kHz;  Microdissected membranous labyrinth from eight 10-wk-old 129X1/SvJ control mice no exposed to noise;  Microdissected membranous labyrinth from eight 10-wk-old 129X1/SvJ mice sacrificed 6h after a 1h 105 dB octave band of noise exposure centered at 10 kHz;  Microdissected membranous labyrinth from eight 10-wk-old B6.CAST mice sacrificed 6h after 1h 105 dB octave band of noise exposure centered at 10 kHz;  Microdissected membranous labyrinth from eight 10-wk-old B6.CAST mice sacrificed 6h after a 1h 105 dB OBN exposure;  Microdissected membranous labyrinth from eight 10-wk-old control, no exposed to noise 129X1/SvJ mice;  Microdissected membranous labyrinth from eight 10-wk-old control, no exposed to noise B6.CAST mice;  total RNA;  cochlea; 129X1/SvJ; control;  cochlea; 129X1/SvJ; noise;  cochlea; 129XI/SvJ; control;  cochlea; 129XI/SvJ; noise;  cochlea; B6.CAST; control;  cochlea; B6.CAST; noise;  10090;  Mus musculus;

The atrioventricular (AV) valves of the heart develop from undifferentiated mesenchymal endocardial cushions, that later remodel into stratified valves with diversified extracellular matrix (ECM). Because the mature valves express genes associated with osteogenesis and exhibit disease-associated calcification, we hypothesized the existence of shared regulatory pathways active in the remodeling AV valves and in bone progenitor cells. In order to define gene regulatory programs of valvulogenesis relative to osteoblast progenitors, we undertook Affymetrix gene expression profiling analysis of murine embryonic day (E)12.5 AV cushions compared to E17.5 remodeled AV valves (mitral and tri-cuspid) and to pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 (subclone4) cells. Overall MC3T3 cells were significantly more similar to E17.5 valves than to E12.5 cushions, supporting the hypothesis that valve remodeling involves the expression of many genes also expressed in osteoblasts. Several transcription factors characteristic of mesenchymal and osteoblast precursor cells, including Twist1 are predominant in E12.5 cushion. Valve remodeling also includes differential regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors as well as characteristic collagen isoform switching. Among the most highly enriched genes during valvulogenesis were members of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family including Asporin, a known negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.  Together, these data support shared gene expression profiles of the remodeling valves and osteoblast bone precursor cells in normal valve development and homeostasis with potential functions in calcific valve disease.

We find robust expression of two Piwi family proteins, MIWI2 and MILI. Their associated piRNA profiles reveal differences from Drosophila wherein large piRNA clusters act as master regulators of silencing. Instead, in mammals, dispersed transposon copies initiate the pathway, producing primary piRNAs, which predominantly join MILI in the cytoplasm. MIWI2, whose nuclear localization and association with piRNAs depend upon MILI, is enriched for secondary piRNAs antisense to the elements that it controls. The Piwi pathway lies upstream of known mediators of DNA methylation, since piRNAs are still produced in Dnmt3L mutants, which fail to methylate transposons.

The masticatory muscles are a specialized group of craniofacial muscles that retain embryonic fiber properties throughout adulthood, suggesting that the developmental origin of these muscles may govern a pattern of expression that differs from limb muscles. To determine the extent of these differences, expression profiling of total RNA isolated from the masseter and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of adult female mice was performed, which identified transcriptional changes in unanticipated functional classes of genes in addition to those associated with fiber type. In particular, the masseters displayed a reduction of transcripts associated with load-sensing and anabolic processes, and heightened expression of genes associated with stress. Consistent with these observations were a significantly smaller fiber cross-sectional area in masseters, significantly elevated load-sensing signaling (phosphorylated Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)), and increased apoptotic index in masseters compared to TA muscles. Based on these results, we hypothesize that masticatory muscles may sense and respond to load differently than limb muscles, where the drive for anabolic processes is reduced, and cell stress mediated processes are enhanced. These results establish a novel classification for the masseter muscle in the spectrum of skeletal muscle allotypes, and may provide insight into the molecular basis for specific muscle-related pathologies associated with masticatory muscles.  Experiment Overall Design: Tissues were isolated from normal adult female mice (C57Bl/6), age 6 months.

We find that transcriptome and proteome levels of function are highly conserved between different mice, while the topological organization (the toponome) of protein clusters in synapses of the hippocampus is highly individual, with only few interindividual overlaps (0.15 %). In striking contrast, the overall spatial patterns of individual synaptic states, defined by protein clusters, have boundaries within a strict and non-individual spatial frame of the total synaptic network. The findings are the first to provide insight in the systems biology of gene expression on transcriptome, proteome and toponome levels of function in the same brain subregion.

To elucidate the cause of mortality we analyzed the potential role of Sp3 in embryonic heart development. Sp3 null hearts display defective looping at E10.5, and at E14.5 the Sp3 null mutants have developed a range of severe cardiac malformations. In an attempt to position Sp3 in the cardiac developmental hierarchy, we analyzed the expression patterns of >15 marker genes in Sp3 null hearts. Expression of Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (Carp) was down regulated prematurely after E12.5, while expression of the other marker genes was not affected. ChIP analysis revealed that Sp3 is bound to the Carp promoter region in vivo. Microarray analysis indicates that small molecule metabolism and cell-cell interactions are the most significantly affected biological processes in E12.5 Sp3 null myocardium. Since the epicardium showed distension from the myocardium, we studied expression of Wt1, a marker for epicardial cells. Wt1 expression was diminished in epicardium-derived cells in the myocardium of Sp3 null hearts.

METHODS: To test our hypothesis and to examine the relevance of oxidative stress in VILI, here we have assessed lung injury and inflammatory responses in Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2(-/-)) mice and wildtype (Nrf2(+/+)) animals following acute (2 h) injurious model of MV with or without administration of antioxidant. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nrf2(-/-) mice displayed greater levels of lung alveolar and vascular permeability and inflammatory responses to MV as compared to Nrf2(+/+) mice. Nrf2-deficieny enhances the levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of VILI. We found diminished levels of critical antioxidant enzymes and redox imbalance by MV in the lungs of Nrf2(-/-) mice; however antioxidant supplementation to Nrf2(-/-) mice remarkably attenuated VILI. When subjected to clinically relevant prolong period of MV, Nrf2(-/-) mice displayed greater levels of VILI than Nrf2(+/+) mice. Expression profiling revealed lack of induction of several VILI genes, stress response and solute carrier proteins and phosphatases in Nrf2(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data demonstrate for the first time a critical role for Nrf2 in VILI, which confers protection against cellular responses induced by MV by modulating oxidative stress. Experiment Overall Design: The Nrf2 wildtype (Nrf2+/+) and Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) CD-1/ICR strains of mice were subjected to mechanical ventilation with high (HVT) amounts of tidal volumes (VT) at 30 ml/kg for 2 hours. The animals subjected to spontaneous ventilation (SpV) for 2 hours were used as controls. Lungs were immediately removed and processed for total RNA isolation using TRIzol reagent (LifeTechnologies, Grand Island, NY). The isolated RNA was applied to Murine Genome 430A GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), which contain probes for detecting ~14,500 well-characterized genes and 4371 expressed sequence tags according to standard microarray protocol. Scanned output files were analyzed by using Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software and were independently normalized to an average intensity of 500. ..

One corollary to this is that disruption of the establishment of epigenetic state in the gametes of a parent, as a result of heterozygosity for mutations in genes involved in reprogramming, could affect the phenotype of offspring that do not inherit the mutant allele. Here we show that such effects do occur following paternal inheritance in the mouse. We detect changes to transcription and chromosome ploidy in adult animals. Paternal effects of this type have not been reported previously in mammals and suggest that the untransmitted genotype of male parents can influence the phenotype of their offspring.

Yes|GSE7309|Done|Baseline|transcription profiling by array|2018-11-15|60|2691|Transcription profiling of mouse preimplantation development|Preimplantation development is a crucial step for successful implantation and pregnancy. Although both compaction and blastocyst formation have been extensively studied, mechanisms regulating early cell division stages before compaction have remained unclear.  Here, we show that ERK MAP kinase function is required for early embryonic cell division and normal cell-cell adhesion before compaction.  Our analysis demonstrates that inhibition of ERK activation in the late 2-cell stage embryos leads to a reversible arrest in G2 phase in the 4-cell stage.  The G2 arrested, 4-cell stage embryos show weakened cell-cell adhesion as compared to control embryos.  Remarkably, microarray analyses show that most of the programmed changes of upregulated and downregulated gene expression during the 4- to 8-cell stages normally proceed in the 4-cell stage-arrested embryos, except for a portion of the genes whose expression profiles closely parallel the stages of embryonic development when arrested in G2 and released to resume development.  These parallel genes include the genes encoding intercellular adhesion molecules, whose expression is found to be positively regulated by the ERK pathway.  We also show that while ERK inactivation in the 8-cell stage embryos does not lead to cell division arrest, it does cause cell division arrest when cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is disrupted.  These results demonstrate an essential role of ERK function in the G2/M transition and the expression of adhesion molecules during the 2-cell to 8-cell stage embryos, and suggest a loose parallelism between the gene expression programs and the developmental stages before compaction. Experiment Overall Design: We examined expression profiles of genes during early cell division stages in mouse preimplantation development.  We performed the genome-wide analysis by using Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays, and examined the effect of the ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 on the expression profiles.  Two independent experiments were carried out.  We collected embryos at six points as follows; control embryos at day 1.5 (cont. 1.5, 2-cell stage), day 2.5 (cont. 2.5, 4- to 8-cell), and day 3.5 (cont. 3.5, morula to blastocyst), and the U0126-treated embryos at day 2.5 (U2.5, 4-cell arrested), embryos released from the U0126-induced arrest at day 3.5 (U3.5, 8-cell) and at day 4.5 (U4.5, morula to blastocyst).

Oocyte-derived bone morphogenetic factor 15 (BMP15) and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) appear to be key regulators of follicular development. The effect of these factors on cumulus cell function before the preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) was assessed by analysis of the transcriptomes of cumulus cells from wildtype (WT), Bmp15-/-, and Bmp15-/- Gdf9+/- double mutant (DM) mice using microarray analysis.  The biological themes associated with the most highly-affected transcripts were identified using bioinformatic approaches, IPA and GenMAPP/MAPPFinder. There were 5,332, 7,640, and 2,651 transcripts identified to be significantly changed in the comparisons of Bmp15-/- vs. WT, DM vs. WT, and DM vs. Bmp15-/- respectively by the criteria of FC (fold change) p <0.01.  Among theses changed transcripts, 744 were commonly changed in all three pair-wise comparisons, and hence were considered to be the most highly affected transcripts by mutation of Bmp15 and Gdf9.  IPA Analyses revealed that metabolism was the major theme associated with the most highly-changed transcripts: glycolysis and sterol biosynthesis were the two most significantly affected pathways.  Most of the transcripts encoding enzymes for sterol biosynthesis were down-regulated in both mutant cumulus cells and in WT cumulus cell after oocytectomy.  Similarly, there was a reduction of de novo-synthesized cholesterol in these cumulus cells.  This suggests that oocytes regulate cumulus cell metabolism, particularly sterol biosynthesis, by promoting the expression of corresponding transcripts.  Furthermore, in WT-mice, Mvk, Pmvk, Fdps, Sqle, Cyp51, Sc4mol, and Ebp, which encode enzymes in the sterol biosynthetic pathway, were found to be expressed robustly in cumulus cells, but expression was barely detectable in oocytes.  Levels of de novo-synthesized cholesterol were significantly higher in cumulus-enclosed oocytes than denuded oocytes.  These results indicate that mouse oocytes are deficient in their ability to synthesize cholesterol and require cumulus cells to provide them with products of the sterol biosynthetic pathway.  Oocyte-derived BMP15 and GDF9 may promote this metabolic pathway in cumulus cells as compensation for their own deficiencies. Experiment Overall Design: Three sets of independent cumulus cell samples were collected for each genotype (wild type, Bmp15-/-, and Bmp15-/-Gdf9+/-) of mice, and were used for the array study as shown below. ..

Pathways associated with the response to infection and the development of Lyme arthritis were identified by global gene expression patterns using oligonucleotide microarrays.  A robust induction of IFN responsive genes was observed in severely arthritic C3H mice at one week of infection, which was absent from mildly arthritic C57BL/6 mice.  In contrast, infected C57BL/6 mice displayed a novel expression profile characterized by genes involved in epidermal differentiation and wound repair, which were decreased in the joints of C3H mice.  These expression patterns were associated with disease state rather than inherent differences between C3H and C57BL/6 mice, as C57BL/6-IL10-/- mice infected with B. burgdorferi develop more severe arthritis that C57BL/6 mice and displayed an early gene expression profile similar to C3H mice.  Gene expression profiles at two and four weeks post infection revealed a common response of all strains that was likely to be important for the host defense to B. burgdorferi and mediated by NF-kB-dependent signaling.  The gene expression profiles identified in this study add to the current understanding of the host response to B. burgdorferi and identify two novel pathways that may be involved in regulating the severity of Lyme arthritis.

In this project, genomic DNA microarrays were used to identify novel genes with abnormal mRNA expression levels in mice with the dominant Hyp mutation of the Phex gene.  Femoral shafts from five-week-old C57BL/6J mice, male and female, normal and Hyp (hemizygous male and heterozygous female), were flushed with saline to remove the marrow.  RNA was extracted from each bone, pooled between two mice for each array, processed to cRNA, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 GeneChip microarrays with probe sets for 45,101 genes.  Twenty microarrays (40 mice) were done with 5 arrays for each treatment group (normal male, Hyp male, normal female and Hyp female).  For each gene, factorial analysis of variance was performed for the main effects of genotype (normal vs. Hyp), sex (male vs. female), and genotype-by-sex interaction.  The mRNA levels for 54 % of the genes on each array were scored as present.  At P < 0.01, 2,635 genes were significant for genotype, 1,488 for sex, and 509 for genotype-by-sex interaction.  There were two probes sets for the Phex gene.  Probe 1450445, at the 3' end of the coding sequence, was low in normal samples (246   37 (10), mean   SEM (n)) and absent in Hyp samples.  Probe 1421979, at the far 3' end of the untranslated region of the cDNA, 3,000 base pairs from the coding sequence, was high in normal mice (3,915   315 (10); 8x brighter than the average gene), undetectable in Hyp males, and 725   93 (5) in Hyp females.  Both probe sets were scored as absent in kidney tissue.  In Hyp bone, male and female, there was significant down-regulation of markers of osteoblasts and bone matrix synthesis with significant up-regulation of markers of blood vessel formation and cytoskeleton.  No prominent skeletal gene was up-regulated in Hyp to attempt to compensate for the low skeletal mineralization.  The genes with significant genotype-by-sex interaction did not show a marked fold difference between male and female Hyp mice.  In conclusion, male and female Hyp mice showed similar depression of mRNA levels of genes related to bone synthesis in the femoral shaft.  There was a high signal level from probes for a sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the Phex gene of normal, but not Hyp, mice, suggesting the need for further study of the molecular organization of this gene.   Experiment Overall Design: Equal amounts of RNA from two mice, matched for genotype and sex were pooled to create each sample for microarray analysis.  Four treatment groups were done:  (1) Normal male mice, (2) Hyp male mice, (3) normal female mice, and (4) Hyp female mice.   Five replicates were done with each replicate containing one sample from each of the four treatment groups for a total of 20 independent samples (40 mice total).

At localized swellings of extracellular matrix known as the endocardial cushions, the endothelial lining of the heart undergoes an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form mesenchymal progenitors of the AV valves. Further growth and differentiation of these mesenchymal precursors results in formation of portions of the atrial and ventricular septae, and generation of thin, pliable valves. The transcription factor Gata4 is expressed in the endothelium and mesenchyme of the AV valves. Using a Tie2-Cre transgene, we selectively inactivated Gata4 within endothelial-derived cells. Mutant endothelium failed to undergo EMT, resulting in hypocellular cushions. Mutant cushions had decreased levels of Erbb3, an EGF-family receptor essential for EMT in the atrioventricular cushions. In Gata4 mutant embryos, Erbb3 downregulation was associated with impaired activation of Erk, which is also required for EMT. Expression of a Gata4 mutant protein defective in interaction with Friend of Gata (FOG) cofactors rescued the EMT defect, but resulted in decreased proliferation of mesenchyme and hypoplastic cushions that failed to septate the ventricular inlet. We demonstrate two novel functions of Gata4 in development of the AV valves. First, Gata4 functions as an upstream regulator of an Erbb3-Erk pathway necessary for EMT, and second, Gata4 acts to promote cushion mesenchyme growth and remodeling. Experiment Overall Design: To further investigate the role of Gata4 in EC development, we specifically inactivated Gata4 in endothelium and endothelium-derived cushion mesenchyme.

Profiling circulating metabolites revealed similar profiles over 72 h in wild type (WT) and POR-null (KO) mice, showing that hepatic P450 and reduced biliary secretion do not affect quercetin metabolism. Transcriptional profiling at 24 h revealed that 2-3 fold more genes responded significantly to quercetin in WT compared to KO in the jejunum, ileum, colon, and liver, suggesting that hepatic P450s mediate many of the biological effects of quercetin, such as immune function, estrogen receptor signaling and lipid, glutathione, purine, and amino acid metabolism, even though quercetin metabolism is not modified. The functional interpretation of expression data in response to quercetin (single dose of 7 mg/animal) revealed a molecular relationship between the liver and jejunum. In WT animals, amino acid and sterol metabolism were predominantly modulated in the liver, fatty acid metabolism response was shared between the liver and jejunum, and glutathione metabolism was modulated in the small intestine. In contrast, KO animals do not regulate amino acid metabolism in the liver or small intestine, they share the control of fatty acid metabolism between the liver and jejunum, and regulation of sterol metabolism is shifted from the liver to the jejunum and that of glutathione metabolism from the jejunum to the liver.  This demonstrates that the quercetin-mediated regulation of these biological functions in extrahepatic tissues is dependent on the functionality of the liver POR. In conclusion, using a systems biology approach to explore the contribution of hepatic phase I detoxification on quercetin metabolism demonstrated the resiliency and adaptive capacity of a biological organism in dealing with a bioactive nutrient when faced with a tissue-specific molecular dysfunction. Experiment Overall Design: All animals were adapted to the RM3 (E) 801710 Soya-free powdered diet (B. S & S. [Scotland] Ltd, UK) over a period of 14 days. Quercetin was added separately to the semi-purified diets at a concentration of 6200 ppm (0.62 %; 6.2 g per kg). 65 male cytochrome P450 reductase null (KO) mice and 65 wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were reared, all aged between 6-8 weeks. Animals were housed 3 per cage, where both temperature and relative humidity were maintained within a range of 19-23oC and 40-70%, respectively. Twelve-hour periods of light were cycled with twelve-hour periods of darkness.   Experiment Overall Design: For each strain of mouse, the following experimental design was used: a control group (25 mice) receiving powdered RM3 diet ad libitum and a group (25 mice) receiving a "high dose" of quercetin (7 mg / mouse). The experimental diet was administered on day 15, following a 14-day adaptation period to the RM3 diet. Animals were sacrificed after 24 h. Experiment Overall Design: RNA samples destined for microarray analysis were only accepted and pooled into three groups if no aberrant signs of degradation (e.g. multiple peaks) were observed. The comprehensive gene expression profiles of the liver, jejunum, ileum, and colon were analyzed.

Transcriptional profiling at 24 h revealed that 2-3 fold more genes responded significantly to quercetin in WT compared to KO in the jejunum, ileum, colon, and liver, suggesting that hepatic P450s mediate many of the biological effects of quercetin, such as immune function, estrogen receptor signaling and lipid, glutathione, purine, and amino acid metabolism, even though quercetin metabolism is not modified. The functional interpretation of expression data in response to quercetin (single dose of 7 mg/animal) revealed a molecular relationship between the liver and jejunum. In WT animals, amino acid and sterol metabolism were predominantly modulated in the liver, fatty acid metabolism response was shared between the liver and jejunum, and glutathione metabolism was modulated in the small intestine. In contrast, KO animals do not regulate amino acid metabolism in the liver or small intestine, they share the control of fatty acid metabolism between the liver and jejunum, and regulation of sterol metabolism is shifted from the liver to the jejunum and that of glutathione metabolism from the jejunum to the liver.  This demonstrates that the quercetin-mediated regulation of these biological functions in extrahepatic tissues is dependent on the functionality of the liver POR. In conclusion, using a systems biology approach to explore the contribution of hepatic phase I detoxification on quercetin metabolism demonstrated the resiliency and adaptive capacity of a biological organism in dealing with a bioactive nutrient when faced with a tissue-specific molecular dysfunction. Experiment Overall Design: All animals were adapted to the RM3 (E) 801710 Soya-free powdered diet (B. S & S. [Scotland] Ltd, UK) over a period of 14 days. Quercetin was added separately to the semi-purified diets at a concentration of 6200 ppm (0.62 %; 6.2 g per kg). 65 male cytochrome P450 reductase null (KO) mice and 65 wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were reared, all aged between 6-8 weeks. Animals were housed 3 per cage, where both temperature and relative humidity were maintained within a range of 19-23oC and 40-70%, respectively. Twelve-hour periods of light were cycled with twelve-hour periods of darkness.   Experiment Overall Design: For each strain of mouse, the following experimental design was used: a control group (25 mice) receiving powdered RM3 diet ad libitum and a group (25 mice) receiving a "high dose" of quercetin (7 mg / mouse). The experimental diet was administered on day 15, following a 14-day adaptation period to the RM3 diet. Animals were sacrificed after 24 h. Experiment Overall Design: RNA samples destined for microarray analysis were only accepted and pooled into three groups if no aberrant signs of degradation (e.g. multiple peaks) were observed. The comprehensive gene expression profiles of the liver, jejunum, ileum, and colon were analyzed. In all cases, except those listed, RNA from 3 mice was pooled to form sample 1, another 3 mice to form sample 2, etc. Thus, 9 mice were used for the four experimental groups: wild-type, wild-type+quercetin, POR-null, POR-null+quercetin. .. between 6-8 weeks,;  RM3 (E) 801710 Soya-free powdered diet + 7mg quercetin from B.S & S.,;  RM3 (E) 801710 Soya-free powdered diet from B.S & S.,;  Male,;  C57BL/6,;  Ileum;  total RNA;  Ileum;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Previous studies using Wnt1Cre and R26R have defined the neural crest and mesodermal origins of vascular smooth muscle in the heart outflow tract and great vessels, although not specifically of the segments that are relevant for the projections of the SCG neurons.  The third pharyngeal arch arteries are lined by neural crest-derived smooth muscle, and consequently, their derivatives, including the entirety of the external carotid arteries and only the base of the internal carotid arteries, also have a neural crest origin.  In contrast, the dorsal aortae are lined by smooth muscle that is mesodermal in origin, and as a result, the internal carotid arteries from just above their origination from the common carotid arteries have a mesoderm-derived smooth muscle layer. To address the possibility that guidance cues for SCG neurons are selectively expressed by the external carotid vs. the internal carotid arteries, we isolated these segments of the vasculature from mouse embryos at E13.5 and extracted RNA to screen microarrays for differentially expressed genes.

In liver, H6PD is required for the 11-oxoreductase activity of 11ss-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11ss-HSD1), which converts inactive 11-oxo glucocorticoids to their active 11-hydroxyl counterparts; consequently, H6PD null mice are relatively insensitive to glucocorticoids, exhibiting fasting hypoglycemia, increased insulin sensitivity despite elevated circulating levels of corticosterone, and increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscles normally enriched in Type II (fast) fibers which have increased glycogen content.

Pooling was used to reduce individual variability, which is high in outbred populations. For the hybridization of the tissue specific RNAs to the GeneChips, samples were prepared according to the recommendations of the Affymetrix user guide. First strand synthesis was carried out by a T7-(dT)24 primer and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies GmbH, Eggenstein, Germany) using 10 mg whole RNA sample. Second strand synthesis was done according to the SuperScript Choice System (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies GmbH) by E. coli DNA-Polymerase I, E. coli Ligase and RNaseH.

Egr3-deficient mice have severe sensory ataxia due to failed development of muscle spindle stretch receptors.  Sensory and motor neurons that normally innervate spindles are absent in Egr3-deficient mice, presumably as a secondary consequence to the loss of trophic signals produced by spindles during development that are required for innervation and neuron survival.  The molecular mechanisms involving motor neuron fate specification, target derived growth factor dependencies, and specification of target innervation have been difficult to study since select markers for functionally specific motor neurons are very poorly characterized.  A more thorough understanding of the molecular mediators of motor neuron biology will be important to evaluate the efficacy of new strategies devised to thwart neuron death that occurs in a variety of human motor neuronopathies and neuropathies. To identify genes specifically expressed by spinal cord fusimotor neurons:  Many motor neuron specific genes have been described over the years.  However, none have been described that distinguish fusimotor neurons from skeletomotor neurons despite the fact that they have distinct muscle targets (muscle spindle stretch receptors) and comprise 25-30% of the spinal motor neuron populations.  Since these motor neurons have remarkably different target innervation and function, we hypothesize that they express genes that establish their specific phenotypes during development. We hypothesize that fusimotor neurons can be distinguished in the spinal cord by characterizing fusimotor neuron specific gene expression.  Once fusimotor neuron specific genes are identified, they will be used as markers to identify fusimotor neurons in complex neuroglial cell populations in vivo and in vitro.  We hypothesize that by characterizing fusimotor neuron specific genes, unique marker molecules will be identified for in vivo and in vitro study of this functionally distinct and important motor neuron subtype.  Moreover, we hypothesize that many of the genes that are specifically expressed by fusimotor neurons will be involved in mechanisms related to their fate specification, target innervation and growth factor dependent biology. We will use the Affymetrix microarray platform to identify genes that are specifically expressed by fusimotor neurons in mouse spinal cord.  The differential expression analysis will be performed on microdissected segments of spinal cord (L3-L5) from wild type and Egr3-deficient mice.  Postnatal Egr3-deficient mice lack muscle spindles and fusimotor neurons in their spinal cords.  By comparing gene expression from microdissected segments of spinal cord (L3-L5) between wild type and Egr3-deficient mice, we hypothesize that fusimotor neuron selective genes can be identified. We will microdissect L3-L5 segments of spinal cord using precise anatomical landmarks to ensure that comparable spinal cord regions are anlayzed from each animal.  For each microarray experiment, total RNA will be extracted from L3-L5 cords (approximately 2 mm length of spinal cord).  The integrity of each RNA sample will be verified by gel electrophoresis.  The intact RNA samples from mice of similar genotype will be pooled from three (3) 27-day old animals.  The intact cord dissection is easier in young animals (eg: 27-day old) and the phenotype is known to exist at this developmental stage.  The RNA from each animal of a similar genotype will be pooled into a single sample to minimize false positive gene calls that may represent genes related to the specific state of vigilance of a particular animal at the time of sacrifice (eg:  activity dependent genes).  Thus, each of the two RNA samples to be analyzed for a particular microarray experiment will represent RNA from three (3) spinal cords of each genotype.  RNA amplification for probe synthesis should not be necessary since we will provide 7 ug of intact pooled total RNA for each sample.  For statistical analysis, the experiment will be performed twice.  Since the RNA samples are precious, they will be provided to the Array Consortium in two shipments with each of the experiments performed independently. .. none;  total RNA;  spinal cord, spinal cord;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Experiment Overall Design: Bmp2 gene ablation was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis in the PR-cre; Bmp2fl/fl (termed Bmp2d/d) uterus. While littermate controls average 0.9 litter of 6.2   0.7 pups per month, Bmp2d/d females are completely infertile. Analysis of the infertility indicates that whereas embryo attachment is normal in the Bmp2d/d as in control mice, the uterine stroma is incapable of undergoing the decidual reaction to support further embryonic development. Recombinant human BMP2 can partially rescue the decidual response, suggesting that the observed phenotypes are not due to a developmental consequence of Bmp2 ablation. Microarray analysis demonstrates that ablation of Bmp2 leads to specific gene changes, including disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway, Progesterone receptor (PR) signaling, and the induction of prostaglandin synthase 2 (Ptgs2). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Bmp2 is a critical regulator of gene expression and function in the murine uterus. .. mixed background;  total RNA;  decidualizing uterus;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Four pools, each comprised of 4 randomly selected individual liver RNAs, were prepared for each sex-genotype combination. The pools were paired randomly to generate 4 separate experimental comparisons: M-WT:F-WT (first array comparison), M-WT:M-KO (second array comparison), F-WT:F-KO (third array comparison), and M-KO:F-KO (fourth array comparison). A total of 4994 HNF4alpha-dependent genes were identified, of which ~1000 fewer genes responded to the loss of HNF4alpha in female liver as compared to male liver. Moreover, 90% of the genes showing sex-specific expression in the liver were shown to lose sex specificity in HNF4alpha-deficient liver.   Experiment Overall Design: An Alexa555-labeled cDNA sample is co-hybridized with an Alexa647-labeled cDNA sample. The samples are then dye-swapped and compared again on a second microarray chip. Together, these two mixed cDNA samples are considered a fluorescent reverse pair (dye swap). Similarly, a second fluorescent reverse pair is generated and the two pairs are averaged. The normalized expression ratio for each array is reported along with the two separate intensities. In this way, dye swaps were carried out for each of the four experimental comparisons.

However, the metabolic impact of excessive fat accumulation within the altered hormonal context of pregnancy is not well understood. We used a murine model of obesity, the high fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mouse to determine adipose tissue-mediated molecular mechanisms driving metabolic dysfunction throughout pregnancy. Remarkably, obese mice exhibited a normalization of visceral fat accumulation at late-stage pregnancy (-53%, P<0.001 E18.5) to achieve levels comparable in mass (per gram of body weight) to that of non pregnant, control diet fed mice. Moreover, whilst obese pregnant mice showed a marked glucose intolerance and apparent insulin resistance at mid-stage pregnancy (E14.5), glucose homeostasis converged with that of lean pregnant mice at late-stage pregnancy, suggesting an unexpected amelioration of the worsening metabolic dysfunction in obese pregnant mice. Transcriptomic analysis of the late-stage visceral fat indicated reduced de novo lipogenic drive (Me1, Fasn, Scd1, Dgat2), retinol metabolism (Rdh11, Rbp4) and inflammation (Mcp1, Tnfalpha) in obese pregnant mice that was confirmed functionally by their lower adipose proinflammatory macrophage density. Elevated expression of estrogen receptor a (ERalpha) in visceral adipose tissue was identified as potential unifying mechanism for the transcriptional changes and reduced adiposity of late stage obese pregnancy. Support for a role for ERalpha was provided by experiments showing that the ERalpha selective agonist PPT suppressed lipogenesis in primary mouse adipocytes and suppressed Me1, Fasn, SCD1 and Dgat2 mRNA levels in mature female human ChubS7 clonal fat cells. Our data reveal a novel role for elevated visceral adipocyte estrogen signaling as a protective mechanism against visceral fat hypertrophy and inflammation in late pregnancy.

This report demonstrates that the combined loss of the histone methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2 in mouse hepatocytes led to the disruption of H3K27me3 homeostasis by age three months, simple fatty liver by age six months and fatal fibrosis by age 15 months. Global and gene-specific reduction of H3K27me3 marks paralleled a concomitant increase of H3K4me3 marks at genes associated with chronic liver disease. Advanced disease was accompanied by widespread infiltration of immune cells, an increase of activated hepatic stellate cells and collagen deposition. Expression of genes from the cytochrome P450 family that control drug metabolism was already deregulated by age two months and mice were fatally hypersensitive to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). These genetic experiments, for the first time, illustrate that the simple loss of EZH1/EZH2, which results in the disruption of epigenetic modifications, is sufficient for the progression of fatal liver disease.

To unravel recurrent ASD-related neuropathological mechanisms, we took advantage of the En2-/- mouse model and performed transcriptome profiling on cerebellar and hippocampal adult tissues.  Methods: En2-/- and WT cerebellar and hippocampal tissue from littermate mice were assessed for differential gene expression using microarray hybridization followed by RankProd analysis. To identify functional categories overrepresented in the differentially expressed genes we used the BIOBASE ExPlain system and mouse phenotype ontology database. Furthermore, we performed direct enrichment analysis of ASD associated genes from the SFARI repository in our differentially expressed genes.  Results: We found 842 differentially expressed genes in En2-/- cerebellum and 862 in the En2-/- hippocampus. Our functional analysis revealed that the molecular signature of En2-/- cerebellum and hippocampus shares convergent pathological pathways with ASD, including abnormal synaptic transmission, altered developmental processes and increased immune response. Furthermore, when directly compared to the repository of the SFARI database, our differentially expressed genes show enrichment of ASD-associated genes significantly higher than previously reported. Among the differentially expressed genes 20 were validated by quantitative PCR.  Conclusions: Our results indicate the En2-/- mouse model of ASD as an appropriate tool to investigate molecular alterations related to ASD.

LIM homeodomain transcription factor Lmx1a is essential for chick mdDA development, and for the efficient differentiation of ES-cells towards a dopaminergic phenotype. In this study, we aimed towards a more detailed understanding of the subtle phenotype in Lmx1a-dr/dr mice. Therefore, microarray analysis was performed, to elucidate the exact molecular programming underlying the neuronal deficits after loss of Lmx1a. Subsequent expression analysis confirmed that Nurr1 is regulated by Lmx1a, and additional downstream targets were identified, like Pou4f1, Pbx1, Pitx2, C130021l20Rik, Calb2 and Rspo2. In line with a specific, rostral-lateral loss of expression of most of these genes during development, Nurr1 and C130021l20Rik were affected in the SNc of the mature mdDA system. Interestingly, this deficit was marked by the complete loss of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling activator Rspo2 in this domain. Expression analysis in Rspo2-/- embryos revealed affected mdDA neurons, partially phenocopying the Lmx1a mutant. Together, in this study we reveal that Lmx1a is essential for a rostral-lateral subset of the mdDA neuronal field, where it might serve a critical function in modulating proliferation and differentiation of mdDA progenitors through the activation of the Wnt activator Rspo2.

The splicing regulatory proteins PTBP1 and PTBP2 show distinct temporal expression profiles in the developing brain. Neuronal progenitor cells predominantly express PTBP1, whereas developing neurons express high levels of PTBP2, which are subsequently reduced late in neuronal maturation. We show here that PTBP2 and the program of splicing it controls are essential to proper neuronal maturation and survival. To investigate its in vivo function, we generated conditional PTBP2 null alleles in mice. Loss of PTBP2 in neuronal progenitor cells leads to neonatal death without gross defects in brain architecture. Mice with specific depletion of PTBP2 in the cortex and forebrain are viable. However over the first three postnatal weeks, when the normal cortex expands and develops mature circuits, the PTBP2 null cortices degenerate. We find that PTBP2-/- neurons cultured from embryonic brain show the same initial viability as wild type cells with proper early marker expression and neurite outgrowth. Strikingly, between 10 and 20 days in culture PTBP2 null neurons undergo a catastrophic failure to mature and die. To assess the target transcripts leading to these phenotypes, we examined the genomewide splicing changes in the PTBP2 null brains. This identified a large number of mis-regulated exons that share a temporal pattern of regulation; in the absence of PTBP2 many isoforms normally found in adults are precociously expressed in the developing brain. Transcripts following this pattern encode essential neuronal proteins affecting neurite growth, pre- and post-synaptic assembly, and synaptic transmission. Our results define a new genetic regulatory program essential for neuronal survival and maturation, where PTBP2 acts to temporarily repress expression of protein isoforms until the final maturation of the neuron. Mice carrying a conditional floxed PTBP2 allele of PTBP2 were crossed to mice carrying Cre recombinase driven by the nestin promoter. The resulting knockout mutant mouse brains were analyzed for changes in gene expression and alternative splicing. Knockout mice were compared to wildtype littermates. Whole mouse brain polyA plus RNA was isolated from three Nestin-cre knockout embryos at embryonic day 18 and compared to three wildtype littermates.

Our knowledge of piRNA biogenesis is sketchy, partly due to an incomplete inventory of the factors involved. Here, we identify Tudor domain-containing 12 (TDRD12; also known as ECAT8) as a novel piRNA biogenesis factor in mice. TDRD12 is detected in complexes containing MILI (PIWIL2), its associated primary piRNAs, and TDRD1, all of which are already implicated in secondary piRNA biogenesis. Male mice carrying either a nonsense point mutation (repro23 mice) or a targeted deletion in the Tdrd12 locus are infertile, and de-repress retrotransposons. We find that TDRD12 is dispensable for primary piRNA biogenesis but essential for production of secondary piRNAs that enter MIWI2 (PIWIL4). Cell culture studies with the insect orthologue of TDRD12 suggest a role for the multi-domain protein in mediating complex formation with other participants during secondary piRNA biogenesis.

Here, we explored artery TLOs (ATLOs) to delineate atherosclerosis T cell responses in apoe-/- mice during aging. Though the T cell repertoire showed systemic age-associated contractions in size and modifications in subtype composition and activation, wt and apoe-/- mice were equally affected. In contrast, ATLOs - but not wt aortae, apoe-/- aorta segments without ATLOs or atherosclerotic plaques - promoted T cell recruitment, altered characteristics of T cell motility, primed and imprinted T cells in situ, generated CD4+/FoxP3-, CD4+/FoxP3+, CD8+/FoxP3- effector and central memory cells, and converted naive CD4+/FoxP3- T cells into induced Treg cells. ATLOs also showed substantially increased antigen presentation capability by conventional dendritic cells (DCs) and monocyte-derived DCs but not by plasmacytoid DCs. Thus, the senescent immune system specifically employs ATLOs to control dichotomic atherosclerosis T cell immune responses. We assembled transcriptome maps of wt and apoe-/- aortae and aorta-draining RLNs and identified ATLOs as major sites of atherosclerosis-specific T cell responses during aging: Transcriptome atlases of wt and apoe-/- abdominal aortae and associated draining RLNs were constructed from laser capture microdissection (LCM)-based whole genome mRNA expression microarrays yielding 6 maps: wt adventitia (tissue-1); wt RLN (tissue-2); apoe-/- ATLOs (tissue-3); apoe-/- RLN (tissue-4); apoe-/- adventitia without adjacent plaques (tissue-5), and plaques (tissue-6). Several two-tissue comparisons within the transcriptome atlases are noteworthy: Unexpectedly, transcriptomes of wt and apoe-/- RLNs were virtually identical; additonal data revealed that transcriptomes of RLNs were strikingly similar to those of inguinal LNs which do not drain the aorta adventitia (as shown of India ink injection experiments of surgically exposed aortae); in sharp contrast, wt adventitia versus ATLOs revealed 1405 differentially expressed transcripts many of which encoded members of GO terms immune response and inflammatory response; the ATLO-plaque comparison also showed > 1000 differentially expressed transcripts; however, wt adventitia versus apoe-/- adventitia without plaque showed few genes (< 5 % of differentially expressed transcripts of the wt adventitia-ATLO comparison). Thus, the aorta transcriptome atlases support the conclusion that neither aorta-draining apoe-/- RLNs nor ILNs participate in atherosclerosis-specific T cell responses. In addition, they demonstrate that T cell responses in the diseased aorta are highly territorialized. Finally, these data show that the immune responses carried out in ATLOs differ significantly from those carried out in plaques. We next identified three major clusters within the transcriptome atlases through ANOVA analyses and application of strict filters: An adventitia cluster, a plaque/ATLO cluster, and a LN/plaque cluster. The total number of differentially expressed genes in each cluster were examined for GO terms immune response, inflammatory response, T cell activation, positive regulation of T cell response, and T cell proliferation. Within the adventitia cluster, similarities of transcriptomes of wt adventitia and apoe-/- adventitia without associated plaque versus ATLOs indicate that a robust number of immune response-regulating genes are selectively expressed in ATLOs which are located within a distance of few   m of the adventitia without associated plaques indicating a very high degree of territoriality of the atherosclerosis T cell response. Furthermore, unlike the total number of differentially regulated transcripts, the majority of transcripts among GO terms immune response and inflammatory response, was up-regulated. Inspection of the plaque/ATLO cluster provided further information: The majority of immune response regulating genes where expressed at a higher level in ATLOs when compared to plaques though plaques also contained a significant number of immune response regulating genes; the reverse is true for genes regulating inflammation. Finally, the lymph node cluster revealed that though the majority of immune response regulating genes resides in both wt and apoe-/- RLNs (with little differences between them) ATLOs express a selected set of immune response regulating genes at a higher level when compared to LNs. In addition, the inflammatory component of ATLOs when compared to LNs is documented by the finding that many more genes regulating inflammation reside in ATLOs even when compared to those of plaques.

Recently, we showed that caspase-1 deficiency strongly reduces high fat diet-induced adiposity although the mechanism is still unclear. We now aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which caspase-1 deficiency reduces modulates resistance to high fat diet-feeding fat accumulation in adipose tissue by focusing on the role of caspase-1 in the regulation of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein metabolism. Methods: Caspase-1 deficient and wild-type mice (both C57Bl/6 background) were used to determine postprandial TG kinetics, intestinal TG absorption, VLDL-TG production as well as TG clearance, all of which strongly contribute to the supply of TG for storage in adipose tissue. Micro-array and qPCR analysis were used to unravel intestinal and hepatic metabolic pathways involved. Results: Caspase-1 deficiency reduced the postprandial response to an oral lipid load, while tissue specific clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins was not changed. Indeed, an oral olive oil gavage containing [3H]TG revealed that caspase-1 deficiency significantly decreased intestinal chylomicron-TG production and reduced the uptake of [3H]TG-derived FA by liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Similarly, caspase-1 deficiency reduced the hepatic VLDL-TG production without reducing VLDL-apoB production, despite an elevated hepatic TG content. Pathway analysis revealed that caspase-1 deficiency reduces intestinal and hepatic expression of genes involved in lipogenesis. Conclusions: Absence of caspase-1 reduces assembly and secretion of TG-rich lipoproteins, thereby reducing the availability of TG-derived FA for uptake by peripheral organs including adipose tissue. We anticipate that caspase-1 represents a novel link between innate immunity and lipid metabolism.

Little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms through which Piwi proteins and piRNAs mediate these processes.  Here, we show that an evolutionarily conserved Tudor and KH-domain containing protein, Tdrkh (a.k.a. Tdrd2), partners with Miwi and Miwi2 in mice via symmetrically dimethylated arginine residues in Miwi and Miwi2.  Tdrkh is localized to pi-bodies and piP-bodies and is required for nuclear localization of Miwi2.  Genetic deletion of Tdrkh arrests meiosis at the zygotene stage, demethylates Line1 DNA, and up-regulates Line1 transposition, but does not promote apoptosis.  Furthermore, Tdrkh mutants have severely reduced levels of mature piRNAs.  Specifically, in Tdrkh mutants, piRNAs accumulate as a distinct population of 5   U-containing 31-37nt RNA that largely complements the missing mature piRNAs.  These results demonstrate that the primary piRNA biogenesis pathway involves 3  5    processing of the 31-37nt intermediates and that Tdrkh is required for this final step of piRNA biogenesis.   However, Tdrkh is not required for the secondary piRNA biogenesis pathway (i.e., the ping pong cycle).  These results shed light on mechanisms underlying primary piRNA biogenesis, an area in which information is conspicuously absent. Tdrkh-floxed mice were generated by the University of Connecticut Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility.  The targeting vector utilized C57Bl6 Tdrkh genome sequences from BAC clone RP23-263K17 (Chori BACPAC) and floxed exons 2-4 (the start codon is in exon 2) and was electroporated into D2 ES cells, a male hybrid C57Bl6/129SEV line.  Clones that survived positive selection with G418 and negative selection with gancyclovir were expanded and screened by PCR with primers recognizing endogenous and exogenous (vector-derived) sequences.  Positive clones were fused to CD-1 embryos, and germline transmission from resulting pups was confirmed by test crosses to CD-1 mice (which also confirmed that all gametes were derived from the targeted clones).  Positive animals were bred to FLP mice to delete the neomycin-targeting cassette, resulting in Tdrkh cKO mice on a C57Bl6/129 background.  cKO mice were bred with EIIa-Cre transgenic mice to excise the floxed exons 2-4 and generate Tdrkh +/- animals.  Heterozygous animas were intercrossed to remove the EIIA transgene. Two independent knockout lines were generated from independent cKO founder lines and showed identical phenotypes in all experiments performed. .. 11dpp;  tdrkh+/-;  tdrkh-/-;  total RNA;  tdrkh+/- testis cells;  tdrkh-/- testis cells;  10090;  Mus musculus;  testis;

Because of APAP's relevance to human poisoning, we set out to determine the relative contributions of the central clock in the SCN and the autonomous clock in the hepatocyte in modulating the chronotoxicity of APAP. Using a conditional null allele of Mop3 (ArntL, Bmal1) we are able to delete the clock from hepatocytes while keeping the central and other peripheral clocks intact (eg, those controlling food intake).  Our data from this hepatocyte-null mouse model suggests that, while the central circadian clock modulates some detoxification pathways indirectly by driving activity patterns and feeding rhythms, the autonomous hepatocyte circadian clock controls major aspects of APAP bioactivation independent of feeding rhythms. 10-20 week old Mop3fxfx mice positive or negative for Cre-recombinase driven by the albumin promoter, housed in 12 hour light:12 dark, ad lib feeding and drinking conditions were sacrificed every four hours over two separate days beginning at ZT0.

Here we analyzed gene expression for a set of GABA receptors in the cochlea of aging CBA mice using the Affymetrix GeneChip MOE430A. Functional phenotypic hearing measures distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes (four age groups) were made. The gene expression  changes from RMA normalized microarray data (40 replicates) were first subjected to one-way ANOVA, and then linear regression was performed. In addition, the log signal ratio was converted to fold change, and selected gene expression changes were confirmed by relative real-time PCR. Major findings: expression of GABA-A receptor subunit 6was upregulated with age and hearing loss, whereas subunit 1 was repressed. In addition, GABA-A receptor associated protein like-1 and GABA-A receptor associated protein like-2 were strongly downregulated with age and hearing impairment.

In brief, probes for which variation over time differed for the genotype class were fitted to the following model: log expression ~ time + time**2 + genotype + genotype*time + genotype*time**2. A univiariate p-value < 0.001 (random variance model) was set for significant probes (genotype*time + genotype*time**2)  and a False Discovery Rate (FDR) was calculated for each probe (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).  Differences in profiles were identified with a Self Organisation Tree Algorithm (MultiplExperiment Viewer (MeV), (Saeed et al, 2006).

Therefore, the living layers of the epidermis are aberrantly exposed to late-stage amniotic fluid, which may serve as the signal to upregulate genes that functionally compensate for the loss of loricrin. Consistent with this hypothesis, metabolomic studies revealed marked changes in amniotic fluid between E14.5 and E16.5 dpc. In addition, we discovered that the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway detects these compositional changes and directly upregulates the expression of genes involved in the compensatory response, thus ensuring postnatal survival. In support of this finding, we demonstrate that genetically blocking the Nrf2 pathway abolishes the compensatory response, and preemptively activating Nrf2 pharmacologically rescues the delay in barrier formation in utero.

Unlike other shelterins, however, RAP1 is not essential for preventing telomere fusions. RAP1 also binds along chromosome arms, where it is proposed to regulate gene expression. To investigate the non-telomeric roles of RAP1 in vivo, we generated a RAP1 whole-body knock-out mouse model. Unexpectedly, these mice presented an early onset of obesity, which was particularly severe in females and was aggravated under a high-fat diet. Rap1-deficient mice showed abnormal accumulation of fat in abdominal depots and developed signs of type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome, including hepatic steatosis and high fasting plasma levels of insulin, glucose, cholesterol, and alanine transaminase. Gene expression analyses of the liver and visceral white fat from Rap1-deficient mice before the onset of obesity indicated deregulation of key metabolic transcriptional programs including fatty acid metabolism, PPARa signalling and glucose metabolism. Transcriptome and Western blotting analyses in liver further identified Ppara and Pgc1a and their target genes as the key metabolic pathways affected by Rap1 deletion. Finally, we show here that RAP1 binds to Ppara and Pgc1a loci and modulates their transcription. These findings underscore an unprecedented role for a telomere-binding protein in the regulation of metabolism. 2 condition experiment: WT versus Rap1 knockout.

To form these circuits, motor neurons (MNs) must extend their axons out of the CNS.  Although motor axon exit from the CNS is an indispensable phase of motor axon pathfinding, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure.  Here, we present the first identification of a genetic pathway that     regulates motor axon exit from the vertebrate spinal cord, utilizing spinal accessory motor neurons (SACMN) as a model system.  SACMN are a homogeneous population of spinal MNs whose axons leave the CNS through a discrete lateral exit point (LEP) and can be visualized by the expression of the cell surface protein, BEN.  We show that the homeodomain transcription factor, Nkx2.9, is selectively required for SACMN axon exit and identify the Robo2 guidance receptor as a likely downstream effector of Nkx2.9; loss of Nkx2.9 leads to a reduction in Robo2 mRNA and protein within SACMN and SACMN axons fail to exit the spinal cord in Robo2-deficient mice.  Consistent with short-range interactions between Robo2 and Slit ligands regulating SACMN axon exit, Robo2-expressing SACMN axons normally navigate through LEP-associated Slits as they emerge from the spinal cord, and fail to exit in Slit-deficient mice.  Our studies support the view that Nkx2.9 controls SACMN axon exit from the mammalian spinal cord by regulating Robo-Slit signaling. We utilized microarray technology to identify novel downstream effectors of the homeodomain transcription factor, Nkx2.9, that regulate spinal accessory motor neuron development. ..

To acquire a comprehensive picture of mitochondrial molecular changes within metabolically active tissues, we focused on hepatic and muscle whole cellular transcriptome and mitochondrial proteome alterations in 16 and 48 weeks old high fat diet (HFD)-feed wild type C57BL/6J and hyperphagic, genetically modified mice with leptin dysfunction (ob/ob and db/db). On transcriptome level, the most discriminative hepatic alterations distinguished between genetically modified and wild type mice, and between overnight fasted and non-fasted mice, while the muscle transcriptional alterations related mainly to the fasting state. The fractions of uniquely different proteins were consistently higher in hyperphagic than in HFD-fed mice and in fasted than non-fasted mice . The liver samples revealed overall higher number of differentially expressed RNAs and proteins than muscle samples. Differentially expressed genes and proteins in the liver, but not in the muscle, could be assigned to several Gene Ontology terms, including oxidation-reduction and several metabolic processes. Thus, altered expression of genes and proteins accompanied the state of obesity and was quantitatively different in the liver and muscle. Our parallel microarray- and quantitative mitochondrial mass spectrometry-based study performed on hepatic and muscle samples identified a higher number of differentially expressed proteins than any other studies investigating obesity-related proteomes.

In the gustatory system, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) have different developmental roles but exert their effects through the same receptors (TrkB and p75). Using genome wide expression analysis, we determined that BDNF and NT4 also regulate the expression of different sets of genes downstream of receptor signaling in geniculate ganglion. These differences in gene expression likely determine their different roles. BDNF and NT4 could function differently because of temporal or spatial differences of expression or the activation of different signaling pathways. BDNF and NT4 regulate cell death, axonal growth and axonal guidance by altering gene expression. Because many of these functions of the two neurotrophins differ in taste development, each likely alters gene expression in a unique way. To determine if removal of BDNF and NT4 alters gene expression in different ways, I will compare microarray gene expression profiles in the geniculate ganglion among BDNF knockout, Nt4 knockout, and wild type mice during development. ..

However, the molecular participants and biological markers that affect and predict adequate embryonic development are largely elusive. We have previously reported that oocyte- directed Connexin 43 (Cx43) depletion leads to embryo implantation defects, although both the morphology of the oocyte and processes presiding embryo implantation appear to undergo normally. In the context of previous data determining Cx43 indispensability to oocyte and embryonic development, we show here that the timing of Cx43 depletion from the oocyte and the ovarian follicle is crucial in determining the severity of subsequent embryonic defects. Specifically, we show that the implantation defects of blastocysts resulting from oocyte- directed Cx43- depleted follicles (depletion occurs at day 3 postnatal), is not due to maternal luteal insufficiency but rather depends solely on the defective blastocysts. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed global defects in the expression of ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors and other genes associated with cellular biosynthetic and metabolic processes in these defective oocytes and specifically blastocysts. We therefore propose that timely expression of Cx43 in the oocyte and ovarian follicles is a major determinant of oocyte developmental competence, by determining the ability of the resulting blastocyst to facilitate biomass expansion and undergo adequate embryo implantation To study the effect of CX43 on the transcriptome of the pre implantation stages, we compared CX43 KO oocytes to the WT oocytes in three different stages of the very early development.

To analyze the role of Sox11 and Sox4 in retinal development, we perturbed their expression pattern by expressing them ectopically in retinal explant culture. Overexpression of Sox11 or Sox4 in retinal progenitors resulted in similar phenotypes, that is, increased cone cells and decreased Muller glia. Sox11-knockout retinas showed delayed onset and progress of differentiation of early-born retinal cells during the embryonic period. After birth, retinal differentiation took place relatively normally, probably because of the redundant activity of Sox4, which starts to differentiate around birth. Neither overexpression nor loss-of-function analysis gave any evidence that Sox11 and Sox4 directly regulate transcription of genes critical to early-born retinal cells. However, histone H3 acetylation status of the early neurogenic genes was lowered in knockout retinas, suggesting that Sox11 regulates the timing of differentiation in early-born retinas by creating an epigenetic state that helps to establish the competency to differentiate. We also found that the unique expression patterns of Sox11 and Sox4 may be achieved by the Notch signaling pathway and by epigenetic regulation. Taking our findings together, we propose that the precise regulation of Sox11 and Sox4 expression during retinogenesis by multiple mechanisms leads to the fine adjustment of retinal differentiation. To delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the retinal action of Sox11, we performed microarray analysis of E18 retinas from wild-type and Sox11 knockout mice. Total RNA was obtained from each one retina of Sox11 knockout and wild-type littermate embryos at E18. ..

Our laboratories have previously developed 2 mouse models that affect cardiac performance. One transgenic mouse model encodes an FHC-associated mutation in alpha-tropomyosin (Tm180) that displays severe cardiac hypertrophy with fibrosis and impaired physiological performance. The other model was a gene knockout of phospholamban (PLB), a regulator of calcium uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiomyocytes; the hearts of these mice exhibit hypercontractility with no pathological abnormalities. Previous work in our laboratories show that the hearts of mice that were genetically crossed between the Tm180 and PLB KO mice rescues the hypertrophic phenotype and improves their cardiac morphology and function. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying cardiac remodeling and rescue of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathic phenotype and identified distinct classes of regulated genes during this process. To understand the changes in gene expression that occur over time in these animal models (Tm180, PLB KO, Tm180/PLB KO and nontransgenic control mice), we conducted microarray analyses of left ventricular tissue at 4 and 12 months of age. .. strain/background = FVB/N;  12 months;  4 months;  ?-tropomyosin transgenic;  ?-tropomyosin transgenic and phospholamban knockout;  nontransgenic;  phospholamban knockout;  total RNA;  NTG mouse heart at 12 months of age;  NTG mouse heart at 4 months of age;  PLB KO mouse heart at 12 months of age;  PLB KO mouse heart at 4 months of age;  Tm180 mouse heart at 12 months of age;  Tm180 mouse heart at 4 months of age;  Tm180/PLB KO mouse heart at 12 months of age;  Tm180/PLB KO mouse heart at 4 months of age;  10090;  Mus musculus;  left ventricle;  Left ventricular tissue was collected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and the samples were stored in -80oC until the RNA isolation.;

In mammary tissue specifically, expression of approximately 570 genes is induced during pregnancy by prolactin through STAT5, which binds to putative regulatory sequences. We have now asked whether mammary-specific induction of these genes can be linked to the presence of additional transcription factors, which would act in concert with STAT5. RNA-seq analysis at parturition identified 370 genes that were under NFIB control. Notably, 75% of these genes, encoding proteins linked to the differentiation of mammary epithelium, were also regulated by STAT5. This study demonstrates that the STAT5-NFIB module is an essential part of genes that define differentiation and function of the mammary gland.

The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected and laser capture microdissection (LCM) plus Microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here represents the gene expression profiles of the embryonic day 14 genital tubercle of the male and the female.

Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein 1 (RKIP1) is a common regulatory node of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) pathways and therefore may be involved in regulation of beta cell homeostasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of RKIP1 in the control of beta cell mass and function. METHODS: Rkip1 (also known as Pebp1) knockout (Rkip1 (-/-)) mice were characterised in terms of pancreatic and glucose homeostasis, including morphological and functional analysis. Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were examined, followed by assessment of glucose-induced insulin secretion in isolated islets and beta cell mass quantification through morphometry. Further characterisation included determination of endocrine and exocrine proliferation, apoptosis, MAPK activation and whole genome gene expression assays. Capacity to reverse a diabetic phenotype was assessed in adult Rkip1 (-/-) mice after streptozotocin treatment. RESULTS: Rkip1 (-/-) mice exhibit a moderately larger pancreas and increased beta cell mass and pancreatic insulin content, which correlate with an overall improvement in whole body glucose tolerance. This phenotype is established in young postnatal stages and involves enhanced cellular proliferation without significant alterations in cell death. Importantly, adult Rkip1 (-/-) mice exhibit rapid reversal of streptozotocin-induced diabetes compared with control mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data implicate RKIP1 in the regulation of pancreatic growth and beta cell expansion, thus revealing RKIP1 as a potential pharmacological target to promote beta cell regeneration.

These SNPs may affect cancer development through altered regulation of MYC expression, but this hypothesis has been difficult to confirm. We generated mice deficient in Myc-335, a putative MYC regulatory element that contains rs6983267, a SNP accounting for more human cancer- related morbidity than any other genetic variant or mutation. In Myc-335 null mice, Myc transcripts were expressed in the intestinal crypts in a pattern similar to that in wild-type mice but at modestly reduced levels. The mutant mice displayed no overt phenotype but were markedly resistant to intestinal tumorigenesis induced by the APCmin mutation.

The epicardium encapsulates the heart and functions as a source of multipotent progenitor cells and paracrine factors essential for cardiac development and repair. Injury of the adult heart results in re-activation of a developmental gene program in the epicardium, but the transcriptional basis of epicardial gene expression has not been delineated. We established a mouse embryonic heart organ culture and gene expression system that facilitated the identification of epicardial enhancers activated during heart development and injury. Epicardial activation of these enhancers depends on a combinatorial transcriptional code centered on CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors. Disruption of C/EBP signaling in the adult epicardium reduced injury-induced neutrophil infiltration and improved cardiac function. These findings reveal a transcriptional basis for epicardial activation and heart injury, providing a platform for enhancing cardiac regeneration.

The broadly similar phenotypes of NCL mouse models, and the potential for interactions between NCL proteins, raise the possibility of shared or converging disease mechanisms. To begin addressing these issues we have developed a novel mouse model lacking both Cln1 and Cln5 genes. These Cln1/5 double knock-out (Cln1/5 dko) mice were fertile, showing a slight decrease in expected Mendelian breeding ratios, as well as impaired embryoid body formation of induced pluripotent stem cells derived from Cln1/5 dko fibroblasts. Typical manifestations of the NCL diseases, seizures and motor dysfunction, were detected at the age of 3 months, earlier than in either single knock-out mouse. Pathological analyses revealed a similar exacerbation and earlier onset of disease in Cln1/5 dko mice, which exhibit a pronounced accumulation of autofluorescent storage material. Cortical demyelination and more pronounced glial activation in cortical and thalamic regions was followed by cortical neuron loss. Alterations in lipid metabolism in Cln1/5 dko showed specifically an increase in serum phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity. Finally, gene expression profiling of Cln1/5 dko cortex revealed defects in myelination and immune response pathways, with a prominent downregulation of alpha-synuclein in Cln1/5 dko mouse brains. The simultaneous loss of both Cln1 and Cln5 genes may enhance the typical pathological phenotypes of these mice by disrupting down shared or convergent pathogenic pathways, which may potentially include interactions of CLN1 and CLN5.

Several lines of evidences suggest that these two monogenic disorders may converge at a molecular level through the dysfunction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. We utilized mouse models of these monogenic disorders to identify genome-wide transcriptional changes in cerebellum and blood and characterize the (dis-)similarity of their molecular signatures. Differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways were distinct for the two mouse models examined, with the exception of immune system related pathways. In the cerebellum of the Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) model, the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway and gene sets associated with synaptic plasticity such as long term potentiation, gap junction, and axon guidance were the most significantly perturbed pathways. The phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway was significantly dysregulated in both blood and brain of Fmr1-KO mice. In both the blood and brain of the Tsc2 heterozygous mouse model, immune system related pathways, genes encoding ribosomal proteins, and glycolipid metabolism pathways were significantly perturbed. Our data suggest that distinct molecular pathways may be involved in autism spectrum disorders with known but different genetic causes, and that blood gene expression profiles of Fmr1-knockout and Tsc2+/- mice mirror some, but not all, of the perturbed molecular pathways in the brain. For the Fmr1-KO model, 10 mice, consisting of 5 KO and 5 WT mice, were profiled. Thus, 10 pairs of blood and cerebella samples were profiled.

To what extent aging-related changes in the intestinal system contribute to the impaired health of the aging body is still under debate. Young (4 months) and old (21 months) male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control low-fat (10E%) or a high-fat diet (45E%) for 2 weeks. During the intervention gross energy intake and energy excretion in the feces were measured. After sacrifice the small and large intestine were isolated whereby the small intestine was divided in three equal parts. Of each of the isolated segments Swiss rolls were prepared for histological analysis and the luminal content was isolated to examine alterations in the microflora with 16S rRNA Q-PCR. Furthermore, mucosal scrapings were isolated from each segment to determine differential gene expression by microarray analysis and global DNA methylation by pyrosequencing. Digestible energy intake was similar between the two age groups on both the control and the high-fat diet implying that macronutrient metabolism is not affected in 21-month-old mice. This observation was supported by the fact that the microarray analysis on RNA from intestinal scrapings showed no marked changes in expression of genes involved in metabolic processes. Decreased expression of Cubilin was observed in the intestine of 21-month-old mice, which might contribute to aging-induced vitamin B12 deficiency. Furthermore, microarray data analysis revealed enhanced expression of a high number of genes involved in immune response and inflammation in the colon, but not in the small intestine of the 21-month-old mice. Aging-induced global hypomethylation was observed in the colon and the distal part of the small intestine, but not in the first two sections of the small intestine.

Fzd1 encodes a WNT receptor whose expression is markedly induced in both mural granulosa cells and cumulus cells during the preovulatory period, in a manner similar to Wnt4.  To study the physiological roles of FZD1 in ovarian physiology and to determine if it serves as receptor for WNT4, Fzd1-null mice were created by gene targeting.  Whereas rare Fzd1-/- females were sterile due to uterine fibrosis and ovarian tubulostromal hyperplasia, the majority were subfertile, producing ~ 1 less pup per litter on average relative to controls.  Unlike WNT4-deficient mice, ovaries from Fzd1-/- mice had normal weights, numbers of follicles, steroid hormone production and WNT4 target gene expression levels.  Microarray analyses of granulosa cells from periovulatory follicles revealed few genes whose expression was altered in Fzd1-/- mice.  However, gene expression analyses of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) revealed a blunted response of both oocyte (Zp3, Dppa3, Nlrp5, Bmp15) and cumulus (Btc, Ptgs2, Sema3a, Ptx3, Il6, Nts, Alcam, Cspg2) genes to the ovulatory signal, whereas the expression of these genes was not altered in WNT4-deficient COCs from Wnt4tm1.1Boer/tm1.1Boer;Tg(CYP19A1-cre)1Jri mice.  Despite altered gene expression, cumulus expansion appeared normal in Fzd1-/- COCs both in vitro and in vivo.  Together, these results indicate that Fzd1 is required for normal female fertility and may act in part to regulate oocyte maturation and cumulus cell function, but is unlikely to function as the sole ovarian WNT4 receptor.

The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2 promote myelination, whereas bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibit myelination. Here we show that these opposing regulators of myelination are functionally linked by the Olig1/2 common target Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1). We demonstrate that Sip1 is an essential modulator of CNS myelination. Sip1 represses differentiation inhibitory signals by antagonizing BMP receptor-activated Smad activity while activating crucial oligodendrocyte-promoting factors. Importantly, a key Sip1-activated target, Smad7, is required for oligodendrocyte differentiation and partially rescues differentiation defects caused by Sip1 loss. Smad7 promotes myelination by blocking the BMP- and   -catenin-negative regulatory pathways. Thus, our findings reveal that Sip1-mediated antagonism of inhibitory signaling is critical for promoting CNS myelination and point to new mediators for myelin repair. We carried out microarray profiling analysis in the Sip1 conditional KO (cKO) mouse spinal cord to detail the change of global gene expression.

We have interrogated the transcriptional architecture of the circadian transcriptional regulatory loop on a genome scale in mouse liver and find a stereotyped, time-dependent pattern of transcription factor binding, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment, RNA expression and chromatin states. We find that the circadian transcriptional cycle of the clock consists of three distinct phases -- a poised state, a coordinated de novo transcriptional activation state, and a repressed state. Interestingly only 22% of mRNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription, suggesting that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms underlie the mammalian circadian clock. We also find that circadian modulation of RNAPII recruitment and chromatin remodeling occurs on a genome-wide scale far greater than that seen previously by gene expression profiling.

However, nothing is known about the function of PPAR-beta in pancreas, a prime organ in the control of glucose metabolism. To gain insight into so far hypothetical functions of this PPAR isotype in insulin production, we specifically ablated Ppar-beta in pancreas.  The mutated mice developed a chronic hyperinsulinemia, due to an increase in both beta-cell mass and insulin secretion. Gene expression profiling indicated a broad repressive function of PPAR-beta impacting the vesicular compartment, actin cytoskeleton, and metabolism of glucose and fatty acids. Analyses of insulin release from the islets revealed an increased second-phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Higher levels of PKD, PKC-delta and diacyglycerol in mutated animals lead to an enhanced formation of trans-Golgi network (TGN)-to-plasma-membrane transport carriers in concert with F-actin disassembly, which resulted in increased insulin secretion and its associated systemic effects. Taken together, these results provide evidence for PPAR-beta playing a repressive role on beta-cell growth and insulin exocytosis, which shed new light on its anti-obesity action. Pancreas-specific knock-out animals were generated by breeding mice harbouring a floxed Ppar-beta (PPARbetafl/fl) to mice expressing the Cre transgene under the control of the Pdx1 promoter (Pdx1Cre).

Here we found that ESET/Setdb1/KMT1E, a histone H3 Lys-9 (H3K9) methyltransferase, was highly expressed at early stages of brain development but down-regulated over time, and that ablation of ESET led to decreased H3K9 trimethylation and misregulation of genes, resulting in severe brain defects and early lethality. In the mutant brain, endogenous retrotransposons were derepressed, and non-neural gene expression was activated. Furthermore, early neurogenesis was most severely impaired, while astrocyte formation was enhanced. We conclude that there is an epigenetic role of ESET in temporal and tissue-specific gene regulation in the developing brain. We used microarrays to identify genes up- or down- regulated when ESET is ablated in the dorsal telencephalon. We used 3 WT and 3 cKO male E14.5 embryo for each analysis ..

The microRNAs have been implicated in cardiac development, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. However, the impact of adult aging on cardiac expression of both miRNA guide strand (miR) and passenger strand (miR*), as well as miRNA clusters have not been well established.    We explored the expression profile of both miR and miR* in the heart. We found that 65 miRNAs were differentially expressed in old versus young adult heart; approximately half of them were clustered miRNAs that were distributed in 11 miRNA clusters. Each miRNA cluster contains from 2 to as many as 71 miRNA genes. The majority of the clusters displayed unified expression, with most cluster members within a cluster being either increased or decreased together, suggesting that most clusters are regulated by a common signaling mechanism and that the combined expression of multiple miRNA genes in a cluster could pose an impact on a broad range of targets during aging. We also found age-related changes in the expression of miR*s. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that miR-21 and miR-21* had their own silencing targets. The expression of both miR and miR* correlated with that of pri-miRNA transcript over the time course from development and maturation through adult aging. Age-related changes in the expression of Ago1 and Ago2 proteins in the heart were also observed.    Our data suggest that a concert of effects, including transcriptional regulation of pri-miRNA transcript and altered expression of Argonaut proteins, contribute to age-related changes in the expression of both miR and miR* strands during adult aging. The major changes occurred later in life, from middle to old age. It is likely that the expression of both miR and miR* is regulated by transcription and Ago1 and Ago2 proteins. Six healthy C57BL/6 mice were used in this study. Three of them were 4 months old (young adult mice: YA), and the other three were 24 months old (old mice). Total RNA samples were isolated from mouse hearts and then shipped to Exiqon Inc., where microRNA array analysis was performed. Three array slides were used for the hybridization.

We identified transcriptome-wide functional and biophysical targets of Mbnl proteins in brain, heart, muscle, and myoblasts using RNA sequencing and crosslinking/immunoprecipitation-sequencing approaches. This analysis identified several hundred splicing events whose regulation depended on Mbnl function, in a pattern indicative of functional interchangeability between Mbnl1 and Mbnl2. A nucleotide resolution RNA map associated repression or activation of exon splicing with Mbnl binding near either 3' splice site or near the downstream 5' splice site, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis of sub-cellular compartments uncovered a global role for Mbnls in regulating localization of mRNAs encoding membrane, synaptic and other proteins in both mouse and Drosophila cells, and Mbnls also contribute to protein secretion. These findings hold several new implications for DM pathogenesis. To assess global functions of Muscleblind proteins, RNA-Seq was performed using WT and Mbnl1 KO brain, heart, and muscle (5 mice each). Additionally, C2C12 mouse myoblasts were depleted of Mbnl1, Mbnl2, or both. Subcellular fractionation experiments were performed to analyze mRNA localization following depletion of Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 in C2C12 mouse myoblasts, and following depletion of Mbnl in Drosophila S-2R+ cells. CLIP-Seq was also performed against Mbnl1 in mouse brain, heart, muscle, and C2C12 myoblasts.

In this investigation, we discovered an interesting phenomenon that mice with either elevated or silenced endocannabinoid signaling show similar defects in multiple pregnancy events, including preimplantation embryo development. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, microarray studies were was conducted using RNAs collected from WT, Cnr1-/- and Faah-/- mouse blastocysts on day 4 of pregnancy. The results show that about 100 genes showed unidirectional changes under either elevated or silenced endocannabinoid signaling. Analysis of functional grouping of these genes revealed that multiple biological functions and pathways are affected under aberrant endocannabinoid signaling, including cell migration. Several genes from the microarray data were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Cell motility assays validated the predicted compromised cell migration in Cnr1-/- and Faah-/- trophoblast stem cells. This study provides molecular basis for biphasic effects of endocannabinoid signaling in female reproduction To generate Cnr1-/-, Faah-/- and WT embryos, mutant and WT females were mated with males of the same genotypes. On day 4 of pregnancy at 1500h, embryos were collected from oviducts and uteri of pregnant females, because Cnr1-/- and Faah-/- females show aberrant oviductal transport of embryos. As expected, WT embryos were mostly at the blastocyst stage and all of them were collected from uteri. However, Cnr1-/- and Faah-/- females had higher percentages of embryos at the morula stage, and some of them were still in the oviduct. Since gene expression profiles greatly vary depending on the embryonic development stage, morulae were not included in gene expression analysis; only RNAs from blastocysts were used to better understand the effects solely arising from disrupted cannabinoid signaling in blastocysts. ..

However, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying mdDA neuron development and maintenance. Here, we determined the spatiotemporal map of genes involved in the development of mdDA neurons to gain further insights into their molecular programming. Genome-wide gene expression profiles of the developing ventral mesencephalon (VM) were compared at different developmental stages leading to the identification of novel regulatory roles of neuronal signaling through nicotinic acthylcholine receptors (Chrna6 and Chrnb3 subunits) and the identification of novel transcription factors (OC1 and 2)) involved in the generation of mdDA neuronal  field. We show here that Pitx3 in cooperation with Nurr1 are the critical components in the activation of the Chrna6 and b3 subunits in mdDA neurons. Furthermore, we provide evidence of two divergent  regulatory pathways resulting in the expression of Chrna6 and Chrnb3 respectively. Embryonic ventral midbrain (VM) tissue was used to generate RNA samples for microarray analysis.

In mouse mutant embryos, we define the hierarchy of signaling events that controls the expression of cardiac-specific transcription factors during commitment of SHF progenitors at E9.25. Wnt and Bmp act downstream of Notch/RBPJ at this developmental stage. Mutation of Axin2, the negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling, enhances Wnt and Bmp signals and suffices to rescue the cardiac differentiation arrest caused by loss of RBPJ.

During heart valve and septa formation, cells from the atrio-ventricular canal (AVC) and outflow tract (OFT) regions of the heart undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and invade the underlying extracellular matrix to give rise to endocardial cushions. Subsequent maturation of newly formed mesenchyme cells leads to thin stress-resistant leaflets. TWIST1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor expressed in newly formed mesenchyme cells of the AVC and OFT that has been shown to play roles in cell survival, cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the role and downstream targets of TWIST1 during heart valve formation remain unclear. To identify genes important for heart valve development downstream of Twist1 we performed global gene expression profiling of AVC, OFT, atria and ventricles of the embryonic day 10.5 mouse heart by tag-sequencing (Tag-seq). Using this resource we identified a novel set of 1246 genes, including 201 regulators of transcription, enriched in the valve forming regions of the heart. We compared these genes to a Tag-seq library from the Twist1 null developing valves revealing significant gene expression changes. These changes were consistent with a role of TWIST1 in controlling differentiation of mesenchymal cells following their transformation from endothelium in the mouse. To study the role of TWIST1 at the DNA level we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and identified novel direct targets of TWIST1 in the developing heart valves. Our findings are consistent with a role for TWIST1 in the differentiation of AVC mesenchyme post-EMT in the mouse, and suggest that TWIST1 exerts its function by direct DNA binding to activate valve specific gene expression. Profiled the AVC, OFT, atria and ventricles of the embryonic day 10.5 mouse heart by tag-sequencing (Tag-seq) (no replicates).

Differentially expressed genes that we common to all three stages examined were considered to be likely candidates for Lmx1b regulation and further evaluated.

Inducible Braf knockout mice enabled us to unravel a new role of neuronal MAPK signaling for emotional behavior. Braf mice that were induced during adulthood showed normal anxiety but increased depression-like behavior, in accordance with pharmacological findings. In contrast, the inactivation of Braf in the juvenile brain leads to normal depression-like behavior but decreased anxiety in adults. In these mutants we found no alteration of GABAergic neurotransmission but reduced neuronal arborization in the dentate gyrus. Analysis of gene expression in the hippocampus revealed nine downregulated MAPK target genes that represent candidates to cause the mutant phenotype.   Our results reveal the differential function of MAPK signaling in juvenile and adult life phases and emphasize the early postnatal period as critical for the determination of anxiety in adults. Moreover, these results validate inducible gene inactivation as new valuable approach, allowing to discriminate between gene function in the adult and the developing postnatal brain.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a key modulator of the transcriptional response to hypoxia and is increased in colon cancer. However, the role of HIF in colon carcinogenesis in vivo remains unclear. Intestinal epithelium-specific disruption of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) resulted in constitutive HIF signaling, and increased HIF expression augmented colon tumorigenesis in the Apcmin/+ intestinal tumor model. Intestine-specific disruption of Vhl increased colon tumor multiplicity and progression from adenomas to carcinomas. These effects were ameliorated in mice with double disruption of Vhl and Hif-2  . Activation of HIF signaling resulted in increased cell survival in normal colon tissue, however tumor apoptosis was not affected. Interestingly, a robust activation of cyclin D1 was observed in tumors of Apcmin/+ mice in which HIF-2alpha was activated in the intestine. Consistent with this result, BrdU incorporation indicated that cellular proliferation was increased in colon tumors following HIF activation. Further analysis demonstrated that dysregulation of the intestinal iron absorption transporter divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1) was a critical event in HIF-2alpha-mediated colon carcinogenesis.

The hypothesis tested was that Tdrd7 is involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression in the lens. Results provide evidence for differential regulation of genes involved in lens homeostasis and cataract formation in the absence of Tdrd7. In eukaryotic cells, cytoplasmic RNA granules (RGs) function in the post-transcriptional control of gene expression.  However, the involvement of RGs and their component proteins in vertebrate organogenesis is unknown.  We report two independent cases of pediatric cataract with loss-of-function mutations in TDRD7, which encodes a Tudor domain RNA binding protein.  TDRD7 deficiency in chick lens produces cataracts, and Tdrd7 null mouse mutants develop cataracts, as well as features of glaucoma and male sterility due to azoospermia.  In lens fiber cells, TDRD7 is necessary for the RG-mediated post-transcriptional control of critical lens mRNAs, while in the testis it functions as a component of a specialized RG, the chromatoid body.  These findings define a new role for RGs in vertebrate organogenesis, and a novel mechanism for cataractogenesis.

How these various structures are established is poorly understood, but we propose that specific histone H2A variants will have a key role in remodelling chromatin during differentiation. Structurally, we show here that the gain of just a single acidic amino acid residue has generated a new mouse 'H2A.Bbd-like' histone variant, H2A.Lap1, and that when incorporated into nucleosomal arrays imparts on them unique biophysical properties that are distinct from arrays containing either H2A or human H2A.Bbd. Functionally, we identify H2A.Lap1 as a novel chromatin component of active genes that are expressed during spermatogenesis, and in combination with H2A.Z create a unique chromatin landscape at the start site of transcription. During round spermatid differentiation, H2A.Lap1 dramatically loads onto the inactive X chromosome enabling a subset of its genes to be transcriptionally activated. We used microarrays together with ChIP-seq data in order to see distribution of Lap1 and expression level of the Lap1 associated genes Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).

Despite being a ubiquitous component of these complexes, physiological roles for this domain remain undefined.  We screened an N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea (ENU) mutagenized library for ARID domain point mutations and generated an Arid1a/Baf250a hypomorphic allele.  The mutant ARID1a (V1068G) protein is stably expressed at wild-type levels, and it is capable of assembling into a SWI/SNF complex with in vitro mononucleosome disruption activity.  However, its capacity to bind DNA is lost.  Consistent with defective DNA binding, mutant protein occupancy at known SWI/SNF target genes is decreased.  Loss of DNA binding is associated with concurrent changes in SWI/SNF target gene expression.  Mutant embryos manifest heart defects, fail to establish proper yolk sac vasculature, and exhibit hemorrhaging.  As a result of these phenotypes, mutant embryos fail to establish proper circulation, culminating in ischemic arrest in utero between days 9.5 and 11.5.  These data support a role for ARID1a-containing, BAF-A complexes in heart and extraembryonic vascular development, and indicate the ARID domain of ARID1a is essential in this regard.  Hence, intrinsic ARID subunit-DNA interactions are required for normal SWI/SNF function in vivo.

Therefore, it is critical to understand at a global level the post-transcriptional events that are driving these transitions. Here, we have used a systems approach by combining polysome mRNA profiling and bioinformatics to identify RNA binding motifs in mRNAs that either enter or exit the polysome pool during mouse oocyte maturation. Association of mRNA with the polysomes correlates with active translation. Forty-eight hours (h) after PMSG injection, mice were stimulated with hCG for 0, 4, or 14 h, and GV-, MI- and MII-stage oocytes were collected.

Small amounts of progerin are also produced during normal aging. Studies with mouse models of HGPS have allowed the recent development of the first therapeutic approaches for this disease. However, none of these earlier works have addressed the aberrant and pathogenic LMNA splicing observed in HGPS patients because of the lack of an appropriate mouse model. We report herein a genetically modified mouse strain that carries the HGPS mutation. These mice accumulate progerin, present histological and transcriptional alterations characteristic of progeroid models, and phenocopy the main clinical manifestations of human HGPS, including shortened life span and bone and cardiovascular aberrations. By using this animal model, we have developed an antisense morpholino-based therapy that prevents the pathogenic Lmna splicing, dramatically reducing the accumulation of progerin and its associated nuclear defects. Treatment of mutant mice with these morpholinos led to a marked amelioration of their progeroid phenotype and substantially extended their life span, supporting the effectiveness of antisense oligonucleotide-based therapies for treating human diseases of accelerated aging. 6 samples, three from LmnaG609G/G609G mice and three from control Lmna+/+ mice .. 3 mo;  female;  C57BL/6;  LmnaG609G/G609G knock-in;  wt;  total RNA;  Liver, LmnaG609G/G609G;  Liver, wild-type;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  Animals were starved for 6 h before sacrifice;

We examined global gene expression in the  sciatic nerve (SCN) of BKS-db/db mice at 8 and 24 weeks of age to  identify genetic pathways altered in peripheral nerves at early and  advanced stages of DN. The sets of differentially expressed genes were  analyzed to identify enriched biological functions and regulated  genetic pathways. Our results suggest that carbohydrate metabolism and  lipid metabolism pathways are dysregulated in the db/db SCN at 8 weeks  of age. Impairment of Schwann cell-extracellular matrix interaction  and axon guidance occurs early in the development of DN, while  neurotrophic support, neurotransmitter transport and axonogenesis are  impaired at the advanced stage of DN. Gene expression changes also  suggest that oxidative stress- and inflammation-mediated nerve damage occurs by 8 weeks. Our analysis identified mechanisms regulated in the early stages of DN. Additionally, interactions between genes from different pathways provide insight into potential relationships among the regulated pathways. RNA extracted from the SCN of four groups of mice: (8 week old db/db (n=8) or db/+ (n=8), and 24 week old db/db (n=6) or db/+ (n=7)) was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays.

However, the functional importance of NAGNAG alternative splicing is highly controversial. Using very deep RNA-Seq data from sixteen human and eight mouse tissues, we found that approximately half of alternatively spliced NAGNAGs undergo tissue-specific regulation and that regulated events have been selectively retained: alternative splicing of strongly tissue-specific NAGNAGs was ten times as likely to be conserved between species as for non-tissue-specific events. Further, alternative splicing of human NAGNAGs was associated with an order of magnitude increase in the frequency of exon length changes at orthologous mouse/rat exon boundaries, suggesting that NAGNAGs accelerate exon evolution. Together, our analyses show that NAGNAG alternative splicing constitutes a major generator of tissue-specific proteome diversity and accelerates evolution of proteins at exon-exon boundaries. mRNA-Seq of sixteen human and eight mouse tissues.

Here we report the lens phenotypes of Notch2 conditionally mutant mice, which exhibited severe microphthalmia, reduced pupillary openings, disrupted fiber cell morphology, eventual loss of the anterior epithelium, fiber cell dysgenesis, and cataracts. Notch2 mutants also had a persistent lens stalk phenotype at E11.5, and aberrant DNA synthesis in the fiber cell compartment by E14.5. Gene expression analyses showed elevated levels of the cell cycle regulators Cdkn1a (p21Cip1), Ccnd2 (CyclinD2) and Trp63 (p63) that negatively regulates Wnt signaling. Although removal of Notch2 phenocopied the increased proportion of fiber cells of Rbpj and Jag1 conditional mutant lenses, Notch2 is not required for AEL proliferation, suggesting that a different receptor regulates this process. Instead, we found that the Notch2 normally blocks progenitor cell death. Overall, we conclude that Notch2-mediated signaling regulates lens morphogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle withdrawal, and secondary fiber cell differentiation. We have compared gene expression of ocular lenses of mice that are lens specific conditional mutants of Notch2 gene to that of littermate controls that had no ablation of Notch2 gene in the lens.

An emerging model of interdependence between neural and vascular systems includes VEGF, with its dual roles as a potent angiogenesis factor and neural regulator.  Although a number of studies have implicated VEGF in CNS development, little is known about the role that the different VEGF isoforms play in early neurogenesis. We used a mouse model of disrupted VEGF isoform expression that eliminates the predominant brain isoform, VEGF164, and expresses only the diffusible form, VEGF120.  We tested the hypothesis that VEGF164 plays a key role in controlling neural precursor populations in developing cortex. We used microarray analysis to compare gene expression differences between wild type and VEGF120 mice at E9.5, the primitive stem cell stage of the neuroepithelium. We quantified changes in PHH3-positive nuclei, neural stem cell markers (Pax6 and nestin) and the Tbr2-positive intermediate progenitors at E11.5 when the neural precursor population is expanding rapidly. Absence of VEGF164 (and VEGF188) leads to reduced proliferation without an apparent effect on the number of Tbr2-positive cells.  There is a corresponding reduction in the number of mitotic spindles that are oriented parallel to the ventricular surface relative to those with a vertical or oblique angle. These results support a role for the VEGF isoforms in supporting the neural precursor population of the early neuroepithelium. Four samples each of E9.5 wildtype or VEGF120 mouse forebrain were analyzed with the Mouse 430 2.0 Affymetrix GeneChip ..

Here, we propose an extension, Gene Array Analyzer (GAA), to our previously published Exon Array Analyzer (EAA). GAA enables to analyse gene arrays on exon level and therefore supports to identify alternative splicing with gene arrays. To show the applicability of GAA, we used gene arrays to profile alternative splice events during the development of the heart. Further re-analysis of published gene arrays could show, that some of these splice events reoccur under pathological conditions.

Whereas all mdDA neurons require Nurr1 for expression of Th and survival, dependence on Pitx3 is only displayed by the mdDA subpopulation that will form the substantia nigra (SNc). Previously, we demonstrated that Pitx3-/- embryos lack the expression of the retinoic acid (RA)-generating enzyme Ahd2, which is normally selectively expressed in the Pitx3-dependent DA neurons of the SNc. Restoring RA-signaling in Pitx3-/- embryos revealed a selective dependence of SNc neurons on the presence of RA for differentiation into Th-positive neurons and maintenance throughout embryonic development. Whereas these data are suggestive of an important developmental role for RA in neurons of the SNc, it remained unclear whether other Nurr1 and Pitx3 target genes depend on RA signaling in a manner similar to Th. In search for genes that were affected in Pitx3-deficient mdDA neurons and restored upon embryonic RA treatment, we provide evidence that Delta-like 1, D2R (Drd2) and TH are regulated by Pitx3 and RA signaling, influencing the mdDA terminal differentiated phenotype. Furthermore, we show that regulation of Ahd2-mediated RA-signaling represents only one aspect of the Pitx3 downstream cascade, since Vmat2, Dat,  Ahd2 (Aldh1a1), En1, En2 and Cck were unaffected by RA treatment and are (subset) specifically modulated by Pitx3. In conclusion, our data reveal several RA-dependent and -independent aspects of the Pitx3-regulated gene cascade suggesting that Pitx3 acts on multiple levels in the molecular subset-specification of mdDA neurons. RNA was isolated from dissected ventral midbrains of E14.5 Pitx3-/- and Pitx3+/+  mouse embryos. 3 Experimental samples each consisting of 3 Pitx3-/- ventral midbrains were hybridized to reference RNA derived from 10 Pitx3+/+ ventral midbrains ..

The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived retinal transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) methods and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis.  Methods: Retinal mRNA profiles of 21-day-old wild-type (WT) and neural retina leucine zipper knockout (Nrl-/-) mice were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT-PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays.  Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 16,014 transcripts in the retinas of WT and Nrl-/- mice with BWA workflow and 34,115 transcripts with TopHat workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed stable expression of 25 known housekeeping genes, and 12 of these were validated with qRT-PCR. RNA-seq data had a linear relationship with qRT-PCR for more than four orders of magnitude and a goodness of fit (R2) of 0.8798. Approximately 10% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and Nrl-/- retina, with a fold change =>1.5 and p value <0.05. Altered expression of 25 genes was confirmed with qRT-PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes uncovered several as yet uncharacterized genes that may contribute to retinal function. Data analysis with BWA and TopHat workflows revealed a significant overlap yet provided complementary insights in transcriptome profiling.  Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of retinal transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.

Repro9/repro9 mutant males are infertile due to meiotic arrest at pachytene stage. Mutants show wide range of abnormalities including inefficient chromosome synapsis, sex body formation and progression through meiotic cycle. Females are unaffected. To determine genes transcriptionally regulated by MYBL1 we analyzed gene expression profiles of wild type and repro9/repro9 mutant testis at 14 and 17 days postpartum. Analysis revealed many misregulated genes, in majority downregulated, at day 14 pp and even more at day 17 pp, probably due to secondary effects of meiotic arrest. Significantly misregulated genes were characterized by Gene Ontology. Comparative gene expression analysis uncovered potential targets of MYBL1 regulation that play roles in regulation of transcription, cell cycle, apoptosis, protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination, chromosome organization and others. Abstract:The transcriptional regulation of mammalian meiosis is poorly characterized, due to few genetic and ex vivo models.  From a genetic screen, we identify the transcription factor MYBL1 as a male-specific master regulator of several critical meiotic processes.  Spermatocytes bearing a novel separation-of-function allele (Mybl1repro9) had subtle defects in autosome synapsis in pachynema, a high incidence of unsynapsed sex chromosomes, incomplete double strand break (DSB) repair on synapsed pachytene chromosomes, and a lack of crossing-over.  MYBL1 protein appears in pachynema, and its mutation caused specific alterations in expression of diverse genes, including some translated postmeiotically.  These data, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) experiments and bioinformatic analysis of promoters, identified direct targets of MYBL1 regulation.  Meiosis in mutant females appears unaffected. These results reveal that MYBL1 is a master regulator of meiotic genes that are involved in multiple processes in spermatocytes, including chromosome synapsis, recombination, and cell cycle progression through pachynema. RNA was extracted from  wt and repro9/repro9 mutant testis from 14 and 17 days old mice. This two time points were selected for sample enrichment in early/midpachytene and latepachytene/diplotene spermatocytes, respectively. Total testis RNA from wild-type (>=3) and mutant (>=3) mice was reverse-transcribed into double stranded cDNA, and biotin-labeled cRNA (GeneChip IVT labeling kit, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was hybridized to Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 GeneChips containing.  The raw data was processed using Affymetrix GCOS software. Two-way ANOVA analysis resolved differentially expressed (DE) genes either between genotypes and/or days using MeV(version 4.6.1) on log2-transformed expression values.

To develop therapies aimed at rescuing the failing heart, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiomyocyte structure and function. OBJECTIVE: microRNAs are important regulators of gene expression, and we sought to define the global contributions made by microRNAs toward maintaining cardiomyocyte integrity. METHODS AND RESULTS: First, we performed deep sequencing analysis to catalog the miRNA population in the adult heart. Second, we genetically deleted, in cardiac myocytes, an essential component of the machinery that is required to generate miRNAs. Deep sequencing of miRNAs from the heart revealed the enrichment of a small number of microRNAs with one, miR-1, accounting for 40% of all microRNAs. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of dgcr8, a gene required for microRNA biogenesis, revealed a fully penetrant phenotype that begins with left ventricular malfunction progressing to a dilated cardiomyopathy and premature lethality. CONCLUSIONS: These observations reveal a critical role for microRNAs in maintaining cardiac function in mature cardiomyocytes and raise the possibility that only a handful of microRNAs may ultimately be responsible for the dramatic cardiac phenotype seen in the absence of dgcr8. We report the miRNA composition of 6-8 week old murine heart. We performed deep sequencing analysis to catalog the miRNA population in the adult heart. 2 sample were sequenced. .. 6-8 weeks;  Female;  Male;  total RNA;  Mouse Heart;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  heart;

Lhx2 is expressed in the hair follicle (HF) buds, while in postnatal telogen HFs Lhx2+ cells reside in the stem cell-enriched epithelial compartments (bulge, secondary hair germ) and co-express selected stem cell markers (Sox9, Tcf4 and Lgr5). Lhx2+ cells represent the vast majority of cells in the bulge and secondary hair germ that proliferate in response to skin injury. This is functionally important, since the wound re-epithelialization is significantly retarded in heterozygous Lhx2 knockout (+/-) mice, while anagen onset in the HFs located closely to the wound is accelerated compared to wild-type mice. Cell proliferation in the bulge and the number of Sox9+ and Tcf4+ cells in the HFs closely adjacent to the wound in Lhx2+/- mice are decreased in comparison to wild-type controls, while expression of Lgr5 and cell proliferation in the secondary hair germ are increased. Furthermore, acceleration of wound-induced anagen development in Lhx2+/- mice is inhibited by administration of Lgr5 siRNA. In addition, Chip-on-chip/ChIP-qPCR and reporter assay analyses reveal Sox9, Tcf4 and Lgr5 as direct Lhx2 targets in keratinocytes. These data strongly suggest that Lhx2 positively regulates Sox9 and Tcf4 in the bulge cells and promotes wound re-epithelization, while it simultaneously negatively regulates Lgr5 in the secondary hair germ and inhibits HF cycling. Thus, Lhx2 operates as a regulator of epithelial stem cell activity during skin response to injury.

Among Gb isoforms, Gb5 is unique in its ability to heterodimerize with members of the R7 subfamily of the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins that contain G protein-g like (GGL) domains.  Previous studies employing Gb5 knockout mice have shown that Gb5 is an essential stabilizer of GGL domain-containing RGS proteins and regulates the deactivation of retinal phototransduction and the proper functioning of retinal bipolar cells.  The purpose of this study is to better understand the functions of Gb5 in the brain outside the visual system by employing molecular biology, immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging technologies.  We show here that mice lacking Gb5 have a markedly abnormal neurologic phenotype that includes neurobehavioral developmental delay, wide-based gait, motor learning and coordination deficiencies, and hyperactivity.  Using immunohistochemical analysis and a green fluorescent reporter of Purkinje cell maturation we show that the phenotype of Gb5-deficient mice includes, in part, delayed development of the cerebellar cortex, an abnormality that likely contributes to the neurobehavioral phenotype.

To understand this tissue specificity, we compared early mutant huntingtin-induced gene expression changes in striatum to those in cerebellum in young Hdh CAG knock-in mice, prior to onset of evident pathological alterations. Endogenous levels of full-length mutant huntingtin caused qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different gene expression changes in the two brain regions. Importantly, the quantitatively different responses in striatum and cerebellum in mutant mice were well accounted for by the intrinsic molecular differences in gene expression between striatum and cerebellum in wild-type animals. Tissue-specific gene expression changes in response to the HD mutation, therefore, appear to reflect the different inherent capacities of these tissues to buffer qualitatively similar effects of mutant huntingtin. These findings highlight a role for intrinsic quantitative tissue differences in contributing to HD pathogenesis, and likely to other neurodegenerative disorders exhibiting tissue-specificity, thereby guiding the search for effective therapeutic interventions.

Alignment is especially complicated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) because of RNA splicing. A number of RNA-Seq algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. RNA-Seq data is discrete in nature; therefore with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics RNA-Seq data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. The exercise to rigorously compare all viable published RNA-Seq algorithms has not previously been performed. RESULTS:  We developed an RNA-Seq simulator that models the main impediments to RNA alignment, including alternative splicing, insertions, deletions, substitutions, sequencing errors, and intron signal. We used this simulator to measure the accuracy and robustness of available algorithms at the base and junction levels. Additionally, we used RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing to validate the ability of the algorithms to detect novel transcript features such as novel exons and alternative splicing in RNA-Seq data from mouse retina. A pipeline based on BLAT was developed to explore the performance of established tools for this problem, and to compare it to the recently developed methods.

Using integrative massive parallel sequencing and bioinformatics approach, we built genome-wide inventory of transcript variants, their promoters and histone modification states during normal development, using mouse cerebellum as model system. The data we integrated consists of 29,589 (4,792 novel) promoters that transcribe 61,525 (12,796 novel) distinct mRNAs, corresponding to 14,508 protein-coding and 9,862 non-coding genes. While 68% of the multi-transcript genes exhibit alternative splicing, 78% use alternative transcriptional events that are regulated during cerebellar development through H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. The data presented highlight the magnitude of alternative promoters and transcriptional termination as major source of transcriptome diversity along with alternative splicing. We also show that alternative promoters differentially activated during normal cerebellar development are aberrantly used in medulloblastoma, emphasizing the importance of studying gene regulation and function at the isoform-level. Study of transcriptome diversity in cerebellar development. We performed mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq experiments. mRNA-seq were performed on total RNA isolated from two P0, P5, P15 and adult cerebellum using 10 microgram of total RNA as the starting material for sequencing library prep. For each stage, mRNA-seq data was obtained from two lanes of a flowcell. For ChIP-seq experiments, solubilized chromatin was prepared by pooling multiple cerebellum tissues (3-18) and then ChIP-enriched DNA (using anti-RNAP II, anti-H3K4me3, anti-H3K27me3, or negative control IgG antibodies) were isolated. 10 microgram of ChIP-enriched DNA was used to prepare the ChIP-seq library for sequencing in a single lane. .. postnatal day 0;  postnatal day 15;  postnatal day 5;  postnatal day 56;  ab1012;  ab5408;  ab6002;  648628;  690122;  742706;  Abcam Inc.;  Sigma Inc.;  IgG;  anti-H3K27me3;  anti-H3K4me3;  anti-RNAP-II;  adult;  genomic DNA;  total RNA;  Adult(P56)_Cerebellum;  PostNatal-Day0_Cerebellum;  PostNatal-Day15_Cerebellum;  PostNatal-Day5_Cerebellum;  CD1;  10090;  Mus musculus;  cerebellum;

MEN 1 carriers commonly develop parathyroid, anterior pituitary, duodenal and pancreatic endocrine tumors. The phenotype of existing mouse models for the MEN 1 syndrome, with a germline heterozygous (hz) Men1 gene inactivation, show close resemblance to the human MEN 1 syndrome. Menin, the protein encoded for by the MEN1/Men1 gene, lacks homology with known proteins, and evidence of its involvement in different cellular processes is steadily growing. Several interaction partners have been identified, involving different interaction sites on the menin protein. Accumulating evidence suggests a role for menin in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, apoptosis, chromatin modification and DNA damage response and repair. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the MEN1 gene precedes tumor formation in the MEN 1 heterozygous pancreas. We set out to determine if there is a change in gene expression early on in the hz islet, as compared with islets in wildtype (wt) littermates, long before the LOH events occur. We performed a global mRNA expression microarray on islets from young, five-week-old, hz Men1 mice and their wt littermates, and we have subsequently corroborated a subset of the findings on the qPCR and protein level.

In fruit flies and mice, piRNA were implicated in maintenance of genomic integrity by transposable elements silencing. Outside of the germline, piRNA have only been found in Drosophila ovarian follicle cells. Previous studies further reported the presence of multiple piRNA-like small RNA (pilRNA) in fly heads and a small number of pilRNA in mouse tissues and human NK cells. Here, by analyzing high-throughput small RNA sequencing data in more than 130 fruit fly, mouse and rhesus macaque samples, we show widespread presence of pilRNA displaying all known characteristics of piRNA in multiple somatic tissues of these three species. In mouse pancreas and macaque epididymis, pilRNA abundance was compatible with piRNA abundance in the germline. Using in situ hybridizations, we further demonstrate pilRNA co-localization with mRNA expression of Piwi-family genes in all macaque tissues.

While functions of Dicer-dependent miRNA pathways in neurons and oligodendrocytes have been extensively investigated, little is known about the role of Dicer in astrocytes. Here we report the effect of Cre-loxP mediated conditional deletion of Dicer selectively from postnatal astroglia on brain development. Dicer-deficient mice exhibited normal motor development and neurological morphology prior to postnatal week 5. Thereafter mutant mice invariably developed a rapidly fulminant neurological decline characterized by ataxia, severe progressive cerebellar degeneration, seizures, uncontrollable movements and premature death by postnatal week 9-10. Integrated transcription profiling, histological and functional analyses of cerebella showed that deletion of Dicer in cerebellar astrocytes altered the transcriptome of astrocytes to be more similar to an immature or reactive-like state prior to the onset of neurological symptoms or morphological changes. As a result, critical and mature astrocytic functions including glutamate uptake and antioxidant pathways were substantially impaired, leading to massive apoptosis of cerebellar granule cells and degeneration of Purkinje cells. Collectively, our study demonstrates the critical involvement of Dicer in normal astrocyte maturation and maintenance. Our findings also reveal non-cell autonomous roles of astrocytic Dicer-dependent pathways in regulating proper neuronal functions and implicate that loss of or dysregulation of astrocytic Dicer-dependent pathways may be involved in neurodegeneration and other neurological disorders.

Interestingly, the HD CAG repeat, whose length determines age at onset, undergoes tissue-specific somatic instability, predominant in the striatum, suggesting that tissue-specific CAG length changes could modify the disease process. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the tissue specificity of somatic instability may provide novel routes to therapies. However progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of sensitive high-throughput instability quantification methods and global approaches to identify the underlying factors.  Here we describe a novel approach to gain insight into the factors responsible for the tissue specificity of somatic instability. Using accurate genetic knock-in mouse models of HD, we developed a reliable, high-throughput method to quantify tissue HD CAG instability and integrated this with genome-wide bioinformatic approaches. Using tissue instability quantified in 16 tissues as a phenotype and tissue microarray gene expression as a predictor, we built a mathematical model and identified a gene expression signature that accurately predicted tissue instability. Using the predictive ability of this signature we found that somatic instability was not a consequence of pathogenesis. In support of this, genetic crosses with models of accelerated neuropathology failed to induce somatic instability. In addition, we searched for genes and pathways that correlated with tissue instability. We found that expression levels of DNA repair genes did not explain the tissue specificity of somatic instability. Instead, our data implicate other pathways, particularly cell cycle, metabolism and neurotransmitter pathways, acting in combination to generate tissue-specific patterns of instability.  Our study clearly demonstrates that multiple tissue factors reflect the level of somatic instability in different tissues. In addition, our quantitative, genome-wide approach is readily applicable to high-throughput assays and opens the door to widespread applications with the potential to accelerate the discovery of drugs that alter tissue instability.

Recent studies have demonstrated strong genetic associations between AMD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes such as CFH and HTRA1. However, we have identified monozygotic twins discordant for AMD phenotypes (one with disease, the other without disease), suggesting that an epigenetic mechanism may also contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD.  Methods We identified two twin pairs with phenotypic discordance of AMD. We obtained genomic DNA from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subjected them to DNA methylation-chip analysis (MeDIP-chip) that profiled genome-wide DNA methylation patterns on promoters of all genes and microRNAs. We next utilized the Methyl-Profiler DNA methylation assays to detect the methylation status of selected promoters. Flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of the selected gene in peripheral blood cells, as well as in retinal and choroidal tissues of AMD patients and non-AMD controls.  Results Our MeDIP-chip analysis identified 256 genes with hypo-methylated promoters only in the twins with AMD and 744 genes with hyper-methylated promoters only in the twins with AMD. Importantly, the promoter region of IL17RC was associated with hypo-methylated CpG sites only in the twins with AMD but not in the twins without AMD. We also found the association of the hypo-methylated IL17RC promoter with AMD in 7 pairs of siblings with discordant AMD pathology (P=0.003), as well as an independent patient cohort (95 neovascular wet and 107 geographic atrophy dry AMD patients as well as 96 non-AMD controls (95% CI, 0.01-0.10, P=9.8x10-8 for wet AMD vs. control; 95% CI, 0.05-0.32, P=2.2x10-5 for dry AMD vs. control)). Interestingly, we did not find an association between the levels of methylation on the IL17RC promoter with the previously identified genetic risk alleles in CFH, HTRA1, and ARMS2. We demonstrated an elevated expression of the IL-17RC protein in CD14+ monocytes in the peripheral blood of AMD patients as compared to non-AMD controls. These IL-17RC+ monocytes have elevated expression of CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4. In addition, IL17RC was expressed only in the retinal and choroidal tissues from AMD patients but not from age-matched controls.  Conclusions We show an association of the hypo-methylated IL17RC promoter with AMD, which resulted in the elevated expression of IL-17RC in peripheral blood cells as well as the retinal and choroidal tissues of AMD patients. Our study suggests that the hypo-methylated IL17RC promoter and elevated expression of IL-17RC can potentially serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis of AMD, while IL-17RC can be a new therapeutic target for AMD.

Instead, it stimulates myeloid differentiation that progresses into a myeloproliferative-like disease. Since CREBBP is a transcriptional co-activator, we used gene expression analysis to globally assess functional deficiencies in Crebbp+/- bone marrow stroma cells at a molecular level. Ep300 encodes a protein which is highly similar in structure and function to CREBBP; nevertheless, Ep300+/- mice suffer neither excessive myeloid differentiation nor loss of HSCs. Therefore, to identify expression changes specifically related to Crebbp heterozygosity, we focused on genes that showed significant differences in expression levels between Crebbp+/- and wild-type bone marrow stroma but no difference between Ep300+/- and wild-type. Bone marrow stroma was established from wild-type, Crebbp+/- and Ep300+/- mice that were 3-4 months old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

However, the role of MMP-2 in dystrophin-deficient muscle is not well known. The aim of this study was to verify the role of MMP-2 in dystrophin-deficient muscle by using mdx mice with genetic ablation of MMP-2 (mdx/MMP-2-/-). Gene expression profiles were analyzed in the skeletal muscle of mdx and mdx/MMP-2-/- mice at 1 and 3 months of age. Tibialis anterior muscle was isolated from four groups of mice (mdx and mdx/MMP-2-/- mice at 1 and 3 months of age). Total RNA was purified and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Affymetrix reagents and protocols.

However, little is know about the mechanisms that control receptor activity. A widely discussed hypothesis states that the intracellular domain (ICD) of megalin, released upon ligand binding, acts as a transcription regulator to suppress receptor expression - a mechanism proposed to safeguard the proximal tubules from protein overload. Here, we have put this hypothesis to the test by generating a mouse model co-expressing the soluble ICD and the full-length receptor. Despite pronounced expression in the proximal tubules, the ICD failed to exert any effects on renal proximal tubular function such as megalin expression, protein retrieval, or renal gene transcription. Thus, our data argue that the ICD does not play a role in regulation of megalin activity in vivo in the proximal tubules. We used microarrays to compare gene expression profile in adult kidney from a new mouse model expressing the intracellular domain of megalin with wildtype. 10 week old mice were collected for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

In both cases, we observed loss of target gene expression, as well as cardiac phenotypes consistent with heart disease in humans, highlighting the functional importance of enhancers for normal heart function, as well as the potential contribution of enhancer mutations to heart disease.

Our previous work showed that, in the absence of TWIST1, some cells within the cranial mesoderm adopt an abnormal epithelial configuration. Here, we show by transcriptome analysis that loss of TWIST1 in the cranial mesoderm is accompanied by a reduction in the expression of genes that are associated with cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of cranial mesoderm-specific Twist1 loss-of-function mutant and control mouse embryos, we identified a set of genes that are both TWIST1-dependent and predominantly expressed in the mesoderm. By ChIP-seq in a cell line model of a TWIST1-dependent mesenchymal state, we identified, among the downstream genes, three direct transcriptional targets of TWIST1: Ddr2, Pcolce and Tgfbi.  Our findings show that the mesenchymal properties of the cranial mesoderm is likely to be regulated by a network of TWIST1 targets genes that influence the extracellular matrix and cell-matrix interactions, and collectively they are required for the morphogenesis of the craniofacial structures. For microarray analysis of CM-CKO embryos, embryo heads of four genotypes were collected at E8.5 (5-7 somites) and E9.5 (18- 20 somites):  CM-CKO (Twist1flox/del; Mesp1Cre/+), CM-Het (Twist1flox/wt; Mesp1Cre/+), Het (Twist1flox/del; Mesp1+/+) and Control (Twist1flox/wt; Mesp1+/+).

We found widespread dysregulation of genes including differential expression of 78 transcription factors or coactivators, several involved in organ development including Hey1, Myf6, Myog, Dlx2, Gli1, Gli2, Lhx2, Pou3f3, Sox2, and Foxp3. We also found that the absence of GTF2IRD1 is associated with increased expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation, including growth factors consistent with the observed phenotype of extreme thickening of the epidermis. At the same time, there was a decrease in the expression of genes involved in other signalling mechanisms, including the Wnt pathway, indicating dysregulation in the complex networks necessary for epidermal differentiation and facial skin patterning. Several of the differentially expressed genes have known roles in both tissue development and neurological function, such as the transcription factor Lhx2 which regulates several genes involved in both skin and brain development. mRNA sequencing of lip tissue from 3 wild type mice (WT) and 3 Gtf2ird1 knockout mice generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics UNSW. ..

The findings suggest that translation of a subset of peroxiomal proteins and other cellular metabolic enzymes may be spatially regulated by directing their encoding mRNAs to the surface of peroxisomes. The study provides foundation for more detailed dissection of mechanisms of RNA targeting to subcellular compartments. In this study we performed the genome-wide transcriptome analysis of peroxisome preparations from the mouse liver using microarrays. We demonstrate that RNA is absent inside peroxisomes, however it is associated at their exterior via the noncovalent contacts with the membrane proteins. We detect enrichment of specific sets of transcripts in two preparations of peroxisomes, purified with different degrees of stringency. Importantly, among these were mRNAs encoding bona fide peroxisomal proteins, such as peroxins and peroxisomal matrix enzymes involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids and bile acid biosynthesis. Two subcellular fractions were obtained from the mouse liver by centrifugation in iodixanol density gradient: 1) Peroxisomal (PX), 2) Mitochondrial/Lysosomal (ML). The membrane-enclosed peroxisomal fraction (PX-IP) was obtained by immuno-precispitation of the PX fraction with the PMP70-specific antibodies. RNA was extracted from each fraction. Additionally, the total cellular RNA was obtained from the whole cell extracts (T). Thus, four RNA sample types were obtained for gene expression analysis: T, ML, PX, PI.

The hippocampus is an important and intriguing part of the forebrain that is crucial in memory formation and retrieval, and that is often affected in epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. Unlike most other parts of the brain, the hippocampus contains a remarkable population of stems cells that continue to generate neurons and glial cells even in adult mammals (Kempermann, 2005). This genetic analysis of transcript expression in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1-CA3) is a joint effort of 14 investigators that is supported by numerous agencies described in the acknowledgments section. Pooled RNA samples (usually one pool of male hippocampii and one pool of female hippocampii) were prepared using standard protocols. Samples were processed using a total of 206 Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Expression 430 2.0 short oligomer arrays (MOE430 2.0 or M430v2; see GEO platform ID GPL1261), of which 201 passed quality control and error checking. This particular data set was processed using the PDNN protocol.

Here we find that, unexpectedly, constitutive activation of mTOR signaling caused by Tsc1 deletion in the oligodendrocyte lineage results in severe myelination defects and oligodendrocyte cell death. Expression profiling analysis reveals that Tsc1 ablation induces prominent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses through the PERK-eIF2alpha dependent signaling axis and activates Fas-JNK apoptotic pathways.

Here, we demonstrate that Arid3a is widely expressed during mouse and human placentation and essential for early embryonic viability. Arid3a is located within trophoblast giant cells and other trophoblast-derived cell subtypes in the junctional and labyrinth zones of the placenta. Conventional Arid3a knockout embryos suffer restricted intrauterine growth with sever defects in placental structural organization. Arid3a null placentas show aberrant expression of subtype-specific markers as well as significant alteration in inflammatory response-related genes, cytokines and chemokines. We provide evidence that BMP4-mediated induction of trophoblast stem (TS)-like cells from human induced pluripotent (iPS) stem cells results in ARID3A upregulation and cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation. Overexpression of ARID3A in human iPS and BMP4-mediated TS-like cells up-regulated TE markers, whereas pluripotent markers were down-regulated. Our results indicate that the roles of Arid3a are conserved and essential for mammalian placental development through regulation of both intrinsic and extrinsic developmental programs.

In this study we examine transcriptional changes occurring the liver in E2f1 (1KI) and E2f3b (3bKI) knock in mice. These mice have E2f1 or E2f3b knocked into the E2F3a locus resulting in loss of E2f3a and expression of E2f1 or E2f3b from the E2f3a locus as originally described In Tsai et. al., Nature 2008. Microarrays were used to evaluate transcriptional changes due to alterations in E2F expression during liver development. Affymetrix microarrays were performed using RNA samples from 4 weeks (1 month)  old livers from wildtype (wt), E2F3a knockout (3aKO) E2f1 knock-in (1KI) and E2f3b knock-in (3bKI) mice. .. 4 weeks (1 month);  E2F1 knock-in;  E2F3b knock-in;  E2f3a knock-out;  wildtype;  total RNA;  1;  2;  liver;  mixed background (FVB/NT, 129S1/Svlmj,C57BL/6NT);  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;

During spleen development, the transcription factor TLX1 controls morphogenesis and organ expansion, and loss of it causes spleen agenesis. However, the downstream signaling pathways that are deregulated in the absence of TLX1 are mostly unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that loss of Tlx1 in the splenic mesenchyme causes increased retinoic acid (RA) signaling. Increased RA activity causes premature differentiation of the splenic mesenchyme and reduced vasculogenesis of the splenic anlage. Moreover, excess or deficiency in RA signaling, as observed in Cyp26b1 or Rdh10 mutants respectively, also results in spleen growth arrest. Genome-wide analysis revealed that TLX1 binds RA-associated genes through the AP-1 site and cooperates with the AP-1 family transcription factors to regulate transcription. Pharmacological inhibition of RA signaling partially rescues the spleen defect. These findings establish the critical role of TLX1 in controlling RA metabolism, and provide novel mechanistic insights into the molecular determinants underlying congenital asplenia.

Expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) from hypertrophy of pre-existing adipocytes and/or differentiation of precursors into new mature adipocytes contributes to obesity. We found that Nck2 expression is largely restricted to WAT, raising the hypothesis that it may play a unique function in that tissue. Using mice lacking Nck2, we found that Nck2 regulates adipocyte hypertrophy thus contributing to increased adiposity and progressive glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. These findings were recapitulated in humans such that Nck2 expression in omental WAT was inversely correlated with the degree of obesity. Mechanistically, Nck2 deficiency promoted the induction of an adipocyte differentiation program and signaling by the PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway in agreement with a role for the unfolded protein response in adipogenesis. These findings uncover Nck2 as a novel regulator of adipogenesis and that perturbation in its functionality contributes to adiposity-related metabolic disorders.

Studies of adipose-specific Glut4 knockout mice have established that adipose Glut4 contributes to the control of systemic glucose homeostasis. Presumably, this reflects a role for Glut4-mediated glucose transport in the regulation of secreted adipokines. In cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Rab10 GTPase is required for insulin-stimulated translocation of Glut4 (Sano et al., 2007). The physiological importance of adipose Rab10 and the significance of its role in the control of Glut4 vesicle trafficking in vivo are unknown. Here we report that adipocytes from adipose-specific Rab10 knockout mice have a ~50% reduction in glucose uptake and Glut4 translocation to the cell surface in response to insulin, demonstrating a role for Rab10 in Glut4 trafficking.  Moreover, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp shows decreased whole-body glucose uptake as well as impaired suppression of hepatic glucose production in adipose Rab10 knockout mice. Thus, fully functional Glut4 vesicle trafficking in adipocytes is critical for maintaining insulin sensitivity. Comparative transcriptome analysis of perigonadal adipose tissue demonstrates significant transcriptional similarities between adipose Rab10 knockout mice and adipose Glut4 knockout mice, consistent with the notion that the phenotypic similarities between the two models are mediated by reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport into adipocytes.

Setdb1 is a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase required for post-implantation development and has been implicated in the transcriptional silencing of genes and endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs). To address its role in oogenesis and pre-implantation development, we conditionally deleted Setdb1 in growing oocytes. Loss of Setdb1 expression greatly impaired meiosis. It delayed meiotic resumption, altered the dynamics of chromatin condensation, and impaired kinetochore-spindle interactions, bipolar spindle organization, and chromosome segregation in more mature oocytes. The observed phenotypes related to changes in abundance of specific transcripts in mutant oocytes. Setdb1 maternally deficient embryos arrested during pre-implantation development and showed comparable defects during cell cycle progression and in chromosome segregation. Finally, transcriptional profiling data indicate that Setdb1 down-regulates rather than silences expression of ERVK and ERVL-MaLR retrotransposons and associated chimeric transcripts during oogenesis. Our results identify Setdb1 as a novel meiotic and embryonic competence factor in meiosis and mitosis, safeguarding genome integrity at the onset of life. We performed expression profiling on pools of 16 denuded GV-oocytes isolated per mouse.

However, their expression dynamics and  modifications are poorly understood because of the scarcity of RNA that is obtainable for sequencing analysis.  Using an improved deep sequencing method that requires as little as 10 ng of total RNA or 50 oocytes, we  profile small RNAs in mouse oocytes and early embryos. We find that microRNA (miRNA) expression starts soon  after fertilization, and the mature miRNAs carried into the zygote by sperm during fertilization are relatively  rare compared to the oocyte miRNAs. Intriguingly, the zygotic miRNAs display a marked increase in 3' mono-  and oligoadenylation in one- to two-cell embryos, which may protect the miRNAs from the massive degradation  taking place during that time. Moreover, bioinformatics analyses show that the function of miRNA is suppressed  from the oocyte to the two-cell stage and appears to be reactivated after the two-cell stage to regulate genes  important in embryonic development. Our study thus provides a highly sensitive profiling method and valuable  data sets for further examination of small RNAs in early embryos.

To investigate these pathways we   analyzed the brain of B6J-nmf205-/-   mice in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA   codons due to deficiencies in a tRNA  Arg(UCU) tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor.   Increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2alpha (Ser51) were detected prior to neurodegeneration in these   mice and transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the   integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Genetic experiments showed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2alpha kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Further we found that the ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in B6J-nmf205-/-   mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway.   These results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress.

Although several key regulators in growth plate development have been identified using primarily genetic perturbation, the systematic understanding is still limited. Here we used single cell RNA-seq to interrogate gene expression profiles of 217 single cells from growth plates, and developed the bioinformatics pipeline Sinova to de-novo reconstruct physiological growth plate development in both temporal and spatial high-resolution. Our unsupervised model not only confirmed prior knowledge but also enabled systematic discovery of novel genes, potential signal pathways and surface markers CD9/CD200 to precisely depict the development. Sinova further identified effective transcriptional factor portfolio directing growth plate maturation, which was cross-validated experimentally using an in-vitro EGFP-Col10a screening system.

Analysis of this variation across a population of genetically distinct individuals allows us to visualize a network of co-expressed genes under normal homeostatic conditions, and the consequences of perturbation by tissue damage or disease development. Here, we explore gene expression networks in normal adult skin from 470 genetically unique mice, and demonstrate the dependence of the architecture of signaling pathways on skin tissue location (dorsal or tail skin) and perturbation by induction of inflammation or tumorigenesis. Gene networks related to specific cell types, as well as signaling pathways including Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, Lgr family stem cell markers, and keratins differed at these tissue sites, suggesting mechanisms for the differential susceptibility of dorsal and tail skin to development of skin diseases and tumorigenesis. The Pten tumor suppressor gene network is extensively rewired in premalignant tumors compared to normal tissue, but this response to perturbation is lost during malignant progression.

The present study compared the effect of a mouse viable 30 Mb segmental trisomy on the genome-wide transcriptional profile of somatic (liver) cells and male germ cells. While the 1.6-fold change in expression of triplicated genes reflected the gene dosage in liver cells, the extra copy was almost fully compensated in early pachytene spermatocytes, showing 1.18-fold increase. Allele-specific semi-quantitative evaluation of steady-state mRNA levels of the triplicated Amdhd2 gene revealed silencing evenly distributed among all three copies in these meiotic cells. Although more pronounced, the dosage compensation of trisomic genes was concordant with the incidence of HORMAD2 and gammaH2AX markers of unsynapsed chromatin. The possible explanations include insufficient sensitivity to detect both MSUC markers in the 30 Mb region of the chromosome, or an early silencing effect of another epigenetic factor. Taken together, our results indicate that the meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin is the major but not the only factor driving the dosage compensation of triplicated genes in primary spermatocytes.

Using high-resolution MeCP2 binding data, we show that genetic features alone can predict binding with 88% accuracy. Integrating MeCP2 binding and DNA methylation in a probabilistic graphical model, we demonstrate that previously reported methylation preferences may be due to MeCP2's affinity to GC-rich chromatin, a result replicated using published data. Furthermore, MeCP2 co-localized with nucleosomes, and Mecp2 deletion led to nucleosome repositioning. Finally, MeCP2 binding downstream of promoters correlated with increased expression in Mecp2 deficient neurons.

Formerly obese individuals are susceptible to metabolic disorders later in life, even after lifestyle changes are made to mitigate the obese state. This is reminiscent of the metabolic memory phenomenon originally observed for persistent complications in diabetic patients, despite subsequent glycemic control. Epigenetic modifications represent a potential mediator of this observed memory. We previously demonstrated that a high fat (HF) diet leads to changes in chromatin accessibility in the mouse liver. The regions of greatest chromatin changes in accessibility are largely strain dependent, indicating a genetic component in diet-induced chromatin alterations. We have now examined the persistence of diet-induced chromatin accessibility changes upon diet reversal in two strains of mice. We find that a substantial fraction of loci that undergo chromatin accessibility changes with HF diet remain in the remodeled state after diet reversal in C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, the vast majority of diet-induced chromatin accessibility changes in A/J mice are transient. Our data also indicate that the persistent chromatin accessibility changes observed in C57BL/6J are associated with specific transcription factors and histone posttranslational modifications. The persistent loci identified here are likely to be contributing to the overall phenotype and are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

Children with intellectual disability (ID) tend to have sleep-wake disturbances, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. As far as sleep is, in part, a circadian process, we decided to study rhythmic gene expression in hippocampus, a brain structure, which plays a key role in memory in human and rodents. By investigating the transcriptome of mouse adult hippocampus, we report here the identification of 663 circadian rhythm (CR)-regulated genes, which have been clustered in four categories, based on their temporal pattern of expression. In addition to the standard core-clock genes, enrichment analysis of the hippocampal CR-regulated genes revealed the presence of several transcription factors, underlying the existence of an inter-regulation of genes' expression between clusters. Interestingly, these hippocampal circadian rhythm-regulated genes are very enriched in sleep/wakefulness related genes. We show here that glucocorticoid signaling, already shown to be involved in memory regulation, is a circadian regulated pathway in hippocampus. Furthermore, we identified a list of 30 CR-regulated ID genes. Our results demonstrate that hippocampus can be considered as a peripheral oscillator and illustrate the link between circadian rhythm, sleep, intellectual disability and memory consolidation. In order to identify circadian rhythm-regulated genes in mouse hippocampus, we realized a study in dark-dark conditions, thus allowing to overcome the effects induced by light changes. To systematically identify genes with circadian regulated expression, RNA samples from the hippocampus of three mice at four Circadian Time (CT) points were used for expression profiling using Agilent microarray technology. The dark/dark period started at 7 p.m. The Circadian Time (CT) 18 samples were taken after 30 h of continuous dark; the other circadian times followed at 6-h intervals: CT0, CT6 and CT12 after 36, 42 and 48 h of continuous darkness, respectively. .. 0;  12;  18;  6;  adult;  male;  wild-type;  total RNA;  Hippocampus, CT0;  Hippocampus, CT12;  Hippocampus, CT18;  Hippocampus, CT6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  hippocampus;  Dark-dark conditions.;

Here we dissected the role of DNA methylation in trophoblast development by performing mRNA and DNA methylation profiling of Dnmt3a/3b-null trophoblast. We find that most gene deregulation is explained by an erasure of maternal methylation in the oocyte, but partially independent of loss of imprinting of the trophoblast-essential Ascl2 gene.

Several are more common or severe in males (e.g., autism and schizophrenia) or females (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and depression). We analyzed transcriptomic data from the mouse hippocampus of six inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, DBA/1J, DBA/2J and PWD/Ph), to provide a perspective on differences between male and female gene expression. Our data show that: 1) significant gene expression differences in males versus females varies substantially across the strains, 2) 12 genes exist that are differentially expressed across the inbred strains (termed core genes), and 3) there are >2,600 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the strains (termed non-core genes). We found that DBA/2J uniquely has a substantial majority (89%) of DEGs that are more highly expressed in females than males; 129/SvImJ is the most strongly male-biased with a majority (69%) of DEGs that are more highly expressed in males. To gain insight into the sex-biased DEGs, we examined gene ontology, pathway and phenotype enrichment and found significant enrichment in phenotypes related to abnormal nervous system morphology and physiology, among others. In addition, several pathways are enriched significantly, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), with 32 genes implicated in AD, 8 of which are male-biased. Three of the male-biased genes have been implicated in a neuroprotective role in AD.

Furthermore, it is expected that the many physiological changes accompanying pregnancy and postpartum stages will impact brain gene expression patterns. To understand how extensive these gene expression changes are, we examined the global transcriptional response broadly, by examining four different brain regions: hypothalamus, hippocampus, neocortex, and cerebellum.  Further, to understand the time course of these changes we performed RNA-sequencing analyses on mRNA derived from virgin females, two pregnancy time points and three postpartum time points.  We find that each brain region and time point shows a unique molecular signature, with only 49 genes differentially expressed in all four regions, across the time points.  Additionally, several genes previously implicated in underlying postpartum depression change expression. This study serves as a comprehensive atlas of gene expression changes in the maternal brain in the cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and neocortex. At each of the time points analyzed, all four brain regions show extensive changes, suggesting that pregnancy, parturition, and postpartum maternal experience substantially impacts diverse brain regions.

Here we show that Smyd3 expression in mice is required but not sufficient for chemically induced liver and colon cancer formation. In these organs Smyd3 is functioning in the nucleus as a direct transcriptional activator of several key genes involved in cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, JAK/Stat3 oncogenic pathways, as well as of the c-myc and b-catenin oncogenes. Smyd3 specifically interacts with H3K4Me3-modified histone tails and is recruited to the core promoter regions of many but not all active genes. Smyd3 binding density on target genes positively correlates with increased RNA Pol-II density and transcriptional outputs. The results suggest that Smyd3 is an essential transcriptional potentiator of a multitude of cancer-related genes. Standard Smyd3-deficient (Smyd3-KO) mice were generated using gene-trap ES cell clones (AS0527 from International Gene Trap Consortium), in which a selection cassette, containing the splice acceptor site from mouse EN2 exon 2 followed by the beta-galactosidase and neomycin resistance gene fusion gene and the SV40 polyadenylation sequence was inserted into the 5th intron of the Smyd3 gene. The resulting mice were devoid of Smyd3 mRNA and protein in all tissues, including liver and colon. For the generation of Smyd3-Tg mice the open reading frame of the mouse Smyd3 cDNA, which contained 3 Flag epitopes at the 3' end was inserted into the StuI site of the pTTR1-ExV3 plasmid (Yan et al, 1990). The 6.8 kb HindIII fragment containing the mouse transthyretin enhancer/promoter, intron 1, Smyd3 cDNA, three Flag epitopes and SV40 poly-A site was used to microinject C57Bl/6 fertilized oocytes.

Pejvakin-deficient (Pjvk-/-) mice also exhibited variable auditory phenotypes. Correlation between their hearing thresholds and the number of pups per cage suggested a possible harmful effect of pup vocalizations. Direct sound or electrical stimulation showed that the cochlear sensory hair cells and auditory pathway neurons of Pjvk-/- mice and patients were exceptionally vulnerable to sound. Pjvk-/- cochleas displayed features of marked oxidative stress and impaired anti-oxidant defenses. We showed that pejvakin is associated with peroxisomes, and is required for the oxidative stress-induced proliferation of these organelles. In Pjvk-/- hair cells, peroxisomes displayed structural abnormalities after the onset of hearing. Noise-exposure of wild-type mice rapidly upregulated Pjvk cochlear transcription, and triggered peroxisome proliferation in hair cells and primary auditory neurons. Our results reveal that the anti-oxidant activity of peroxisomes protects the auditory system against noise-induced damage.

Here we demonstrate that in the mouse embryonic male germline, endonucleolytic cleavage (slicing) of a transcript by cytosolic MILI acts as a trigger to initiate its further 5'3' processing into non-overlapping fragments. These fragments accumulate as new piRNAs within the nuclear PIWI protein MIWI2. We identify Exonuclease domain-containing 1 (EXD1) as a partner of the established MIWI2 piRNA biogenesis factor TDRD12. Although EXD1 homodimers are inactive as a nuclease, it functions as an RNA adapter within a PET (PIWI-EXD1-Tdrd12) complex. Loss of Exd1 impacts biogenesis of MIWI2 piRNAs and displays a reduction in sequences generated by MILI slicing. This results in selective depletion of repeat piRNAs that target active retrotransposons like LINE1, which are de-repressed in the mutant. We propose that PIWI slicing and EXD1 promote coordination of nucleo-cytoplasmic silencing via piRNA biogenesis. Immunoprecipitated or total small RNAs were purified and sequenced from P0 mouse testis of Exd1+/- and Exd1 -/- mice. Testes of three males were pooled together and MILI and MIWI2 immunoprecipitation was performed or  total small RNAs were purified. Two replicas from different pools were prepared.

This process involves epigenetic control mechanisms, such as those mediated by the polycomb group protein Ezh2 that catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3K27 (H3K27me3) and thereby represses gene expression.  Results:  Here we show that Ezh2 plays a crucial role in development and maintenance of the midbrain. Conditional deletion of Ezh2 in the developing midbrain resulted in decreased neural progenitor proliferation, which is associated with derepression of cell cycle inhibitors and negative regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Of note, Ezh2 ablation also promoted ectopic expression of a forebrain transcriptional program involving derepression of the forebrain determinants Foxg1 and Pax6. This was accompanied by reduced expression of midbrain markers, including Pax3 and Pax7, as a consequence of decreased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Conclusion:  Ezh2 is required for appropriate brain growth and for maintenance of regional identity by H3K27me3-mediated gene repression and control of canonical Wnt signaling.

The transcription factor, SOX9, is highly expressed in the cardiac cushion mesenchyme, and is essential for heart valve development. Loss of Sox9 in mouse cardiac cushion mesenchyme alters cell proliferation, embryonic survival, and disrupts valve formation. Despite this important role, little is known regarding how SOX9 regulates heart valve formation or its transcriptional targets. Therefore, we mapped putative SOX9 binding sites by ChIP-Seq in embryonic day (E) 12.5 heart valves, a stage at which the valve mesenchyme is actively proliferating and initiating differentiation. Embryonic heart valves have been shown to express a high number of genes that are associated with chondrogenesis, including several extracellular matrix proteins and transcription factors that regulate chondrogenesis. Consequently, we compared regions of putative SOX9 DNA-binding between E12.5 heart valves and E12.5 limb buds. We identified context-dependent and context-independent SOX9 interacting regions throughout the genome. Analysis of context-independent SOX9 binding suggests an extensive role for SOX9 across tissues in regulating proliferation-associated genes including key components of the AP-1 complex. Integrative analysis of tissue-specific SOX9 interacting regions and gene expression profiles on Sox9-deficient heart valves demonstrated that SOX9 controls the expression of several transcription factors with previously identified roles in heart valve development, including Twist1, Sox4, Mecom/Evi1 and Pitx2. Together, our data identifies SOX9 coordinated transcriptional hierarchies that control cell proliferation and differentiation during valve formation.

Notably, 3272 proteins were quantifiable and 525 identified as differentially expressed in mdx muscle (P < 0.01). Therapeutic restoration of dystrophin by exon skipping induced widespread shifts in protein and mRNA expression towards wild-type expression levels, whereas the miRNome was largely unaffected. Comparison analyses between datasets showed that protein and mRNA ratios were only weakly correlated (r = 0.405), and identified a multitude of differentially affected cellular pathways, upstream regulators and predicted miRNA-target interactions.

This disease is associated with elevated maternal bile acids and frequently untoward neonatal outcomes such as respiratory distress and asphyxia. Multiple candidate genes have been implicated, but none have provided insight into the mechanisms of neonatal respiratory distress and death. Herein our studies demonstrate that maternal cholestasis (due to Abcb11 deficiency) produces 100% neonatal death within 24h due to atelectasis producing pulmonary hypoxia, which recapitulates the respiratory distress and asphyxia of human ICP. We show that these neonates have elevated pulmonary bile acids that are associated with disrupted structure of pulmonary surfactant. Maternal absence of Nr1i2 superimposed upon Abcb11 deficiency strongly increased neonatal survival and is directly related to reduced maternal bile acid concentrations. The mechanism accounting for reduced serum bile acids in the mothers deficient in both Nr1i2 and Abcb11 appears related to disrupted reabsorption of intestinal bile acids due to changes in transporter expression. These findings provide novel insights into pulmonary failure by revealing bile acids capability to disrupt the structure of surfactant producing collapsed alveoli, pulmonary failure and ultimately death. These findings have important implications for neonatal health especially when maternal bile acids are elevated during pregnancy and highlight a potential pathway and targets amenable to therapeutic intervention to ameliorate this condition. We used microarrays to measure changes in gene expression profiles in lung tissues from Abcb11+/- lungs after interbreeding C57BL/6 wild-type female or C57BL/6 Abcb11-/- female mice against either C57BL/6 wild-type male mice or C57BL/6 Abcb11-/- male mice to create only heterozygote offspring.

As pregnancy progresses mammary signature genes are activated in a defined temporal order, which coincides with the recruitment of STAT5 to respective regulatory sequences. This study addressed the question whether the methyltransferase and transcriptional co-activator EZH2 controls the differentiation clock of mammary epithelium. Ablation of Ezh2 from mammary stem cells resulted in precocious differentiation of alveolar epithelium during pregnancy and the activation of mammary-specific STAT5 target genes. This coincided with enhanced occupancy by STAT5, EZH1 and Pol II to these loci. Limited activation of differentiation-specific genes was also observed in mammary epithelium lacking both EZH2 and STAT5, suggesting a modulating but not mandatory role for STAT5. Notably, loss of EZH2 did not result in overt changes in genome-wide and gene-specific H3K27me3 patterns, suggesting that enhanced EZH1 recruitment can compensate for the loss of EZH2. Differentiated mammary epithelia failed to form in the combined absence of EZH1 and EZH2. Transplantation experiments failed to demonstrate a role for EZH2 in the biology of mammary stem and progenitor cells. In summary, while EZH1 and EZH2 serve redundant functions in the establishment of H3K27me3 and formation of mammary alveoli, the presence of EZH2 is required to obtain controlled temporal differentiation of mammary epithelium. mRNA-seq in WT;MMTV-Cre (Control) at p13 and p18, E1-/- (E1KO), Ezh2f/f;MMTV-Cre(E2KO), Stat5f/f;MMTV-Cre(S5KO), and Ezh2f/f;Stat5f/f;MMTV-Cre (E2S5DKO) at p13 mammary tissues.

In the mammalian kidney, reciprocal signaling between three lineages (stromal, mesenchymal and ureteric) ensures correct nephron progenitor self-renewal and differentiation. Loss of either the atypical cadherin Fat4 or its ligand Dachsous1 (Dchs1) results in expansion of the mesenchymal nephron progenitor pool, called the condensing mesenchyme (CM). This has been proposed to be due to misregulation of the Hippo kinase pathway transcriptional co-activator YAP. Here, we use tissue-specific deletions to prove that Fat4 acts non-autonomously in the renal stroma to control nephron progenitors. We show that loss of Yap from the CM in a Fat4-null background does not reduce the expanded CM, indicating Fat4 regulates the CM independent of YAP. Analysis of Six2-/-;Fat4-/- double mutants demonstrates that excess progenitors in Fat4 mutants are dependent on Six2, a critical regulator of nephron progenitor self-renewal. Electron microscopy reveals that cell organization is disrupted in Fat4 mutants. Gene expression analysis demonstrates that the expression of  Notch and FGF pathway components are altered in Fat4 mutants. Finally, we show that Dchs1, and its paralog Dchs2 function in a partially redundant fashion to regulate the number of nephron progenitors. Our data supports a model in which FAT4 in the stroma binds to DCHS1/2 in the CM to restrict progenitor self-renewal.

VDR regulates epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation by modulating gene transcription, whereas the CaSR, a member of the family C G-protein coupled receptor, calcium mobilizes intracellular calcium and induces the formation of cell-cell junctions. 1,25D3 augments the sensitivity of the prodifferentiating actions of calcium by increasing the expression of CaSR. CaSR- and VDR-deficient keratinocytes share common characteristics such as abnormal intercellular adhesion and sphigolipid metabolism. Both CaSR and VDR are abundantly expressed in epidermal stem cell populations including CD34 expressing bulge keratinocytes in hair follicles and basal cells in interfollicular epidermis. To delineate the role of CaSR- and VDR-dependent pathways in regulating epidermal development and functions in physiological state, we generated conditional CaSR-null and VDR-null mice, where Casr and VDR gene was removed from keratinocytes. Keratinocyte-specific CaSR-null and VDR-null mice manifest distinct phenotypes. CaSR-null mice display defective epidermal permeability barrier function due to aberrant keratinocyte differentiation. VDR-null mice develop alopecia after completing the first hair follicle cycling. Concurrent ablation of CaSR and VDR genes in keratinocytes delays rate of wound repair and increases incidence of skin tumor formation to a greater extent than deletion of the CaSR or VDR alone, indicative of synergistic effects of calcium and 1,25D3 signaling. Gene expression profiles and subsequent pathway analysis on the epidermis derived from 5-day-old neonates revealed that ablation of CaSR or VDR increased expression of genes associated with cancer progression and metastasis. Deletion of VDR markedly inhibited signaling pathways that regulate hair development. Furthermore, concurrent ablation of CaSR and VDR significantly suppressed calcium, VDR, Wnt/b-catenin signaling, as well as epithelial adherence junction signaling to maintain appropriate keratinocyte adhesion. These results indicated the interplay of calcium/CaSR and 1,25D3/VDR signaling in keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, and their importance in maintaining normal epidermal adhesion and functions. n=3 CON and KO (each sample contain RNA isolated from neonatal epidermis separated from 3 mice) ..

Toxicity is thought to result from enhanced binding of proteins to these expansions and depletion from their normal cellular targets. However, experimental evidence for this sequestration model is lacking. Here, we use HITS-CLIP and pre-mRNA processing analysis of human control versus myotonic dystrophy (DM) brains to provide compelling evidence for this RNA toxicity model. MBNL2 binds directly to DM repeat expansions in the brain resulting in depletion from its normal RNA targets with downstream effects on alternative splicing and polyadenylation. Similar RNA processing defects were detected in Mbnl compound knockout mice, highlighted by dysregulation of Mapt splicing and fetal tau isoform expression in adults. These results demonstrate that MBNL proteins are directly sequestered by RNAexp in the DM brain and introduce a powerful experimental tool to evaluate RNA-mediated toxicity in other expansion diseases. HITS-CLIP analysis was performed to identify RNA binding sites of MBNL2 in control, DM type 1 (DM1), and DM type 2 (DM2) autopsy-derived brain (n=3).  Two regions of the brain selected for the study included the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Libraries were sequenced and wiggle files were generated for each biological replicate as well as three pooled biological replicates (3BRs) per group (control, DM1, and DM2).  In addition, differential CLIP analysis (dCLIP) was performed to normalize binding data between groups and identify statistically significant changes in binding.  The dCLIP analysis generated bedgraph files representing normalized binding profiles of MBNL2 in each group (control, DM1, and DM2) for visualization and comparative analysis. PolyA-seq was performed on control, DM1, and DM2 autopsy-derived brain samples (hippocampus and frontal cortex, n=3) as well as wild-type (WT) and Mbnl1; Mbnl2 conditional double knockout (Mbnl1-/-; Mbnl2c/c; Nestin-Cre+/- or DKO) brain (n=3).  Libraries were sequenced and the resultant files were processed and aligned to the reference genomes (hg19 and mm10).  Further computational processing was performed to remove internal oligo(dT) mis-priming events, identify valid polyA sites, and trim to the exact polyA sites.

This dynamic environment is, in turn, created by the combined secretory and absorptive activity of the surrounding epithelium and displays an extraordinary level of regionalization. Although the regulatory network responsible for spatial coordination of epididymal function remains unclear, recent evidence has highlighted a novel role for the RNA interference pathway. Indeed, as noncanonical regulators of gene expression, small noncoding RNAs have emerged as key elements of the circuitry involved in regulating epididymal function and hence sperm maturation. Herein we have employed next generation sequencing technology to profile the genome-wide miRNA signatures of mouse epididymal cells and characterize segmental patterns of expression. An impressive profile of some 370 miRNAs were detected in the mouse epididymis, with a subset of these specifically identified within the epithelial cells that line the tubule (218).  A majority of the latter miRNAs (75%) were detected at equivalent levels along the entire length of the mouse epididymis. We did however identify a small cohort of miRNAs that displayed highly regionalized patterns of expression, including miR-204-5p and miR-196b-5p, which were down- and up-regulated by approximately 39- and 45-fold between the caput/caudal regions, respectively. In addition we identified 79 miRNAs (representing ~ 21% of all miRNAs) as displaying conserved expression within all regions of the mouse, rat and human epididymal tissue. These included 8/14 members of let-7 family of miRNAs that have been widely implicated in the control of androgen signaling and the repression of cell proliferation and oncogenic pathways.  Overall these data provide novel insights into the sophistication of the miRNA network that regulates the function of the male reproductive tract.

The mutant mice are of mixed genetic background of C57BL/6J, 129 and CD-1 strains.  The head of E10.5 embryos was collected and embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature resin (Tissue-Tek) by flash freezing on dry ice. The frozen sections were collected on polyethylene naphthalate membrane slides (Leica). Leica LMD6000 Laser Micro-Dissection System was used to cut out the normal expression domain of Lhx6 and Lhx8 in the maxillary arch mesenchyme. The tissue was collected from the entire antero-posterior extent of the maxillary arches. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).

The goals of this study were firstly, to identify ADAR1-specific RNA-editing sites by identifying A-to-I (G) mismatches in RNA-seq data compared to mm9 reference genome in wild type mice that were not edited or reduced in editing frequency in ADAR1E861A editing deficient mice. Secondly, to determine the transcriptional consequence of an absence of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing. Methods: Fetal liver mRNA profiles of embryonic day 12.5 wild-type (WT) and ADAR1 editing-deficient (ADAR1E861A) mice were generated by RNA sequencing, in triplicate (biological replicates), using Illumina HiSeq2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT-PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. A-to-I (G) RNA editing sites were identified as previously described by Ramaswami G. et al., Nature Methods, 2012 using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA). RNA editing sites were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 14,484 transcripts in the fetal livers of WT and ADAR1E861A mice with BWA. RNA-seq data had a goodness of fit (R2) of >0.94 between biological triplicates per genotype. Approximately 4.4% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and ADAR1E861A fetal liver, with a LogFC=>1.5 and p value <0.05. A profound upregulation of interferon stimulated genes were found to be massively upregulated (up to 11 logFC) in ADAR1E861A fetal liver compared to WT. 6,012 A-to-I RNA editing sites were identified when assessing mismatches in RNA-seq data of WT and ADAR1E861A fetal liver. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of fetal liver transcriptomes and A-to-I RNA editing sites, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. A-to-I RNA editing is the essential function of ADAR1 and is required to suppress interferon signaling to endogenous RNA.

Imprinted genes have been categorized into two groups: multi lineage (ML) imprinted genes that can show imprinted expression in both embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages, and genes that show extra-embryonic lineage (EXEL) specific imprinted expression restricted to tissues like the placenta and visceral yolk sac (VYS) endoderm. Many genes showing EXEL imprinted expression are silenced by lncRNAs that act over long distances. Thus the analysis of this form of gene silencing is likely to be pivotal for understanding new mechanisms of long range gene silencing by lncRNAs. It has been reported that ES cells differentiated into cystic embryoid bodies (cystic EBs) contain VYS endoderm and here we investigate if cystic EBs could serve as an in vitro model for the analysis of EXEL imprinted expression. Unexpectedly we found that cystic EBs lack EXEL imprinted expression, while retaining normal imprinted expression of ML genes. This shows that cystic EBs do not model VYS imprinted expression and also argues against previous claims that cystic EBs contain VYS endoderm. We further characterized cystic EBs by performing RNA-seq and whole genome bisulphite sequencing. By comparison to various embryonic tissues we found that cystic EBs more resemble embryonic liver, which contains definitive endoderm, than the extra-embryonic endoderm of the VYS.

In addition to their roles in post-transcriptional TE repression, both proteins are required for DNA methylation of TE sequences. Here we analyzed the effect of Miwi2 deficiency on piRNA biogenesis and transposon repression. Miwi2-deficiency had only a minor impact on piRNA biogenesis; however, the piRNA profile of Miwi2-knockout mice indicated overexpression of several LINE1 TE families that led to activation of the ping-pong piRNA cycle. Furthermore, we found that MILI and MIWI2 have distinct functions in TE repression in the nucleus. MILI is responsible for DNA methylation of a larger subset of TE families than MIWI2 suggesting that the proteins have independent roles in establishing DNA methylation patterns.

In the developing forebrain, Pax6 is expressed in ventricular zone precursor cells and in specific subpopulations of neurons; absence of Pax6 results in disrupted cell proliferation and cell fate specification. Pax6 also regulates the entire lens developmental program. To reconstruct Pax6-dependent gene regulatory networks (GRNs), ChIP-seq studies were performed using lens and forebrain chromatin from mice. A total of 3,723 (forebrain) and 3,514 (lens) Pax6-containing peaks were identified, with ~70% of them found in both tissues and thereafter called    common    peaks. Analysis of Pax6-bound peaks identified motifs that closely resemble Pax6-PD, -PD/HD and -HD established binding sequences. Mapping of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and RNA polymerase II revealed distinct types of tissue-specific enhancers bound by Pax6. Pax6 directly regulates cortical neurogenesis through activation (e.g. Dmrta1 and Ngn2) and repression (e.g. Ascl1, Fezf2, and Gsx2) of transcription factors. In lens, Pax6 directly regulates cell cycle exit control via components of FGF (Fgfr2, Ccnd1, and Prox1) and Wnt (Dkk3, Wnt7a, Lrp6, Bcl9l, and Ccnd1) signaling pathways. Collectively, these studies provide genome-wide analysis of Pax6-dependent GRNs in lens and forebrain and establish novel roles of Pax6 in organogenesis.

In the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) mTORC2 ensures normal vascular reactivity by controlling expression of inflammatory molecules. To assess whether RICTOR/mTORC2 contributes to blood pressure regulation, we applied a radiotelemetry approach in control and Rictor knockout (RictoraP2KO) mice generated by using adipocyte protein-2 gene promoter-driven CRE recombinase to delete Rictor. 24 hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) was increased in RictoraP2KO mice, and the physiologic decline in MAP during the dark period impaired. In parallel, heart rate and locomotor activity were elevated during the dark period with a pattern similar to blood pressure changes. This phenotype was associated with mild cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, decreased cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) and NP receptor expression in adipocytes. Moreover, clock gene expression was dampened or phase-shifted in PVAT. No differences in clock gene expression were observed in the master clock suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), though Rictor gene expression was also lower in brain of RictoraP2KO mice. Thus, the present study underscores the importance of RICTOR/mTORC2 for interactions between vasculature, adipocytes and brain to tune physiological outcomes such as blood pressure and locomotion.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, non-coding small RNAs, has been found to introduce a whole new layer of gene regulation in eukaryotes. The anti-schistosomiasis mechanosm of M. fortis may require the participation of miRNA-mediated gene expression. In the present study, the difference pathological change of different tissue such as liver, spleen and lung of M. fortis were observed by using haematoxylin-eosin staining. Also, the miRNA expression in different tissue of M. fortis and mice before challenge and 10 days post-infection with schistosomes were first compared using microRNA microarray analysis. Histological analyses showed that S. japonicum infection in M. fortis resulted in more intensive inflammatory response and pathologic change than mice. The microarray investigations showed that 388 miRNAs detected common expressed in the two species, and 11 miRNAs in liver, 25 miRNAs in spleen and 28 miRNAs in lung differentially expressed in non-permissive M. fortis while increased, decreased or nearly fixed in mice. Further studies of the differentially expressed miRNAs demonstrated that many important signal pathway were triggered after the S. japonicum infection in M. fortis rather than the mouse, such as the metabolism of some nutrient material such as fatty-acid, cholesterol, lipid, insulin, and carbohydrate; immune response such as B and T cell differentiation, monocyte differentiation, the inflammation, NF-kappaB binding, even the in innate immune system; Cell differentiation and apoptosis such as erythrocytic differentiation and targeting proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. These results may provide new insights into general mechanisms of regulation in non-permissive M. fortis, exploit the potential miRNA regulatory networks and the interaction between parasites and different hosts, which provide valuable new information on schistosome biology and valuable information for the better understanding of schistosome development and host-parasite interactions.

Although testis and ovary arise from a common embryonic primordium, they represent outcomes of opposing fate determination. This decision to differentiate into a testis or an ovary hinges upon the balance between two antagonizing factors, pro-testis SOX9 and pro-ovary beta-catenin. This microarray analysis led to the identification of the genes involved in the fate of XX and XY gonads in absence of SOX9 and beta-catenin We developed mouse genetic models that lack either Sox9, beta-catenin, or both specifically in the somatic cells.

To explore this, we generated 72 genome-wide RNA-seq profiles from mouse eight-cell embryos, late gestation and adult livers, together with 4 ground-state pluripotent embryonic (ES) cell lines from which we generated both RNA-seq and multiple ChIP-seq profiles. We complemented this with previously published data to yield 5 snap-shots of pre-implantation development, late-gestation placenta and somatic tissue and multiple adult tissues for integrative analysis. We define a high-confidence sex-dimorphic signature of 56 genes in eight-cell embryos. Sex-chromosome-linked components of this signature are largely conserved throughout pre-implantation development and ES cells, whilst the autosomal component is more dynamic. Sex-biased gene expression is reflected by enrichment for activating and repressive histone modifications. The eight-cell signature is largely non-overlapping with that defined from fetal liver, neither was it correlated with liver or other adult tissues analysed. Fetal and adult liver gene expression signatures are also substantially different, yet a core set of common genes showing modest dimorphic expression was identified. Dramatic sex-specific expression of olfactory receptors was found in fetal liver. Sex-biased expression differences unique to adult liver were enriched for growth hormone-responsiveness. The majority of sex-chromosome based differences identified from eight-cell embryos are also present in placenta but not somatic tissue at the same gestational age. This systematic study identifies three distinct phases of sex dimorphism throughout mouse development, and has significant implications for understanding the developmental origins of sex-specific phenotypes and disease in mammals.

Therefore, it is of particular interest to investigate the sense of smell, its function on a molecular level, the signaling proteins involved in the process and the mechanism of required ion transport. In recent years, the precise role of the ion transporter NKCC1 in olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) chloride accumulation has been a controversial subject. NKCC1 is expressed in OSNs and is involved in chloride accumulation of dissociated neurons, but it had not been shown to play a role in mouse odorant sensation.  To characterize transporter gene expression in NKCC1-/- mice, we examined the OE gene profile (Supplementary Table 1) using Illumina RNA-Seq to generate OE transcriptomes from NKCC1-/- and wild type mice. We analyzed RNA from OEs of male and female NKCC1+/+ (12   1 weeks) and NKCC1-/- mice (16.5   3.5 weeks, NMRI background); each RNA sample was prepared from an OE pool of 4 (mixed-gender pool RNA isolation) or 2 (gender RNA pool) different mice for each condition. Our data demonstrated the absence of a highly expressed ion transporter that could compensate for NKCC1. The Illumina RNA-Seq protocol was utilized.

Despite their abundance, their function and expression in the nervous system are unknown. Therefore, we sequenced RNA from different brain regions, primary neurons, isolated synapses, as well as during neuronal differentiation. Using these and other available data, we discovered and analyzed thousands of neuronal human and mouse circRNAs. circRNAs were extraordinarily enriched in the mammalian brain, well conserved in sequence, often expressed as circRNAs in both human and mouse, and sometimes even detected in Drosophila brains. circRNAs were overall upregulated during neuronal differentiation, highly enriched in synapses, and often differentially expressed compared to their mRNA isoforms. circRNA expression correlated negatively with expression of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1. Knockdown of ADAR1 induced elevated circRNA expression. Together, we provide a circRNA brain expression atlas and evidence for important circRNA functions and values as biomarkers. To assess circRNA expression in mammalian brain, we sequenced and analyzed mouse brain regions (hippocampus, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex and olfactory bulb), various neuronal differentiation (mouse P19 and human SH-SY5Y cells) and maturation (mouse cortical neurons) stages, and subcellular compartments in mouse (synaptoneurosomal fraction, cytoplasmic fraction, whole brain lysate). ..

Microglia dysregulation is thought to be causal for a group of neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases, called 'microgliopathies'. However, how the intracellular stimulation machinery in microglia is controlled is poorly understood. By using expression studies, we identified the ubiquitin-specific protease (Usp) 18 in white matter microglia that essentially contributes to microglial quiescence under homeostatic conditions. We further found that microglial Usp18 negatively regulated the activation of STAT1 and concomitant induction of interferon-induced genes thereby disabling the termination of IFN signalling. Unexpectedly, the Usp18-mediated feedback loop was independent from the catalytic domain of the protease but instead required the interacting region of Ifnar2. Additionally, the absence of Ifnar1 completely rescued microglial activation indicating a tonic IFN signal mediated by receptor interactions under non-diseased conditions. Finally, conditional depletion of Usp18 only in myeloid cells significantly enhanced the disease burden in a mouse model of CNS autoimmunity, increased axonal and myelin damage and determined the spatial distributions of CNS lesions that shared the same STAT1 signature as myeloid cells found in active multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. These results identify Usp18 as novel negative regulator of microglia activation, demonstrate a protective role of the IFNAR pathway for microglia and establish Usp18 as potential therapeutic target for the treatment of MS.

Despite decades of research, it remains unclear how MeCP2 actually regulates transcription or why RTT features appear only 6-18 months after birth. We examined MeCP2 binding to methylated cytosine in the CH context (mCH, where H = A, C, or T) in the adult mouse brain and found that MeCP2 binds these mCH sites, influencing nucleosome positioning and transcription. Strikingly, this pattern is unique to the mature nervous system, as it requires the increase in mCH after birth to reveal differences in MeCP2 binding to mCG, mCH, and non-methylated DNA elements. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism governing MeCP2 targeting and how this targeting might contribute to the delayed onset of RTT symptoms. mRNA-Seq were conducted from 7-week-old hypothalamus from MeCP2 knockout mice and their age and genetic background matched wild types control mice.

In order to assess the potential transmission of the sncRNAs through the mature spermatozoa during fertilization, the sncRNA population detected in male germ cells was also compared with sncRNAs detected in unfertilized mouse oocytes and zygotes. Combining the data obtained by NGS and microarrays from whole PGC and spermatogonia transcriptome, we defined the potential regulatory roles of specific miRNAs and their validated targets. Similar to miRNAs, both the small RNAs derived from snoRNAs and the piRNAs, could be involved in the postranscriptional regulation of mRNA transcripts during the male germ development. Finally, our results strongly suggest that the small RNAs-derived from tRNAs and rRNAs are interacting with PIWI proteins, and specifically with MILI. These new classes of piRNAs are not generated by the ping-pong pathway and could be the source of primary piRNAs. mRNA analysis of Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs), Spermatogonia cells (SPG), adult testis (AdT) and Gonad-less (GL) embryos.

The PGCs were purified from the cell suspension by immunopurification using anti-CD15 (anti-SSEA-1 in mouse) magnetic beads and the purity of the cells was validated by alkaline phosphatase staining. The SPGs were purified from the cell suspension by performing a short cell culture discrimination procedure (3-4 hours) that promotes the sedimentation and adhesion of somatic cells. Accordingly, the SPGs suspended in the supernatant can be readily recovered. The purity of the SPGs was validated by the presence of Stra8 (germline-specific gene) and the absence of Fn1 (soma-specific gene). For comparative purposes, total RNA from both: whole adult testis, as source of tissue expressing all male germ cells, and 13.5 dpc embryos, that were depleted of their gonads before to RNA isolation (?gonad-less? embryos);

One of the most striking properties of astrocyte endfeet is their enrichment in gap junction protein Connexin 43 and 30 (Cx43 and Cx30) allowing in particular for direct intercellular trafficking of ions and small signaling molecules through perivascular astroglial networks. In this study, we addressed the specific role of Cx30 at the gliovascular interface. Using an inactivation mouse model for Cx30 (Cx30  /  ), we showed that absence of Cx30 does not affect blood-brain barrier (BBB) organization and permeability. However, it results in the cerebrovascular fraction, in a strong upregulation of Sgcg encoding g-Sarcoglycan (SG), a member of the Dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) connecting cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. The same molecular event occurs in Cx30T5M/T5M mutated mice, where Cx30 channels are closed, demonstrating that Sgcg regulation relied on Cx30 channel functions. We further characterized the cerebrovascular Sarcoglycan complex (SGC) and showed the presence of alpha-, beta-, delta-, gamma-, epsilon-, and zeta- SG, as well as Sarcospan. Altogether, our results suggest that the Sarcoglycan complex is present in the cerebrovascular system, and that expression of one of its members, g-Sarcoglycan, depends on Cx30 channels. As described in skeletal muscles, the SGC may contribute to membrane stabilization and signal transduction in the cerebrovascular system, which may therefore be regulated by Cx30 channel-mediated functions.

To identify escape gene in vivo and to explore molecular mechanisms that regulate this process we analyzed the allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed XCI and distinguishable alleles based on single nucleotide polymorphisms. Using a new method to estimate allelic expression, we demonstrate a continuum between complete silencing and significant expression from the inactive X (Xi). Few genes (2-3%) escape XCI to a significant level and only a minority differs between mouse tissues, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. Allelic profiles of DNase I hypersensitivity and RNA polymerase II occupancy of genes on the Xi correlate with escape from XCI. Allelic binding profiles of the DNA binding protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in different cell types indicate that CTCF binding at the promoter correlates with escape. Importantly, CTCF binding at the boundary between escape and silenced domains may prevent the spreading of active escape chromatin into silenced domains.

The A  PP antisense treatment reversed learning and memory deficits and altered the expression of 944 hippocampal genes, which are involved in a coordinated set of signaling pathways.  Expression and pathway findings were verified at the protein and functional (phosphorylation) levels. Global differential profiling of hippocampal gene expression (12 month old adult mice:  Control, SAMP8, SAMP8 + Random antisense, SAMP8 + A  PP antisense) was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip   Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.  The A  PP antisense reversed the memory deficits and altered expression of 944 hippocampal genes. Pathway analysis showed significant gene expression changes in 9 pathways. These include the MAPK signaling pathway (P = 0.0078) and the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway (P = 0.043), which we have previously shown to be altered in SAMP8 mice. The changes in these pathways contributed to significant changes in the Neurotropin (P = 0.0083) and Insulin Signaling (P = 0.015) pathways, which are known to be important in learning and memory.  Changes in these pathways were accompanied by phosphorylation changes in the downstream target proteins p70S6K, GSK3  , ERK, and CREB.  These changes in hippocampal gene expression and protein phosphorylation may suggest specific new targets for antisense therapy aimed at improving memory. One-way ANOVA (4 conditions, n=4).

Embryonic piRNAs consist of both primary and secondary species and are mainly directed toward transposons. In meiotic cells, however, the piRNA population is transposon-poor and restricted to primary piRNAs derived from pachytene piRNA clusters. The mechanism controlling which piRNAs are present at each developmental stage is poorly understood. Here we show that RNF17 shapes adult meiotic piRNA content by suppressing the production of secondary piRNAs. In the absence of RNF17, ping-pong (secondary amplification) occurs inappropriately in meiotic cells, aberrantly targeting protein-coding genes and lncRNAs. Our data indicate that RNF17 comprises one component of a "refereeing" mechanism that prevents deleterious activity of the meiotic piRNA pathway by ensuring the selective loading of PIWI proteins with products of meiotic piRNA clusters.

Here we show that MORC1 is responsible for transposon repression in the male germline in a pattern that is similar to that observed for germ cells deficient for the DNA methyltransferase homolog DNMT3L. Morc1 mutants show highly localized defects in the establishment of DNA methylation at specific classes of transposons, and this is associated with failed transposon silencing at these sites.  Our results identify MORC1 as an important new regulator of the epigenetic landscape of male germ cells during the period of global de novo methylation.

However, their unique roles in the regulation of thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in specific cell types have not been determined. To accomplish this we generated a mouse model that lacked function of either NCoR1 or SMRT or both in the liver only.  Despite both corepressors being present in the liver, SMRT had no ability to regulate TH signaling when deleted in either euthyroid or hypothyroid animals. In contrast, disruption of NCoR1 action confirmed that it is the principal mediator of TH sensitivity in vivo. While SMRT played little role in TH signaling alone, when disrupted in combination with NCoR1 it greatly accentuated the activation of hepatic lipogenesis regulated by NCoR1.  Thus, corepressor specificity exists in vivo and NCoR1 is the principal regulator of TH action in the liver. However, both NCoR1 and SMRT collaborate to control hepatic lipogenesis and lipid storage, which likely reflects their cooperative activity in regulating the action of multiple NRs including the thyroid hormone receptor (TR).

We have previously shown that loss-of-function mutations of the mitochondrial protein kinase PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) cause the recessive PARK6 variant of PD. Now we generated a PINK1 deficient mouse and observed several novel phenotypes: A progressive reduction of weight and of locomotor activity selectively for spontaneous movements occurred at old age. As in PD, abnormal dopamine levels in the aged nigrostriatal projection accompanied the reduced movements. Possibly in line with the PARK6 syndrome but in contrast to sporadic PD, a reduced lifespan, dysfunction of brainstem and sympathetic nerves, visible aggregates of alpha-synuclein within Lewy bodies or nigrostriatal neurodegeneration were not present in aged PINK1-deficient mice. However, we demonstrate PINK1 mutant mice to exhibit a progressive reduction in mitochondrial preprotein import correlating with defects of core mitochondrial functions like ATP-generation and respiration. In contrast to the strong effect of PINK1 on mitochondrial dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster and in spite of reduced expression of fission factor Mtp18, we show reduced fission and increased aggregation of mitochondria only under stress in PINK1-deficient mouse neurons. Thus, aging Pink1-/- mice show increasing mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in impaired neural activity similar to PD, in absence of overt neuronal death. Transcriptome microarray data of Pink1-/- mouse brains in absence of a stressor, even at old age, show remarkably sparse dysregulations. See Gispert-S et al 2009 PLOS ONE.

The RNA-binding protein ATXN2 interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1, localizing to ribosomes at the rough endoplasmic reticulum or to polysomes. Under cell stress ATXN2 and PABPC1 show redistribution to stress granules where mRNAs are kept away from translation and from degradation. It is unknown whether ATXN2 associates preferentially with specific mRNAs or how it modulates their processing. Here, we investigated Atxn2 knock-out (Atxn2-/-) mouse liver, cerebellum and midbrain regarding their RNA profile, employing oligonucleotide microarrays for screening and RNA deep sequencing for validation. Modest ~1.4-fold upregulations were observed for the level of many mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other translation pathway factors. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and immunoblots in liver tissue confirmed these effects and demonstrated an inverse correlation also with PABPC1 mRNA and protein. ATXN2 deficiency also enhanced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, while impairing the global protein synthesis rate, suggesting a block between the enhanced translation drive and the impaired execution. Furthermore, ATXN2 overexpression and deficiency retarded cell cycle progression. ATXN2 mRNA levels showed a delayed phasic twofold increase under amino acid and serum starvation, similar to ATXN3, but different from motor neuron disease genes MAPT and SQSTM1. ATXN2 mRNA levels depended particularly on mTOR signalling. Altogether the data implicate ATXN2 in the adaptation of mRNA translation and cell growth to nutrient availability and stress.

Additionally, it has been reported that tamoxifen may cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans and experimental animals. The goals of the present study were to (i) investigate the mechanisms of the resistance of mice to tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and (ii) clarify effects of tamoxifen on NAFLD-associated liver injury. Feeding female WSB/EiJ mice a 420 p.p.m. tamoxifen-containing diet for 12 weeks resulted in an accumulation of tamoxifen-DNA adducts, (E)-alpha-(deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-tamoxifen (dG-TAM) and (E)-alpha-(deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-N-desmethyltamoxifen (dG-DesMeTAM), in the livers. The levels of hepatic dG-TAM and dG-DesMeTAM DNA adducts in tamoxifen-treated mice were 578 and 340 adducts/108 nucleotides, respectively, while the extent of global DNA and repetitive elements methylation and histone modifications did not differ from the values in control mice. Additionally, there was no biochemical or histopathological evidence of NAFLD-associated liver injury in mice treated with tamoxifen. A transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes demonstrated that tamoxifen caused predominantly down-regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism genes accompanied by a distinct over-expression of the lipocalin 13 (Lcn13) and peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (Pparg), which may prevent the development of NAFLD. The results of the present study demonstrate that the resistance of mice to tamoxifen-induced liver carcinogenesis may be associated with its ability to induce genotoxic alterations only without affecting the cellular epigenome and an inability of tamoxifen to induce the development of NAFLD. Female and male WSB/EiJ mice were fed diet containing 420 p.p.m. tamoxifen for 12 weeks, and then tamoxifen-DNA adduct formation and gene expression profiles in the livers from four control and four tamoxifen-treated mice were investigated. .. 18 weeks;  Female;  Male;  total RNA;  Female, liver, control, replicate 1;  Female, liver, control, replicate 2;  Female, liver, control, replicate 3;  Female, liver, control, replicate 4;  Female, liver, tamoxifen, 420ppm, 12weeks, replicate 1;  Female, liver, tamoxifen, 420ppm, 12weeks, replicate 2;  Female, liver, tamoxifen, 420ppm, 12weeks, replicate 3;  Female, liver, tamoxifen, 420ppm, 12weeks, replicate 4;  Male, liver, control, replicate 1;  Male, liver, control, replicate 2;  Male, liver, control, replicate 3;  Male, liver, control, replicate 4;  Male, liver, tamoxifen, 420ppm, 12weeks, replicate 1;  Male, liver, tamoxifen, 420ppm, 12weeks, replicate 2;  Male, liver, tamoxifen, 420ppm, 12weeks, replicate 3;  Male, liver, tamoxifen, 420ppm, 12weeks, replicate 4;  WSB/EiJ;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  Mice were allocated randomly to receive either NIH-31 diet containing 420 p.p.m. tamoxifen (Dyets, Bethlehem, PA) or control NIH-31 diet.

This A to I editing is widespread and required for normal life and development. Besides mRNAs and repetitive elements, ADARs can target miRNA precursors. Editing of miRNA precursors can affect processing efficiency and alter target specificity. Interestingly, ADARs can also influence miRNA abundance independent of RNA-editing. In mouse embryos where editing levels are low, ADAR2 was found to be the major ADAR protein that affects miRNA abundance. Here we extend our analysis to adult mouse brains where high editing levels are observed. Results: Using Illumina deep sequencing we compare the abundances of mature miRNAs and editing events within them, between wild-type and ADAR2 knockout mice in the adult mouse brain. Reproducible changes in abundance of specific miRNAs are observed in ADAR2 deficient mice. Most of these quantitative changes seem unrelated to A to I editing events. However, many A to G transitions in cDNAs prepared from mature miRNA sequences, reflecting A to I editing events in the RNA, are observed with frequencies reaching up to 80%. About half of these editing events are primarily caused by ADAR2 while a few miRNAs show increased editing in the absence of ADAR2, suggesting preferential editing by ADAR1. Moreover, novel, previously unknown editing events were identified in several miRNAs. In general 64% of all editing events are located within the seed region of mature miRNAs. In one of these cases retargeting of the edited miRNA could be verified in reporter assays. Also, altered processing efficiency upon editing near a processing site could be experimentally verified. Conclusions: ADAR2 can significantly influence the abundance of certain miRNAs in the brain. Only in a few cases changes in miRNA abundance can be explained by miRNA editing. Thus, ADAR2 binding to miRNA precursors, without editing them, may influence their processing and thereby abundance. ADAR1 and ADAR2 have both overlapping and distinct specificities for editing of miRNA editing sites. Over 60% of editing occurs in the seed region possibly changing target specificities for many edited miRNAs.

In an effort to establish the identity of the tissue specific clock that is responsible for this infertility, we used the steroidogenic factor-1 (Sf1) promoter to drive Cre-mediated recombination and genetically delete Bmal1 within cells of the reproductive axis. We show that Bmal1 within the reproductive axis of females is essential for normal fertility through its role in maintaining implantation, but is not required for normal estrous cycling. At the root of this biology appears to be a defect in the ovaries, including regulation of ovarian lipid biosynthetic or metabolic processes  and their roles in maintaining progesterone synthesis.  This conclusion is based upon three observations.  First, that deletion of Bmal1 within the reproductive axis reduces/leads to affected transcripts in steroidogenic pathways for the LH receptor and lowers progesterone levels.  Second, that progesterone supplementation of these conditional mutants rescues implantation. Third, transplantation of wild type ovaries into Bmal1 reproductive axis mutants rescues fertility.  Our study demonstrates the significance of ovarian Bmal1 as an overriding influence in experimental models of infertility.

We found 43% of all protein coding genes showed circadian rhythms in transcription somewhere in the body, largely in an organ-specific manner. In most organs, we noticed the expression of many oscillating genes peaked during transcriptional "rush hours" preceding dawn and dusk. Looking at the genomic landscape of rhythmic genes, we saw that they clustered together, were longer, and had more splice forms than nonoscillating genes. Systems-level analysis revealed intricate rhythmic orchestration of gene pathways throughout the body. We also found oscillations in the expression of more than 1,000 known and novel noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Supporting their potential role in mediating clock function, ncRNAs conserved between mouse and human showed rhythmic expression in similar proportions as protein coding genes. Importantly, we also found that the majority of best-selling drugs and World Health Organization essential medicines directly target the products of rhythmic genes. Many of these drugs have short half-lives and may benefit from timed dosage.

Surprisingly, potent selective antagonists of Nav1.7 are weak analgesics. We therefore investigated whether Nav1.7 , as well as contributing to electrical signalling  may have  an additional function. Here we report  that Nav1.7 deletion has profound effects on the sensory neuron transcriptome, leading to dysregulation  of a number of transcription factors  as well as upregulation of enkephalin precursor PENK mRNA and down regulation of CEACAM10 mRNA, a protein involved in noxious thermosensation. PENK mRNA is transcriptionally upregulated in Nav1.7 null mutant female sensory neurons, resulting in increased enkephalin expression  in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. PENK expression is down-regulated  by addition of the sodium ionophore monensin, suggesting that sodium may play a role as a second messenger. Application of the opioid antagonist naloxone strongly enhances noxious peripheral input into the spinal cord,   and dramatically reduces analgesia in both male and female Nav1.7 null mutant mice, as well as in human Nav1.7 null mutants. These data show that loss of Nav1.7 expression increases opioid drive over the lifetime of  mice and humans. They further suggest that  Nav1.7 channel blockers alone may not replicate the phenotype of null mutant humans and mice, but should be potentiated with exogenous opioids.

Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to the mouse genome (build mm9) and identified 16,014 transcripts in the retinas of WT and Nrl-/- mice with BWA workflow and 34,115 transcripts with TopHat workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed stable expression of 25 known housekeeping genes, and 12 of these were validated with qRT-PCR. RNA-seq data had a linear relationship with qRT-PCR for more than four orders of magnitude and a goodness of fit (R2) of 0.8798. Approximately 10% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and Nrl-/-  retina, with a fold change >=1.5 and p value <0.05. Altered expression of 25 genes was confirmed with qRT-PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes uncovered several as yet uncharacterized genes that may contribute to retinal function. Data analysis with BWA and TopHat workflows revealed a significant overlap yet provided complementary insights in transcriptome profiling.

It is known that regulation of gene expression by microRNAs is a key event in muscle development and disease. To understand genome-wide changes in microRNAs and mRNAs during muscle aging, we sequenced microRNAs as well as mRNAs from mouse gastrocnemius muscles at two different ages (6 versus 24-month-old). Thirty-four microRNAs (15 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated) were differentially expressed with age among which were microRNAs such as miR-206 or -434 which were differentially expressed in aged muscle in previous studies. Interestingly, seven microRNAs in a microRNA cluster at imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 locus on chromosome 12 were coordinately down-regulated. In addition, sixteen novel microRNAs were identified. Integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression revealed that microRNAs contribute to muscle aging possibly through the positive regulation of transcription, metabolic process, and kinase activity. Many of the age-related microRNAs were implicated in human muscular diseases. We suggest that genome-wide microRNA profiling helps to expand our knowledge of microRNA function in the muscle aging process. miRNA profiles of gastrocnemius muscle tissues (n=10) were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq-2000 .. 24 months (aged);  6 months (young);  total RNA;  small RNA;  aged_gastrocnemius muscle;  young_gastrocnemius muscle;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  gastrocnemius muscle;

We recently determined that Axin2 and Runx2 molecularly interact in differentiating osteoblasts to regulate intramembranous bone formation, but the relationship between these factors in endochondral bone formation was unresolved. To address this, we examined the effects of Axin2 deficiency on the cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) phenotype of Runx2+/- mice, focusing on skeletal defects attributed to improper endochondral bone formation. Axin2 deficiency unexpectedly exacerbated calvarial components of the CCD phenotype in the Runx2+/- mice; the endocranial layer of the frontal suture, which develops by endochondral bone formation, failed to mineralize in the Axin2-/-:Runx2+/-mice, resulting in a cartilaginous, fibrotic and larger fontanel than observed in Runx2+/- mice. Transcripts associated with cartilage development (e.g., Acan, miR140) were expressed at higher levels, whereas blood vessel morphogenesis transcripts (e.g., Slit2) were suppressed in Axin2-/-:Runx2+/-calvaria. Cartilage maturation was impaired, as primary chondrocytes from double mutant mice demonstrated delayed differentiation and produced less calcified matrix in vitro. The genetic dominance of Runx2 was also reflected during endochondral fracture repair, as both Runx2+/- and double mutant Axin2-/-:Runx2+/- mice had enlarged fracture calluses at early stages of healing. However, by the end stages of fracture healing, double mutant animals diverged from the Runx2+/- mice, showing smaller calluses and increased torsional strength indicative of more rapid end stage bone formation as seen in the Axin2-/- mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate a dominant role for Runx2 in chondrocyte maturation, but implicate Axin2 as an important modulator of the terminal stages of endochondral bone formation. 4 mice per genotype X 4 genotypes: wildtype (WT), Runx2+/- (R-Het), Axin2-/- (A-KO), Axin2-/-:Runx2+/- (A-KO:R-Het).

Despite widespread clinical use of mTOR inhibitors, the role of mTORC1 in renal tubular function and kidney homeostasis remains elusive. By utilizing constitutive and inducible deletion of conditional Raptor alleles in renal tubular epithelial cells, we discovered that mTORC1 deficiency caused a marked concentrating defect, loss of tubular cells and slowly progressive renal fibrosis. Transcriptional profiling revealed that mTORC1 maintains renal tubular homeostasis by controlling mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis as well as transcellular transport processes involved in counter-current multiplication and urine concentration. Although mTORC2 partially compensated the loss of mTORC1, exposure to ischemia and reperfusion injury exaggerated the tubular damage in mTORC1-deficient mice, and caused pronounced apoptosis, diminished proliferation rates and delayed recovery. These findings identify mTORC1 as an essential regulator of tubular energy metabolism and as a crucial component of ischemic stress responses. Pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 likely affects tubular homeostasis, and may be particularly deleterious if the kidney is exposed to acute injury. Furthermore, the combined inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 may increase the susceptibility to renal damage.

Brain and retinal vascular defects caused by loss of Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling can be fully rescued by stabilizing beta-catenin, and loss of beta-catenin's transcriptional activation domain or expression of a dominant negative Tcf4 recapitulates the vascular development and barrier defects seen with loss of receptor, co-receptor, or ligand, indicating that Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling acts predominantly by beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional regulation. This work strongly supports a model in which identical or nearly identical canonical Wnt signaling mechanisms mediate neural tube and retinal vascularization and maintain the BBB and BRB.

The lens has a particularly biased transcriptome, with the top 50 genes encoding approximately 90% of the protein content.  Using RNA-Seq, we have shown that there are over 7,700 genes being expressed in the lens at embryonic day 15.5.  As expected, the crystallins and many structural genes were amoung the most highly expressed; however, numerous genes expressed at lower transcript abundance were also identified.  This study provides a framework for the application of RNA-Seq technology towards characterization of the mammalian lens transcriptome during development. Using high-throughput RNA-sequencing, gene expression in the mammalian lens was compared between an inbred C56Bl/6<har> strain and a mix background strain at E15.5.  This analysis identifies almost 2,000 genes being differentially expressed between the inbred and mixed background lenses, ranging from 6.5 fold upregulated to 5.2 fold downregulated in the mixed background compared to the inbred strain.  This list does not include unknown/predicted genes or pseudogenes which are known to change between strains.  Further, it appears that approximately 98% of these genes are altered at levels less than 2.5 fold.  This study therefore provides a fold change threshold cutoff (2.5 fold) to use in the analysis of differentially expressed lens genes at E15.5 using RNA-Seq technology as it takes into account genetic variation due to background strain differences. SIP1 encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates multiple developmental processes as highlighted by the pleiotropic defects observed in Mowat-Wilson Syndrome, which results from mutations in this gene.  Further, in adults, dysregulated SIP1 expression has been implicated in both cancer and fibrotic diseases where it functionally links TGFb signaling to the loss of epithelial preferred gene expression.  In the ocular lens, an epithelial tissue important for vision, Sip1 is co-expressed with epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, and is required for the complete separation of the lens vesicle from the head ectoderm during early ocular morphogenesis.  However, the function of Sip1 after early lens morphogenesis is still unknown.   Here, we conditionally deleted Sip1 from the developing mouse lens shortly after lens vesicle closure, leading to defects in coordinated fiber cell tip migration, defective suture formation and cataract.  Interestingly, RNA-Sequencing analysis on Sip1 knockout lenses identified 190 differentially expressed genes, all of which are distinct from previously described Sip1 target genes involved in EMT/cancer.  Furthermore, 34% of the upregulated genes in the Sip1 knockout lenses are normally downregulated as the lens transitions from the lens vesicle to early lens, while 49% of the genes downregulated in the Sip1 knockout lenses are normally upregulated during early lens development.  Overall, these data imply that Sip1 plays a major role in reprogramming the lens vesicle away from a surface ectoderm cell fate towards that necessary for the development of a transparent lens and demonstrate that Sip1 regulates distinctly different sets of genes in different cellular contexts.

Doublecortin (DCX), LIS1 and alpha1-tubulin (TUBA1A), are mutated in these disorders, however corresponding mouse mutants do not show heterotopic neurons in the neocortex. On the other hand, the spontaneously arisen HeCo mouse mutant displays this phenotype. The study of this model reveals novel mechanisms of heterotopia formation. While, HeCo neurons migrate at the same speed as WT,  abnormally distributed dividing progenitors were found throughout the cortical wall from E13. Through genetic studies we identified Eml1 as the mutant gene in HeCo mice. No full length transcripts of Eml1 were identified due to a retrotransposon insertion in an intron. Re-expression of Eml1, coding for a microtubule-associated protein, rescues the HeCo progenitor phenotype. We further show that EML1 is mutated in giant ribbon-like heterotopia in human.

Recently, a set of small RNAs known as rasRNAs (repeat-associated small RNAs) have been related to the down-regulation of TEs conferring a means to safeguard genome integrity. Two key members of the rasRNAs group are piRNAs and endo-siRNAs. In this study, we have performed a comparative analysis of piRNAs and endo-siRNAs present in mouse oocytes, spermatozoa and zygotes, identified by deep sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Both piRNAs and endo-siRNAs regulate TEs in addition to other repetitive elements such as tRNAs and rRNAs, suggesting an alternative role of rasRNAs with regard to translation regulation. The detection of piRNAs and endo-siRNAs in sperm cells and revealed also in zygotes, hints to their potential delivery to oocytes during fertilization. However, a comparative assessment of the three cell types indicates that both piRNAs and endo-siRNAs are mainly maternally inherited. Finally, we have assessed the role of the different rasRNA molecules in connection with amplification processes by way of the "ping-pong cycle." Our results suggest that the ping-pong cycle can act on other rasRNAs, such as tRNA- and rRNA-derived fragments, thus not only being restricted to TEs during gametogenesis, as was evidenced in spermatozoa, oocytes and zygotes.

We measured genome-wide testis expression in 305 male F2s from a cross between wild-derived inbred strains of M. musculus musculus and M. m. domesticus. We identified several thousand cis- and trans-acting QTL contributing to expression variation (eQTL). Many trans eQTL cluster into eleven "hotspots," seven of which co-localize with QTL for sterility phenotypes identified in the cross. The number and clustering of trans eQTL  - but not cis eQTL - were substantially lower when mapping was restricted to a "fertile" subset of mice, providing evidence that trans eQTL hotspots are related to sterility. Functional annotation of transcripts with eQTL provides insights into the biological processes disrupted by sterility loci and guides prioritization of candidate genes. Using a conditional mapping approach, we identified eQTL dependent on interactions between loci, revealing a complex system of epistasis.

At present, there is no effective therapy for organ fibrosis. Previous studies demonstrated that aged plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1) knockout mice develop spontaneously cardiac-selective fibrosis without affecting any other organs including kidney. Therefore, the PAI-1 knockout model of cardiac fibrosis provides an excellent opportunity to find the igniter(s) of cardiac fibrosis and its status in unaffected organs. We hypothesized that differential expressions of profibrotic and antifibrotic genes in PAI-1 knockout hearts and unaffected organs lead to cardiac selective fibrosis. In order to address this prediction, we have used a genome-wide gene expression profiling of transcripts derived from aged PAI-1 knockout hearts and kidneys. The variations of global gene expression profiling were compared within four groups: wildtype heart vs. knockout heart; wildtype kidney vs. knockout kidney; knockout heart vs. knockout kidney and wildtype heart vs. wildtype kidney. Analysis of illumina-based microarray data revealed that several genes involved in different biological processes such as immune system processing, response to stress, cytokine signaling, cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, matrix organization and transcriptional regulation were affected in hearts and kidneys by the absence of PAI-1, a potent inhibitor of urokinase- and tissue-type plasminogen activator. Importantly, the expressions of a number of genes, involved in profibrotic pathways were upregulated or downregulated in PAI-1 knockout hearts compared to wildtype hearts and PAI-1 knockout kidneys. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report on the influence of PAI-1 on global gene expression profiling in the heart and kidney and its implication in several biological processes including fibrogenesis. Total RNA was extracted from hearts and kidneys derived from three PAI-1 knockout (12- month old) and three wild-type mice (12-month old) using RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of RNA (RNA Integrity, RIN) in all 12 samples (3 wildtype hearts; 3 PAI-1 KO hearts; 3 wildtype kidneys; and 3 PAI-1 KO kidneys) was checked using the bioanalyzer. We have used a genome-wide gene expression profiling of transcripts derived from aged PAI-1 knockout hearts and kidneys. The variations of global gene expression profiling were compared within four groups: wildtype heart vs. knockout heart; wildtype kidney vs. knockout kidney; knockout heart vs. knockout kidney and wildtype heart vs. wildtype kidney. .. 12 months;  PAI-1 KO;  wildtype;  total RNA;  12 m old PAI-1 knockout mouse Kidney;  12 m old PAI-1 knockout mouse heart;  12 m old Wildtype mouse Kidney;  12 m old Wildtype mouse heart;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Heart;  Kidney;  All heart and kidney tissue samples were collected from 12 months old wild type and PAI-1 knockout mice.

We classified 80 cells comprising the distal lung epithelium at E18.5 into distinct populations using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or prior purification of cell types.  This "reverse tissue engineering" approach confirmed the basic outlines of the conventional model of cell type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of a large number of novel transcriptional regulators and cell type markers that discriminate between the different populations. Moreover, we reconstructed the steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors into both alveolar lineages based on the presence of undifferentiated, differentiated as well as differentiation intermediate cells at the single time point E18.5. Finally, we followed Sftpc-positive cells throughout their lifecycle (E14.5, E16.5, E18.5, adult) and identified 7 gene sets that differentiate between the multipotential, bipotential, mature, as well as intermediate states of the AT2 lineage. 198 single-cell transcriptomes from mouse lung epithelium were analyzed in total, two 200-cell bulk control samples as well as one no-cell control; All single cell and control samples contain 92 external RNA spike-ins; For time point E18.5, three individual experiments were performed using 3 different pregnant mice (3 biological replicates): Replicate 1 (pooled sibling lungs) yielded 20 single cell transcriptomes, replicate 2 (one single embryonic lung) yielded 34 single cell transcriptomes and replicate 3 (pooled siibling lungs) yielded 26 single cell transcriptomes; In addition, a 200-cell bulk control sample was prepared for E18.5 replicate 1 and E18.5 replicate 3 experiments; A no-cell control sample was generated for the E18.5 replicate 1 experiment; For time point E14.5, one experiment (one pregnant mouse, pooled sibling lungs) was performed yielding 45 single cell transcriptomes; For time point E16.5, one experiment (one pregnant mouse, pooled sibling lungs) was performed yielding 27 single cell transcriptomes; For the adult time point, one 107 day old mouse was used and transcriptomes of 46 single cells were obtained; All single cell samples were processed on the microfluidic platform, 200-cell-bulk and no-cell control samples were processed in microliter volumes in PCR tubes. ..

Pregnant and non-pregnant adult mice were euthanized by CO2 administration. For embryonic samples (E14.5, 16.5, and 18.5), embryonic lungs were isolated and either a single embryonic lung was used or 5-7 sibling lungs were pooled. For the adult experiment, the pulmonary vasculature was cleared and lungs were gently inflated with digestion buffer prior to isolation and mincing of the lung. All tissue was digested at 37C for 45 min using Elastase and DNase I, triturated and subsequently filtered using 100?m and 40?m strainers to obrtain a single cell suspension. Embryonic lung epithelial cells were purified by magnetic-assisted cell sorting using CD45 depletion followed by EpCAM enrichment. Transgenically labeled adult AT2 cells were purified by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting.;

To help elucidate the genetic networks underlying mammalian brain patterning we conducted detailed transcriptional profiling during embryonic development of the mouse brain. 2400 genes were identified as showing differential expression between three developmental stages. Analysis of the data identified nine gene clusters to demonstrate analogous expression profiles. A significant group of novel genes of as yet undiscovered biological function were detected, as being potentially relevant to brain development and function, in addition to genes that have previously identified roles in the brain. Analysis of left-right asymmetry of expression revealed 35 genes as putatively asymmetric from a combined data set. Our data constitutes a valuable new resource for neuroscience and neuro-development, exposing possible functional associations between genes, including novel loci, and encouraging their further investigation in human neurological and behavioural disorders.

Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1) sequesters Nrf2 in the cytosol. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of Nrf2 in regulating the mRNA of genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes and xenobiotic transporters. Microarray analysis was performed in livers of Nrf2-null, wild-type, Keap1-knockdown mice with increased Nrf2 activation, and Keap1-hepatocyte knockout mice with maximum Nrf2 activation. In general, Nrf2 did not have a marked effect on uptake transporters, but the mRNAs of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a1, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, and organic anion transporter 2 were decreased with Nrf2 activation. The effect of Nrf2 on cytochrome P450 (Cyp) genes was minimal, with only Cyp2a5, Cyp2c50, Cyp2c54, and Cyp2g1 increased, and Cyp2u1 decreased with enhanced Nrf2 activation. However, Nrf2 increased mRNA of many other phase-I enzymes, such as aldo-keto reductases, carbonyl reductases, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1. Many genes involved in phase-II drug metabolism were induced by Nrf2, including glutathione S -transferases, UDP- glucuronosyltransferases, and UDP-glucuronic acid synthesis enzymes. Efflux transporters, such as multidrug resistance-associated proteins, breast cancer resistant protein, as well as ATP-binding cassette g5 and g8 were induced by Nrf2. In conclusion, Nrf2 markedly alters hepatic mRNA of a large number of drug metabolizing enzymes and xenobiotic transporters, and thus Nrf2 plays a central role in xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression in response to Nrf2 activation and identified distinct classes of up- and down-regulated genes. process.

Hdacs control inflammation, as shown by Hdac inhibitor-dependent protection from DSS-induced murine colitis. While tissue-specific Hdac knockouts show redundant and specific functions, little is known of their intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) role. We have shown previously that dual Hdac1/Hdac2 IEC-specific loss disrupts cell proliferation and determination, with decreased secretory cell numbers and altered barrier function. We thus investigated how compound Hdac1/Hdac2 or Hdac2 IEC-specific deficiency alters the inflammatory response. Floxed Hdac1 and Hdac2 and villin-Cre mice were interbred. Compound Hdac1/Hdac2 IEC-deficient mice showed chronic basal inflammation, with increased basal Disease Activity Index (DAI) and deregulated Reg gene colonic expression. DSS-treated dual Hdac1/Hdac2 IEC-deficient mice displayed increased DAI, histological score, intestinal permeability and inflammatory gene expression. In contrast to double knockouts, Hdac2 IEC-specific loss did not affect IEC determination and growth, nor result in chronic inflammation. However, Hdac2 disruption protected against DSS colitis, as shown by decreased DAI, intestinal permeability and caspase-3 cleavage. Hdac2 IEC-specific deficient mice displayed increased expression of IEC gene subsets, such as colonic antimicrobial Reg3b and Reg3g mRNAs, and decreased expression of immune cell function-related genes. Our data show that Hdac1 and Hdac2 are essential IEC homeostasis regulators. IEC-specific Hdac1 and Hdac2 may act as epigenetic sensors and transmitters of environmental cues and regulate IEC-mediated mucosal homeostatic and inflammatory responses. Different levels of IEC Hdac activity may lead to positive or negative outcomes on intestinal homeostasis during inflammation.

At early stages, immature olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) elongate their axons to penetrate the brain basement membrane, contact and form synapses with projection neurons of the olfactory bulb primordium. Axonal elongation is accompanied by migration of the GnRH+ neurons, followed by their ingression in the septo-hypothalamic area of the forebrain. This process is specifically impaired in the Kallmann's syndrome (KS), a disorder characterized by anosmia and central hypogonadism. A set of transcription factors are master regulators of olfactory connectivity and GnRH neuron migration.  We explored the transcriptional network underlying this  process, by profiling the OE and adjacent mesenchyme at distinct embryonic ages. We also profiled the OE from embryos null for Dlx5, a homeogene essential for olfactory development, that causes a KS-like phenotype when deleted. We also applied analysis of conserved co-expression to integrate the obtained data with information on KS disease genes. The prevalent categories of genes differentially expressed during development are neuronal differentiation, extracellular remodelling and cell adhesion. From the analysis of Dlx5 mutant tissues we identify about 120 genes with a prevalence of intermediate filaments, cell signalling, epithelial and neuronal differentiation. Filtering for true OE expression and for the presence of Dlx5 binding sites, yielded twenty genes, of the following categories: 1) transmembrane adhesion/receptor molecules, 2) axon-glia interaction molecules, 3) synaptic proteins, 4) scaffold/adapter for signalling molecules. To functionally analyze these genes in vivo, we used three zebrafish fluorescent reporter zebrafish strains, in which we monitored early phases of olfactory/GnRH development upon gene downmodulation. The depletion of three (of five) Dlx5 targets affected axonal extension and targeting, while two (of two) altered GnRH neuron position and neurite organization. In one experiment we compare the olfactory sensory epithelium from wild-type embryos, at three times of development, i.e. E11.5, E12.5 and E14.5.

The MEIS1 locus contains an exceptionally large number of highly conserved non-coding regions (HCNRs), which potentially function as cis-regulatory modules. We analyzed the HCNRs in the RLS-associated linkage disequilibrium (LD) block for allele-dependent enhancer activity in both zebrafish and mouse, comparing the protective and risk alleles of RLS-associated common variants. We found one enhancer, harboring the lead SNP rs12469063, which showed an allele-dependent reduction of reporter gene expression exclusively in the embryonic ganglionic eminences at developmental stage E12.5. Notably, the reporter activity overlapped with the endogenous telencephalic Meis1 expression domain, which co-localized with transcripts of all four validated RLS loci. Thus, the developing telencephalon represents the first neuroanatomic region implicated for RLS based on GWAS findings.

The Insulin/Insulin Growth Factor (Igf) signaling pathway is an established regulator of beta cell survival and is found downregulated in human T2D islets. The Insulin Receptor Substrate 2 (Irs2) plays a central role in the coordination of this pathway in beta cells. Thus, Irs2 knockout mice (Irs2 -/-) exhibit increased beta cell apoptosis that leads to a progressive decline of beta cell mass and hyperglycaemia. In this study, we sought to determine whether the anti-diabetic compound sodium tungstate could prevent the onset of diabetes in Irs2 -/- mice. Oral administration of tungstate resulted in an overall improvement in whole-body glucose tolerance in Irs2 -/- mice which correlated with increased beta cell mass. Enhanced beta cell mass was due to a dramatic reduction of beta cell apoptosis without changes in proliferation. Whole genome gene profiling analysis of islets isolated from treated Irs2 -/- mice confirmed a broad impact of tungstate on cell death pathways. Mechanistically, tungstate induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation in islets in vitro and, in agreement, treated Irs2 -/- islets exhibited increased basal Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Tungstate also downregulated expression of apoptosis-related genes in Irs2-/- islets in vitro, uncovering a direct effect of this compound in islets. All together, our data demonstrate that tungstate can restore beta cell mass and glucose homeostasis in a context of deficient Insulin/Igf signaling. This study underscores the importance of developing strategies specifically designed to arrest beta cell apoptosis as a means to prevent progressive beta cell failure in diabetes. 10-week old WT and Irs2 -/- mice were randomly divided into two treatment group, in a total of 4 experimental groups.

The evolutionary history of lncRNAs can provide insights into their functionality, but comparative analyses have been precluded by our ignorance of lncRNAs in non-model organisms. Here, we use RNA sequencing to identify lncRNAs in eleven tetrapod species and we present the first large-scale evolutionary study of lncRNA repertoires and expression patterns. We identify ~11,000 primate- specific lncRNA families, which show evidence for selective constraint during recent evolution, and ~2,400 highly conserved lncRNAs (including ~400 genes that likely originated more than 300 million years ago). We find that lncRNAs, in particular ancient ones, are generally actively regulated and may predominantly function in embryonic development. lncRNA X-inactivation patterns reveal an extremely female-biased monotreme-specific lncRNA, which may partially compensate X-dosage in this lineage. Most lncRNAs evolve rapidly in terms of sequence and expression levels, but global patterns like tissue specificities are often conserved. We compared expression patterns of homologous lncRNA and protein-coding families across tetrapods to reconstruct an evolutionarily conserved co-expression network. This network, which surprisingly contains many lncRNA hubs, suggests potential functions for lncRNAs in fundamental processes like spermatogenesis or synaptic transmission, but also in more specific mechanisms such as placenta growth suppression through miRNA production. [Batch 1 and 2] To broaden our understanding of lncRNA evolution, we used an extensive RNA-seq dataset to establish lncRNA repertoires and homologous gene families in 11 tetrapod species. We analyzed the poly-adenylated transcriptomes of 8 organs (cortex/whole brain without cerebellum, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, placenta, ovary and testis) and 11 species (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, mouse, opossum, platypus, chicken and the frog Xenopus tropicalis), which shared a common ancestor ~370 millions of years (MY) ago.

First, there is differentiation along the crypt-villus axis of the intestinal stem cells into absorptive enterocytes, Paneth, goblet, tuft, enteroendocrine or M-cells, which is mainly regulated by WNT. Second, there is specialization along the cephalocaudal axis with different absorptive and digestive functions in duodenum, jejunum and ileum that is controlled by several transcription factors such as GATA4. However, so far it is unknown whether location-specific functional properties are intrinsically programmed within stem cells or if continuous signalling from mesenchymal cells is necessary to maintain the location-specific identity of the small intestine.   By using the pure epithelial organoid technique, we show that region-specific gene expression profiles are conserved throughout long-term cultures of both mouse and human intestinal stem cells and correlated with differential Gata4 expression. Furthermore, the human organoid culture system demonstrates that Gata4-regulated gene expression is only allowed in absence of WNT signalling.   These data show that location-specific function is intrinsically programmed in the adult stem cells of the small intestine and that their differentiation fate is independent of location-specific extracellular signals.  In light of the potential future clinical application of small intestine-derived organoids, our data imply that it is important to generate GATA4-positive and GATA4-negative cultures to regenerate all essential functions of the small intestine.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligands and receptors are expressed in the pregnant uterus, and BMP2 has been shown to be a key regulator of implantation. In this study, we investigated the roles of the BMP type 1 receptor, activin-like kinase 2 (ALK2), during mouse pregnancy by producing uterine-specific Alk2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. In the absence of ALK2, embryos can invade the uterine epithelium and stroma, but stromal cells cannot undergo uterine decidualization, resulting in sterility. Mechanistically, microarray analysis revealed that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (Cebpb) expression is suppressed during decidualization in Alk2 cKO females. These findings and the similar phenotypes of Cebpb cKO and Alk2 cKO mice lead to the hypothesis that BMPs act upstream of C/EBPbeta to regulate decidualization. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down ALK2 in human uterine stromal cells (HESC) and discovered that ablation of ALK2 alters HESC decidualization and suppresses CEBPB mRNA and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of decidualizing HESC confirmed that BMP signaling protein, SMAD1, directly regulates expression of CEBPB by binding a distinct regulatory sequence in the CEBPB promoter; C/EBPbeta, in turn, regulates the expression of progesterone receptor (PGR). Our work clarifies the conserved mechanisms through which BMPs regulate embryo implantation in rodents and primates and, for the first time, uncovers a linear pathwayof BMP signaling through ALK2 to regulate CEBPB and, subsequently, PGR during decidualization. gene expression profiling of two groups: control mice and Alk2 cKO mice .. hybrid C57BL/6J and 129S5/SvEvBrd;  Alk2 cKO;  control;  total RNA;  A2CKO1;  A2CKO2;  A2CKO3;  A2CNT1;  A2CNT2;  A2CNT3;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Analysis of gene expression in tissues from genetically heterogeneous mouse or human populations can reveal motifs associated with the structural or functional components of the tissue, and may predict roles for genes of unknown function4,5. Here we have applied this network strategy to uncover a novel role for the Hipk2 gene in the transcriptional system controlling adipogenesis. Both in vitro and in vivo models were used to show that knockdown or loss of Hipk2 specifically inhibits white adipose cell differentiation and tissue development. In addition, loss of Hipk2 leads to induction of pockets of multilocular brown fat-like cells in remaining white adipose depots. These cells express markers of brown and beige fat such as uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) and transmembrane protein 26 (Tmem26), and thermogenic genes including PPAR-   coactivator 1a (Ppargc1a), and cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector a (Cidea). These changes are accompanied by increased insulin sensitivity in Hipk2 knock-out mice and reduced high fat diet-induced weight gain, highlighting a potential role for this kinase in diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Our study underscores the versatility and power of a readily available tissue, such as skin, for network modelling of systemic transcriptional programs involved in multiple pathways, including lipid metabolism and adipogenesis.

In an attempt to enhance and expand our understanding of neural tube closure, we undertook a high-throughput gene expression analysis of the neural tube as it was forming in the mouse embryo. Open and closed sections of the developing neural tube were micro-dissected from mouse embryos, and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse expression arrays. Clustering of genes differentially regulated in open and closed sections of the developing neural tube highlighted molecular processes previously recognized to be involved in neural tube closure and neurogenesis. Analysis of the genes in these categories identified potential candidates underlying neural tube closure. In addition, we identified approximately 25 novel genes, of unknown function, that were significantly up-regulated in the closed neural tube. Based on their expression patterns in the developing neural tube, five novel genes are proposed as interesting candidates for involvement in neurogenesis. The high-throughput expression analysis of the neural tube as it forms allows for better characterization of pathways involved in neural tube closure and neurogenesis, and hopefully will strengthen the foundation for further research along the pathways dictating neural tube development. Embryos were dissected at days E8.5 and E9.5, and the neuroepithelium/ neural tube were mechanically detached from underlying tissues, and then separated into two regions: 1)    open neuroepithelium   : neuroepithelial tissue caudal to the open/closed junction, and 2)    closed neural tube   , extending from a somite   s breadth rostral to the open/closed junction, up to the level of the fifth- or sixth-to-last somite. Samples consisted of biological triplicates of RNA extract from the above tissues (pooled by litter, and representing a total of 111 embryos): E8.5 open neuroepithelium, E8.5 closed neural tube, E9.5 open neuroepithelium, and E9.5 closed neural tube. Thus, a total of 12 samples (representing 111 embryos) were hybridized to the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).

Coordinated contraction of these two layers facilitates the movement of food down the digestive tract. Though abnormal ME function or development has been linked to pseudoobstruction and irritable bowel syndrome, little is known about the molecular character of the smooth muscle that comprises this tissue. We performed transcriptome analysis to identify genes that are enriched in intestinal mesenchyme tissue at E14.5, when the inner circular muscle (ICM) is well established. Results: Expression patterns of enriched mesenchyme genes were examined in publicly available in situ databases, revealing over one hundred genes that are expressed in the ICM. Examination of the promoter regions for these genes revealed enrichment for cJUN transcription factor binding sites and cJUN itself was also enriched in ICM. A cJUN ChIP-seq at E14.5 showed that cJUN regulatory regions contained characteristics of muscle enhancers.

Embryonic piRNAs consist of both primary and secondary species and are mainly directed toward transposons. In meiotic cells, however, the piRNA population is transposon-poor and restricted to primary piRNAs derived from pachytene piRNA clusters. The mechanism controlling which piRNAs are present at each developmental stage is poorly understood. Here we show that RNF17 shapes adult meiotic piRNA content by suppressing the production of secondary piRNAs. In the absence of RNF17, ping-pong (secondary amplification) occurs inappropriately in meiotic cells, aberrantly targeting protein-coding genes and lncRNAs. Our data indicate that RNF17 comprises one component of a "refereeing" mechanism that prevents deleterious activity of the meiotic piRNA pathway by ensuring the selective loading of PIWI proteins with products of meiotic piRNA clusters.

Although several genes that regulate this transition have been identified, how it is controlled and coordinated remains poorly understood. Here we examine the role in male gametogenesis of the Doublesex-related gene Dmrt6 (Dmrtb1) and find that Dmrt6 plays a critical role in directing germ cells through the mitotic to meiotic germ cell transition. DMRT6 protein is expressed in late mitotic spermatogonia. In mice of the C57BL/6J strain a null mutation in Dmrt6 disrupts spermatogonial differentiation, causing expression in inappropriate cell types of spermatogonial differentiation factors including SOHLH1, SOHLH2 and DMRT1 and the meiotic initiation factor STRA8 and causing most late spermatogonia to undergo apoptosis. In mice of the 129Sv background, most Dmrt6 mutant spermatogonia can complete differentiation and enter meiosis, but they show defects in chromosome pairing, establishment of the XY body, and processing of recombination foci, and mainly arrest in mid-pachynema. mRNA profiling of Dmrt6 mutant testes together with DMRT6 ChIP-seq suggest that DMRT6 represses genes involved in spermatogonial differentiation and activates genes required for meiotic prophase. Our results indicate that Dmrt6 plays a key role in coordinating the transition in gametogenic programs from spermatogonial differentiation and mitosis to spermatocyte development and meiosis.

Yes|GSE50809|Done|Baseline|RNA-Seq|2018-01-24|119|1410|Temporally defined neocortical translation and polysome assembly is determined by the RNA-binding protein, Hu antigen R|Precise spatiotemporal control of mRNA translation machinery is essential to proper development of highly complex systems like the neocortex. Here, we show that an RNA-binding protein, Hu antigen R (HuR), regulates both neocorticogenesis and specificity of neocortical translation machinery in a developmental stage-dependent manner in mice. Neocortical absence of HuR alters the phosphorylation states of the initiation and elongation factors of the core translation machinery. In addition, HuR regulates the temporally specific positioning of functionally related mRNAs into the active translation sites, the polysomes. HuR also determines the specificity of neocortical polysomes by defining their combinatorial composition of ribosomal proteins and initiation and elongation factors. For some of the HuR-dependent proteins, the association with polysomes depends on the eIF2 alpha kinase 4 (eIF2ak4), which associated with HuR in prenatal developing neocortices. Finally, we found that deletion of HuR prior to embryonic day 10 (E10) disrupts both neocortical lamination and formation of the main neocortical commissure, the corpus callosum. Our study identifies a crucial role for HuR in neocortical development as a translational gatekeeper for functionally related mRNA subgroups and polysomal protein specificity.

Here, we show that Tet1 is expressed and non-redundantly contributes to 5-hydroxymethylctyosine (5hmC) non-redundantly in the pre-gastrulation mouse epiblast. Ablation of Tet1 in primed epiblast cells results in widespread loss of 5hmC associated with gain of 5-methylcytosine at CpG islands and promoters.  Moreover, Tet1 is expressed, albeit at lower levels, in the extra-embryonic ectoderm. Tet1-deficiency in the pre-streak mouse embryos causes dysregulation of early lineage regulators in the epiblast and increased expression of metabolic genes in the extra-embryonic ectoderm. Our studies reveal a distinct role of Tet1 in regulating the methylome landscape of the post-implantation mammalian epiblast and a hitherto unknown gene repressive effect in the extra-embryonic lineage, providing insights into the early developmental origins of epigenetic-based basis of imprinting and developmental disorders. Lysates of E6.25 epiblast (E) and extra-embryonic (ExE) tissues were pooled, based on retrospective genotyping, from at least 6 embryos (collected from 2-3 litters). Four pooled biological replicates were collected for each tissue compartment and each genotype, i.e. wild type (wt), Tet1gt/wt (Zwt), Tet1gt/gt(ZZ); in 3 of 4 pooled replicates, the E and ExE samples were obtained from the same litters and given the same numbering. One ExE sample of ZZ was lost.  RNA was purified using the RNeasy micro Kit (Qiagen) to obtain 1-10 ng of RNA per pool. RNA quality was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 6000 Pico chip and only samples with RNA integrity number (RIN) > 8.0 were processed further. First-strand cDNA synthesis and amplification was performed by using the SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA amplification kit v3 (Clontech).

The anterior pole of the mouse embryo is established when Distal Visceral Endoderm (DVE) cells migrate to form the Anterior Visceral Endoderm (AVE). Asymmetrical expression of Lefty1, Cerl and Dkk determines the direction of DVE migration and the future anterior side. Besides being implicated in the establishment of Anterior-Posterior axis the AVE has also been correlated with anterior neural specification.  In order to better understand the role of the AVE in these processes, this cell population was isolated using a cerlP-EGFP transgenic mouse line, and a differential screening was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip technology. From this differential screening, 175 genes were found to be upregulated in the AVE, whereas 35 genes were upregulated in the Proximal-posterior sample. Using DAVID, here we characterize the AVE cell population regarding cellular component, molecular function and biological processes. Among the genes that were found to be upregulated in the AVE, several novel genes with expression in the AVE were identified. Four of the identified transcripts displaying high-fold change were further characterized by in situ hybridization in early stages of development in order to validate the screening. From those four selected genes, ADTK1 was chosen to be functionally characterized by targeted inactivation in ES cells. ADTK1 encodes for an unknown serine/threonine kinase. ADTK null mutants present short limbs and defects in the eye and ear. Taken together, these data point to the importance of reporting novel genes present in the AVE. Anterior distal and Posterior proximal portions of an E5.5 mouse embryo were microdissected.

Here we report that deletion of both Gsk-3a and Gsk-3b in mouse ESCs results in misregulated expression of imprinted genes and hypomethylation of corresponding imprinted loci. Treatment of wild-type ESCs with small molecule inhibitors of Gsk-3 phenocopies the DNA hypomethylation of imprinted loci observed in Gsk-3 null ESCs. We provide evidence that DNA hypomethylation in Gsk-3 null ESCs is due to a reduction in the levels of the de novo DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt3a2. Gsk-3 activity serves as a node for several signal transduction pathways, and its regulation of Dnmt3a2 expression raises the possibility that DNA methylation could be transiently affected by different types of environmental stimuli. Our data suggest that modulating Gsk-3 activity could have further reaching effects in the regulation of the epigenome.

These tumors are thought to arise within the cerebellum, with approximately 25% originating from granule neuron precursor cells (GNPCs) following aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (hereafter, SHH-subtype).  The pathological processes that drive heterogeneity among the other medulloblastoma subtypes are not known, hindering the development of much needed new therapies.  Here, we provide evidence that a discrete subtype of medulloblastoma that contains activating mutations in the WNT pathway effector CTNNB1 (hereafter, WNT-subtype), arises outside the cerebellum from cells of the dorsal brainstem. We found that genes marking human WNT-subtype medulloblastomas are more frequently expressed in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) and embryonic dorsal brainstem than in the upper rhombic lip (URL) and developing cerebellum.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-operative reports showed that human WNT-subtype tumors infiltrate the dorsal brainstem, while SHH-subtype tumors are located within the cerebellar hemispheres.  Activating mutations in Ctnnb1 had little impact on progenitor cell populations in the cerebellum, but caused the abnormal accumulation of cells on the embryonic dorsal brainstem that included aberrantly proliferating Zic1+ precursor cells.  These lesions persisted in all mutant adult mice and in 15% of cases in which Tp53 was concurrently deleted, progressed to form medulloblastomas that recapitulated the anatomy and gene expression profiles of human WNT-subtype medulloblastoma.  We provide the first evidence that subtypes of medulloblastoma have distinct cellular origins.  Our data provide an explanation for the marked molecular and clinical differences between SHH and WNT-subtype medulloblastomas and have profound implications for future research and treatment of this important childhood cancer.

Acupuncture was performed by hand two hr after the first MPTP injection and then at forty-eight hr intervals (fourteen total sessions). The acupuncture procedure (acupoint GB34 (Yanglingquan) and acupoint LR3 (Taichong) for acupoints; both sides of the hips for non-acupoints) was performed as previously reported. Mice in the acupoints group were immobilized by hand two hr after MPTP administration. Acupuncture needles were inserted bilaterally to depths of 1 mm at acupoint LR3 and 3 mm at acupoint GB34, and then turned at a rate of two spins per sec for fifteen sec as reported in a previous study. For the non-acupoints group, the needles were inserted to depths of 3 mm at both sides of the hips rather than at the acupoints GB34 and LR3 for the acupoints group, and then the same procedures were performed as with the acupoints.;

Here we investigate the contribution of sex chromosomal complement to such sexual dimorphisms. These genome-wide transcription profiling showed that the expression of hundreds of autosomal genes was sensitive to sex chromosome complement, rather than gender. The existence of such differences between males and females holds important implications for understanding sexual dimorphisms in physiology and disease hitherto attributed solely to gender or hormonal effects.

Here we explore whether the severity of C. burnetii infection in mice is related to differences in male and female gene expression profiles. Mice were infected with C. burnetii for 24 hours, and gene expression was measured in liver cells using microarrays. Multiclass analysis identified 2,777 probes for which expression was specifically modulated by C. burnetti infection. Only 14% of the modulated genes were sex-independent, and the remaining 86% were differentially expressed in males and females. Castration of males and females showed that sex hormones were responsible for more than 60% of the observed gene modulation, and this reduction was most pronounced in males.  Using functional annotation of modulated genes, we identified four clusters enriched in males that were related to cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, defensins and cytokine/Jak-Stat pathways. Up-regulation of the IL-10 and Stat-3 genes may account for the high susceptibility of men with Q fever to C. burnetii infection and autoantibody production. Two clusters were identified in females, including the circadian rhythm pathway, which consists of positive (Clock, Arntl) and negative (Per) limbs of a feedback loop. We found that Clock and Arntl were down-modulated whereas Per was up-regulated; these changes may be associated with efficient bacterial elimination in females but not in males, in which an exacerbated host response would be prominent. This large-scale study revealed for the first time that circadian rhythm plays a major role in the anti-infectious response of mice, and it provides a new basis for elucidating the role of sexual dimorphism in human infections. Liver transcriptome was analyzed using whole genome microarray. Forty mice were divided into 8 groups of five mice upon three binary factors: sex, infection and castration.

Although blood levels of PFOS have begun to decline, health concerns remain because of the long half-life of PFOS in humans. Like other PFAAs, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), PFOS is an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR  ) and exhibits hepatocarcinogenic potential in rodents.  PFOS is also a developmental toxicant in rodents where, unlike PFOA, it   s mode of action is independent of PPAR  .  Wild-type (WT) and PPAR  -null (Null) mice were dosed with 0, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day PFOS for 7 days.  Animals were euthanized, livers weighed, and liver samples collected for histology and preparation of total RNA.  Gene profiling was conducted using Affymetrix 430_2 microarrays.  In WT mice, PFOS induced changes that were characteristic of PPAR   transactivation including regulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism, peroxisome biogenesis, proteasome activation, and inflammation.  PPAR  -independent changes were indicated in both WT and Null mice by altered expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, and xenobiotic metabolism.  Such results are similar to prior studies done with PFOA and are consistent with modest activation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and possibly PPAR   and/or PPAR  /  .  Unique treatment-related effects were also found in Null mice including altered expression of genes associated with ribosome biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol biosynthesis. Of interest was up-regulation of Cyp7a1, a gene which is under the control of various transcription regulators.  Hence, in addition to its ability to modestly activate PPAR  , PFOS induces a variety of    off-target    effects as well.  PPARalpha-null and wild-type male mice at 6-9 months of age were dosed by gavage for 7 consecutive days with either 0, 3, or 10 mg/kg PFOS (potassium salt) in 0.5% Tween 20.   Five biological replicates consisting of individual animals were included in each dosage group.

To directly address the function of myeloid CD13 we created a CD13 null mouse and assessed the responses of purified primary macrophages or dendritic cells from wild type and CD13 null animals in cell assays and inflammatory disease models where CD13 has been previously implicated.  We find that mice lacking CD13 develop normally with normal hematopoietic profiles.  Moreover, in in vitro assays, CD13 appears to be largely dispensable for the aspects of phagocytosis, proliferation and antigen presentation that we tested, but may contribute to adhesion to endothelial cells.  In vivo assessment of four inflammatory disease models showed that lack of CD13 has little effect on disease onset or progression.  Nominal alterations in gene expression levels between CD13 wild type and null macrophages argue against compensatory mechanisms.   Analysis of the dataset with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software did not suggest that loss of CD13 resulted in a purturbation of any specific biological pathways, processes or networks.  Therefore, while CD13 is highly expressed on myeloid cells and is a reliable marker of the myeloid lineage of both normal and leukemic cells, it is not a critical regulator of hematopoietic development, hemostasis or myeloid cell function. Method:RNA was isolated from resting peritoneal or bone marrow derived macrophages from wild type or CD13 null mice using Trizol according to the manufacturer   s protocol.  For quality control, RNA purity and integrity was evaluated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, OD 260/280 ratio and analysis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).  Total RNA was amplified and purified using the Ambion Ilumina RNA amplification kit (Ambion, www.ambion.com).  Briefly, 300 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a T7 oligo(dT) primer. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized, in vitro transcribed and labeled with biotin-16-UTP. The labeled cRNA was analyzed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantitated by Nanodrop analysis (www.nanodrop.com). The labeled cRNAs were hybridized to the Mouse WholeGenome- 6 BeadChip (Illumina Inc.,) for 16 hours at 58  C, as per manufacturer's instructions. The BeadChips were washed, stained with streptavidin-Cy3 and scanned on the Illumina BeadArray Reader. Analysis:Microarray data was extracted, normalized and analyzed using Illumina GenomeStudio software. Illumina MouseWG-6 v 2.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) contains 50-mer gene specific oligonucleotide probes corresponding to 45,281 mouse transcript variants.  There is on average a 30-fold redundancy for each transcript per array. Intensity data were normalized using the Quantile algorithm in GenomeStudio. Differential expression of each gene, relative to the respective control was evaluated using the Illumina custom error model that calculates a p value as a function of intensity, differential and biological, technical and nonspecific variation.  Those samples with p values less than 0.05 were deleted, the relative expression of CD13 null vs. wild type calculated and expressed as fold wild type, and the data ranked from low to high expression relative to wild type values.

The importance of transcription-factor mediated induction or repression of mRNA synthesis is well established, but the role and mechanisms of RNA degradation are less well understood. We globally evaluated the RNA decay rates in proliferating and differentiated mouse myoblasts on whole-genome Affymetrix exon arrays, allowing for the assessment of directionality of RNA degradation and the detection of splice variant-specific differences in RNA decay rates. We found large differences in decay rates. mRNAs coding for proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation have shortest half lives, whereas mRNAs coding for DNA replication enzymes and muscle contraction proteins are among the most stable. Many genes differentially expressed between proliferating and differentiated myoblasts demonstrate major differences in RNA decay rates. Quantitative PCR experiments confirmed the higher stability of transcripts with increased expression levels. RNA degradation has no apparent preferential directionality. RNA degradation appears to affect the ratio of different splice variants. For example, Itga7 isoforms with higher abundance in differentiated than in proliferating cells are more stable in differentiated cells, despite the sharing of a common 3    untranslated region. Thus, where it was previously thought that the abundance of different splice isoforms was mainly controlled by tissue-specific splicing factors, we now demonstrate that isoforms may be produced at comparable levels but degraded with different efficiencies, depending on the differentiation status of the cells. Our results indicate that control of RNA degradation rates contributes significantly to the differentiation stage-dependent differences in abundance of transcripts and splice variants.

(ostrich) on body weight, the intestinal microbiome and metabolism in mice|Background. Food can affect the microbial balance in the human intestine, and the ingestion of probiotics may play a role in the current obesity pandemic. The objective of our study was to determine if increased Lactobacillus spp. in the intestinal microflora of mice can promote growth and if changes in the intestinal microflora are associated with modifications in metabolism. Methodology. Female BALBc mice were divided between one control and two experimental groups and inoculated either once or twice with 4  1010 Lactobacillus per animal in PBS or with PBS alone. Fecal samples were collected and tested using qPCR to detect and quantify Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Gene expression by microarray and RT-PCR was studied in liver and adipose tissue. Finally, metabolic parameters in the plasma were tested. Principal Findings. In three independent experiments, we observed an increase in both weight gain and liver weight in mice inoculated with 4  1010 Lactobacillus. Inoculation with Lactobacillus sp. (ostrich) increased the Lactobacillus spp. and Firmicutes DNA copy number in feces. The transcriptional profile of liver tissue from mice inoculated with Lactobacillus sp. (ostrich) was enriched for Gene Ontology terms related to the immune response and metabolic modifications. The mRNA levels of fatty acyl synthase (Fas), sterol regulatory element binding factor 1 (Srebp1c), tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf), cytochrome P450 2E1 (Cyp2e1) and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdpk1) were significantly elevated in liver tissue in experimental group animals. In gonadal adipose tissue, the expression of leptin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg and Srebp1c was significantly higher in experimental group animals, whereas the expression of adiponectin was significantly lower. Conclusions. Alterations in the intestinal microbiota resulted in increased weight gain. Furthermore, increased Lactobacillus spp. in the intestinal microflora of mice inoculated with Lactobacillus sp. (ostrich) resulted in accelerated weight gain, liver enlargement and metabolic changes in the plasma, liver and adipose tissue. For microarray analysis, we used the livers from two LB1 and two control mice that had been euthanized 20 days after inoculation. We used a whole mouse genome oligomicroarray 4x44K kit (44,000 60-mer oligonucleotides) and performed a one-color microarray-based gene expression analysis, as previously described. Labeled RNAs (Low RNA Input Fluorescent Amplification Kit, Perkin Elmer) were deposited on slides and hybridized using an in situ Hybridization Plus Kit (Agilent Technologies) for 17 h. The arrays were scanned using a DNA Microarray Scanner G2505B (Agilent Technologies), and the image analysis and correction of intra-array signals were performed using Feature Extraction Software A.9.1.3 (Agilent Technologies). Microarray data analysis was performed using GeneSpring 10.01 with the default setting for inter-array normalization and inter-replicate corrections. To identify genes that were differentially expressed, we used a Student   s t-test with p<0.05, and an absolute fold change (FC) greater than 2.0 considered significant. An analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms was performed to identify any altered biological processes. Additional data analysis was performed using R software, version 2.8.1.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as described above. Primers and probes to target the mouse genes for cytochrome P450 2E1 (Cyp2e1), 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdpk1) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh, used as a housekeeping gene) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. qPCR reactions were performed as described above. The relative amount of each examined mRNA was normalized to the Gapdh mRNA expression level and is expressed relative to the mean amount of the same mRNA in the control group. .. female;  total RNA;  control mouse;  stuff mouse;  BALBc;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  LB1;  control;

Very few CHD-causing genes have been identified so far; so, to discover further genes we performed a global transcriptome analysis in mouse models of CHD. Methods and results: By the use of a retinoic acid competitive antagonist (BMS-189453) we caused CHD, thymic abnormalities and neural tube defects in mouse newborns. Transposition of great arteries was the prevalent cardiac defect observed (61%). Recently we were able to partially rescue this abnormal phenotype by oral administration of folic acid. Now we have performed a microarray analysis in mouse embryos (8.5 dpc) treated with BMS-189453 alone and with BMS-189453 plus folic acid (FA). On the basis of microarray and QRT-PCR results, we deeper analysed Hif1   because of its down-regulation in BMS-treated embryos vs WT and its increased expression level in BMS+FA treated embryos compared to BMS-treated ones. Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed the under-expression of Hif1   protein in BMS-treated embryos compared to WT and BMS+FA treated ones and moreover demonstrated that at 8.5 dpc Hif1   is mainly expressed in the embryo's heart. Conclusion: We propose that Hif1   down-regulation by blocking retinoic acid binding, may contribute to the development of the cardiac defects of mouse newborns. In line with our hypothesis, when Hif1   expression level is restored (by supplementation of folic acid) a decrement of CHD is found.

Here we aim to investigate the interaction between adipose tissue and liver in NAFLD, and identify potential early plasma markers that predict NASH.   Research Design and Methods: C57Bl/6 mice were chronically fed a high fat diet to induce NAFLD and compared with mice fed low fat diet. Extensive histological and phenotypical analyses coupled with a time-course study of plasma proteins using multiplex assay was performed.   Results: Mice exhibited pronounced heterogeneity in liver histological scoring, leading to classification into 4 subgroups: LF-low (LFL) responders displaying normal liver morphology, LF-high (LFH) responders showing benign hepatic steatosis, HF-low (HFL) responders displaying pre-NASH with macrovesicular lipid droplets, and HF-high (HFH) responders exhibiting overt NASH characterized by ballooning of hepatocytes, presence of Mallory bodies, and activated inflammatory cells. Compared to HFL responders, HFH mice gained weight more rapidly and exhibited adipose tissue dysfunction characterized by decreased final fat mass, enhanced macrophage infiltration and inflammation, and adipose tissue remodelling. Plasma haptoglobin, IL-1  , TIMP-1, adiponectin and leptin were significantly changed in HFH mice. Multivariate analysis indicated that in addition to leptin, plasma CRP, haptoglobin, eotaxin and MIP-1   early in the intervention were positively associated with liver triglycerides. Intermediate prognostic markers of liver triglycerides included IL-18, IL-1  , MIP-1   and MIP-2, whereas insulin, TIMP-1, GCP-2 and MPO emerged as late markers.  Conclusions: Our data support the existence of a tight relationship between adipose tissue dysfunction and NASH pathogenesis and point to several novel potential predictive biomarkers for NASH.

It is caused by RVF virus which can infect both humans and animals. In humans, it leads to various manifestations including hepatitis, encephalitis and death, while in domestic animals it usually causes miscarriage in pregnant females and it is often fatal for the newborn. Not all people or animal infected by the virus present the same disease. Some patients exhibit unapparent or moderate febrile reactions, while others develop severe symptoms. This observation suggests that host genetic factors play a role in controlling the outcome of infection. In this work, we compare the response of two different inbred strains of mice, MBT/Pas and BALB/cByJ, to infection with RVF virus. These strains exhibit different profiles of susceptibility to RVF virus infection. Indeed, MBT/Pas mice rapidly develop high viraemia and die soon after infection, while BALB/cByJ mice have a lower viraemia and die later. Interestingly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) obtained from MBT/Pas foetuses allows higher viral production than BALB/cByJ MEFs.

Repression of these regulatory targets leads to decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mRNA levels, but the relative contributions of these two outcomes have been largely unknown, particularly for endogenous targets expressed at low-to-moderate levels. Here, we use ribosome profiling to measure the overall effects on protein production and compare these to simultaneously measured effects on mRNA levels. For both ectopic and endogenous miRNA regulatory interactions, lowered mRNA levels account for most (   84%) of the decreased protein production. These results show that changes in mRNA levels closely reflect the impact of miRNAs on gene expression and indicate that destabilization of target mRNAs is the predominant reason for reduced protein output.

HIFs bind to hypoxia response elements in target genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which is continually produced by podocytes throughout life.  To further assess function of HIFs in podocyte biology, podocin-Cre mice were mated with floxed von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mice to selectively delete VHL, a component of an E3 ligase complex responsible for degradation of HIFs in normoxia. We reasoned that cells lacking VHL would overexpress stable HIFs and upregulate hypoxia-responsive genes.  Progeny from these crosses displayed two phenotypes, non-proteinuric with glomerular basement membrane (GBM) defects and proteinuric with GBM defects and end-stage renal failure at ~6 months of age.  Gene changes associated with the mild, non-proteinuric phenotype were studied using isolated glomeruli from wildtype and Pod-Cre fVHL mice. At 4 weeks of age, urine was collected and urinary albumin was quantified by Albuwell elisa from Pod-Cre fVHL litters.

The model was generated through retroviral insertional mutagenesis in Gata1s mutant fetal liver progenitors. In this study, we analyzed the dependency of these leukemic cells on the Gata1s mutant protein. Here we report Gata1s mutant leukemic cells were dependent on this mutant protein. Introduction of the full-length Gata1 protein to these cells led to their reduced proliferation and increased differentiation along the megakaryocytic lineage. We transduced leukemic cells with Gata1/estrogen receptor fusion cDNA (Gata1-ER) and generated stable cell lines.

However, the function of TDP-43 in motor neurons remains undefined. Here, we employ both gain- and loss-of-function approaches to determine roles of TDP-43 in motor neurons. Mice expressing human TDP-43 in neurons exhibited growth retardation and premature death that are characterized by abnormal intranuclear inclusions comprised of TDP-43 and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS), and massive accumulation of mitochondria in TDP-43-negative cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons, lack of mitochondria in motor axon terminals and immature neuromuscular junctions. Whereas elevated level of TDP-43 disrupts the normal nuclear distribution of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN)-associated Gemini of coiled bodies (GEMs) in motor neurons, its absence prevents the formation of GEMs in the nuclei of these cells. Moreover, transcriptome-wide deep sequencing analysis revealed that decrease in abundance of neurofilament transcripts contributed to the reduction of caliber of motor axons in TDP-43 mice. In concert, our findings indicate that TDP-43 participates in pathways critical for motor neuron physiology, including those that regulate the normal distributions of SMN-associated GEMs in the nucleus and mitochondria in the cytoplasm.

The metabolic defect leads to a complex phenotype involving the viscera, the bone marrow and the skeleton. However the prevailing macrophage-centric view of the disease does not explain emerging aspects of the disease such as hematological malignancies, autoimmune diathesis, Parkinson   s disease and osteoporosis poorly responsive to macrophage targeted enzyme therapy or anti-resorptive therapies. We developed a conditional KO mouse model of GD1 to delineate cells and pathways in GD1. By targeting the cells of the hematopoetic and mesenchymal cell lineages through an Mx1 promoter, we recapitulated human GD1.    We show that, in addition to significant visceral and hematologic disease, GD1 mice show profound osteopenia due to a bone formation defect.  Cytokine measurements, microarray analysis and cellular immunophenotyping together point to widespread dysfunction of macrophages and other immune cells together with a striking abnormality in thymic T-cell development. Our study provides the first direct evidence for the involvement of cell lineages other than mononuclear phagocytes, most notably osteoblasts and T cells, in the pathophysiology of the clinical spectrum of type 1 GD. These findings have important implications for treatment of GD1. We hypothesize that regulation of gene expression is different in Gaucher disease compared with the normal controls. This difference may even be evident in the different stages of this disease. In order to gain insight to the genes that are potentially involved in the development of Gaucher disease in its different clinical stages, exon-array is chosen for this genome-wide association studies.  Mouse liver and spleen samples from normal control, GD with moderate to severe splenomegaly/hepatomegaly, together nine samples were chosen.  The goal is to find out genes of which the expression may relate to the GD or the severity of GD and thus help identify genetic modifier genes that may contribute to the onset and development of Gaucher disease. .. control;  mild hepatomegaly;  moderate splenomegaly;  severe hepatomegaly;  severe splenomegaly;  splenomegaly (not enlarged);  total RNA;  Liver-control;  Liver-mild;  Liver-severe;  Spleen-control;  Spleen-disease-moderate;  Spleen-disease-no-enlarge;  Spleen-severe;  mixed 129svj and C57 BL/6 background;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  spleen;

Since alterations of p53-dependent pathway are common hallmarks of aggressive, poor prognostic human cancers, these mouse models can recapitulate the molecular features of some of these human malignancies. To evaluate this possibility, gene expression microarray analysis was performed in mouse samples. The mouse tumors display increased expression of cell cycle and chromosomal instability associated genes. Remarkably, they are also enriched in human embryonic stem cell gene signatures, a characteristic feature of human aggressive tumors. Using cross-species comparison and meta-analytical approaches, we also observed that spontaneous mouse tumors display robust similarities with gene expression profiles of human tumors bearing mutated TP53, or displaying poor prognostic outcome, from multiple body tissues. We have obtained a 20-gene signature whose genes are overexpressed in mouse tumors and can identify human tumors with poor outcome from breast cancer, astrocytoma and multiple myeloma. This signature was consistently overexpressed in additional mouse tumors using microarray analysis. Two of the genes of this signature, AURKA and UBE2C, were validated in human breast and cervical cancer as potential biomarkers of malignancy. Our analyses demonstrate that these mouse models are promising preclinical tools aimed to search for malignancy biomarkers and to test targeted therapies of prospective use in human aggressive tumors and/or with p53 mutation or inactivation.

It remains unclear whether iPS cells generated from different cell types are molecularly and functionally similar. Here, we show that iPS cells obtained from fibroblasts, hematopoietic and myogenic cells exhibit distinct transcriptional and epigenetic patterns. Moreover, we demonstrate that cellular origin influences the in vitro differentiation potentials of iPS cells into embryoid bodies and different hematopoietic cells. Our results suggest that low-passage iPS cells retain a transient epigenetic memory of their somatic cells of origin, which manifests as differential gene expression and altered differentiation capacity. These observations might affect ongoing attempts to use iPS cells for disease modeling and also could be exploited for potential therapeutic applications to enhance differentiation into desired cell lineages.

We sought to decipher complex genomic data sets by matching the genetic alterations contained within these, with candidate cells of origin, to generate accurate disease models.  Using an integrated genomic analysis we first identified subgroups of human ependymoma: a form of neural tumor that arises throughout the central nervous system (CNS).  Validated alterations included amplifications and homozygous deletions of genes not yet implicated in ependymoma.  Matching the transcriptomes of human ependymoma subgroups to those of distinct types of mouse radial glia (RG)   neural stem cells (NSCs) that we identified previously to be a candidate cell of origin of ependymoma - allowed us to select RG types most likely to represent cells of origin of disease subgroups.  The transcriptome of human cerebral ependymomas that amplify EPHB2 and delete INK4A/ARF matched most closely that of embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf-/- RG:  remarkably, activation of EphB2 signaling in this RG type, but not others, generated highly penetrant ependymomas that modeled accurately the histology and transcriptome of one human cerebral tumor subgroup (subgroup    D   ).  Further comparative genomic analysis revealed selective alterations in the copy number and expression of genes that regulate neural differentiation, particularly synaptogenesis, in both mouse and human subgroup    D    ependymomas; pinpointing this pathway as a previously unknown target of ependymoma tumorigenesis.

P. gingivalis strain 381 was injected into the subcutaneous soft tissue over the calvaria of BALB/c mice for 3 days, after which the soft tissues and calvarial bones were excised.  RNA was isolated from infected soft tissues and calvarial bones and analyzed for transcript profiles using Murine GeneChip   MG-MOE430A Affymetrix arrays to provide a molecular profile of the events that occur following infection of these tissues.

Constitutive expression of the chemokine CXCL12 by bone marrow stromal cells provides a key retention signal for neutrophils in the bone marrow through activation of its receptor CXCR4.  Herein, we show that the ELR chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 are constitutively expressed by bone marrow endothelial cells and osteoblasts, and CXCL2 expression is induced in endothelial cells during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced neutrophil mobilization. Neutrophils lacking CXCR2, the receptor for CXCL1 and CXCL2, are preferentially retained in the bone marrow, reproducing a myelokathexis phenotype.  Transient disruption of CXCR4 failed to mobilize CXCR2 neutrophils.  However, doubly deficient neutrophils (CXCR2-/- CXCR4-/-) displayed constitutive mobilization, showing that CXCR4 plays a dominant role. Collectively, these data suggest that CXCR2 signaling is a second chemokine axis that interacts antagonistically with CXCR4 to regulate neutrophil release from the bone marrow.

Its function in hematopoiesis has not yet been revealed. Mkl1, a cofactor of Srf, is part of the t(1;22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, and plays a critical role in megakaryopoiesis. In order to test the role of Srf in megakaryocyte development, we crossed Pf4-Cre mice, which express Cre recombinase in cells committed to the megakaryocytic lineage, to SrfF/F mice in which functional Srf is no longer expressed after Cre-mediated excision. Pf4-Cre/SrfF/F (KO) mice are born with normal mendelian frequency, but have significant macrothrombocytopenia with approximately 50% reduction in platelet count. In contrast, the BM has increased numbers and percentages of CD41+ megakaryocytes (WT: 0.41+/-0.06%; KO: 1.92+/-0.12%) with significantly reduced ploidy. KO mice show significantly increased megakaryocyte progenitors in the BM by both FACS analysis and CFU-Mk. Megakaryocytes lacking Srf have abnormal stress fiber and demarcation membrane formation and platelets lacking Srf have abnormal actin distribution. In vitro and in vivo assays reveal platelet function defects in KO mice. Critical actin cytoskeletal genes are downregulated in KO megakaryocytes. Thus, Srf is required for normal megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production, due at least in part, to regulation of cytoskeletal genes. C-kit+CD41+ megakaryocyte progenitors from PF4-Cre/SRF C57BL/6 SRF WT (3) and C57BL/6 SRF KO (3) mice were sorted by flow cytometry and cultured for three days in thrombopoietin. ..

Metabolic 75Se-labeling and Northern and Western blot analyses revealed that more than 90% of Sep15 was knocked down. Growth of the resulting Sep15-deficient CT26 cells was reduced (p<0.01) and cells formed significantly (p<0.001) fewer colonies in soft agar compared to control CT26 cells. Whereas most (14/15) BALB/c mice injected with control cells developed tumors, few (3/30) mice injected with Sep15 knockdown cells developed tumors (p<0.0001). The ability to form pulmonary metastases had similar results. Mice injected with the plasmid-transfected control cells had >250 lung metastases/mouse; however, mice injected with the Sep15 knockdown cells only had 7.8 +/- 5.4 metastases. To investigate molecular targets affected by Sep15 status, gene expression patterns between control and knockdown CT26 cells were compared. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis was used to analyze the 1045 genes that were significantly (p<0.001) affected by Sep15 deficiency. The highest scored biological functions were cancer and cellular growth and proliferation. Consistent with these observations, subsequent analyses revealed a G2/M cell cycle arrest in Sep15 CT26 knockdown cells. In contrast, to CT26 cells Sep15 knockdown in Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC1) cells did not affect anchorage-dependent or    independent cell growth. These data suggest tissue specificity in the cancer protective effects of Sep15 knockdown, which are mediated, at least in part, by influencing the cell cycle. mRNA was isolated from plasmid-transfected control and shSep15 knockdown CT26 cells (three replicates of each).

The microarray data suggested APAP treatment may upregulate gene expression at multiple levels of the JNK cascade including a JNK-related scaffold protein.  Expression data was related to phosphoprotein levels using the Bioplex system.  APAP treatment led to a significant activation of JNK compared to its regioisomer.  In contrast, microarray analysis of AMAP showed a slight upregulation of ERK gene activity.  Furthermore, Bioplex data showed AMAP treatment led to significant ERK phosphorylation compared to APAP.  Cell viability assays confirmed that  APAP-induced activation of JNK was related to higher rates of cell death, whereas activation of ERK by AMAP may be cytoprotective. 27 arrays, 9 experimental groups, 2hr AMAP, 2hr APAP, 2hr Control, 6hr AMAP, 6hr APAP, 6hr Control, 24hr AMAP, 24hr APAP, 24hr Control. ..

Here we show that conditional deletion of Rb in mouse mammary epithelium led to expansion of the stem/progenitor cells and to focal acinar hyperplasia with squamous metaplasia. These uniform lesions progressed into histologically diverse, transplantable mammary adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas with features of luminal-B or basal-like carcinomas. A subset of basal-like but none of the luminal-B tumors expressed mutant p53. These results demonstrate a causative role for Rb in the etiology of breast cancer subtypes and implicate p53 status as a determinant of tumor phenotype after Rb loss.

Although many previous reports have been proposed for the immunoregulatory functions of TGF-b on T cells, such as the suppression of cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytokine signaling, as well as the induction of apoptosis, it is not well elucidated whether the each effect of TGF-b on T cells is dependent on Smad signaling or Smad-independent other signaling pathways. The aim of the study was to clarify the involvement of Smad signaling and to investigate the redundancy of Smad2 and Smad3 on various TGF-b-mediated regulation of gene expression in CD4+ T cells. We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression regulated by TGF-b in CD4+ T cells, and identified distinct classes of up/down-regulated genes which are dependent on or independent of TGF-b-Smad signaling. Most of genes regulated by TGF-b were redundantly dependent on Smad2 and Smad3, including Foxp3 and IL-2. In addition, some genes were sufficiently regulated via Smad2 or Smad3 signaling alone. In contrast, TGF-b-mediated RORgt induction was independent of Smad signaling. CD4+CD25-CD44loCD62Lhi T cells (naive) were isolated from the spleens in wild-type (WT), T cell-specific Smad2 conditional knockout (Smad2KO or Smad2del/del), Smad3 knockout (Smad3KO or Smad3-/-) or Smad2del/delSmad3+/- mice by using a BD FACS ariaTM cell sorter (BD Bioscience) (purity: >98%). Freshly purified cells were then stimulated with anti-TCR stimuli in the absence or presence of TGF-b for 24 hr, respectively. A complete and precise experimental procedure is given in the "treatment protocol". It was very difficult to obtain the enough number of CD4+CD25-CD44loCD62Lhi naive T cells from Smad2del/delSmad3-/- mice because alomost all of CD4+ T cells were activated in Smad2del/delSmad3-/- mice. We confirmed that the several known Smad-regulated genes were almost out of control in Smad2del/delSmad3+/- CD4+ T cells by using quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, previous studies have reported the similar results in other cell types deficit in two alleles of Smad2 and one allele of Smad3. For these reasons, we substituted Smad2del/delSmad3+/- naive T cells for Smad2/3-deficient naive T cells. Cells were quickly collected 24 hr after culture for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. ..

Particularly, high Evi1 expression defines one of the largest clusters in acute myeloid leukemia and is significantly associated with extremely poor prognosis. Improvement of the therapeutic outcome of leukemia with activated Evi1 is one of the most challenging issues. However, mechanistic basis of Evi1-mediated leukemogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that Evi1 directly represses PTEN transcription in the murine bone marrow, which leads to activation of AKT/mTOR signaling. In a murine bone marrow transplantation model, Evi1 leukemia showed remarkable sensitivity to an mTOR inihibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, we found that Evi1 binds to several polycomb group proteins and recruits polycomb repressive complexes for PTEN downregulation, which reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism of AKT/mTOR activation in leukemia. Expression analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using human samples indicate that our findings in mice models are recapitulated in human leukemic cells. Dependence of Evi1-expressing leukemic cells on AKT/mTOR signaling provides the first example of targeted therapeutic modalities that suppress the leukemogenic activity of Evi1. The PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and the Evi1-polycomb interaction can be promising therapeutic targets for leukemia with activated Evi1.

Sle1a.1 CD4+ T cells showed a defective response to retinoic acid (RA) expansion of TGF  -induced Tregs.  At the molecular level, Sle1a.1 corresponds to an increased expression of a novel splice isoform of Pbx1, Pbx1-d. Pbx1-d over-expression is sufficient to induce an activated/inflammatory phenotype in Jurkat T cells, and to decrease their apoptotic response to RA.  PBX1-d is expressed more frequently in lupus patients than in healthy controls, and its presence correlates with an increased memory T cell population.  These findings indicate that Pbx1 is a novel lupus susceptibility gene that regulates T cell activation and tolerance.

To better understand the process of reprogramming we sought to identify factors that mediate reprogramming at higher efficiency. For this we established an assay to screen nuclear fractions from the extracts of pluripotent cells based on Oct4 reactivation. We identified components of the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, which when used along with the above four factors increase reprogramming efficiency by five-fold and improve the quality of the reprogrammed cells. These cells were found to be capable of germline transmission and exhibited pluripotency according to gene expression and in vivo and in vitro assays. SWI/SNF was found to replace c-Myc and mediate its effects by facilitating recruitment of Oct4 on target promoters during reprogramming. Thus, somatic cell reprogramming using chromatin-remodeling molecules represents an efficient method of generating reprogrammed cells.  DNA-free RNA samples to be hybridized on Illumina expression BeadChips were processed using a linear amplification kit (Ambion) (generating IVT duration: 12h). cRNA samples were quality-checked on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and hybridized as biological triplicates onto MouseWG-6 V2 chips as recommended and using materials / reagents provided by the manufacturer (hybridization time: 18h).

Transcription may be regulated either by binding of the GR dimer to DNA regulatory elements or by protein-protein interactions of GR monomers with other transcription factors. Although the type of regulation for a number of individual target genes is known, the relative contribution of both mechanisms to the regulation of the entire transcriptional program remains elusive. To study the importance of GR dimerization in regulation of gene expression, we performed gene expression profiling in liver of prednisolone-treated wild type (WT) and genetically engineered mice that have lost the ability to form GR-dimers (GRdim). Mice carrying a wild type (WT) glucocorticoid receptor or a dimerization-defective glucocorticoid receptor (GRdim) were treated subcutaneous with vehicle or prednisolone (1mg/kg) and sacrificed 150 minutes later. From the livers of these mice total RNA was extracted, processed and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays.

Bone-derived osteocalcin, in its undercarboxylated, hormonal form, regulates fat deposition and is a potent insulin secretagogue.  Here, we show that insulin receptor (IR) signaling in osteoblasts controls osteoblast development and osteocalcin expression by suppressing the Runx2 inhibitor Twist-2.  Mice lacking IR in osteoblasts have low circulating undercarboxylated osteocalcin and reduced bone acquisition due to decreased bone formation and deficient numbers of osteoblasts.  With age, these mice develop marked peripheral adiposity and hyperglycemia accompanied by severe glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.  The metabolic abnormalities in these mice are improved by infusion of exogenous under-carboxylated osteocalcin.  These results indicate the existence of a bone-pancreas endocrine loop through which insulin signaling in the osteoblast ensures osteoblast differentiation and stimulates osteocalcin production, which in turn regulates insulin sensitivity and pancreatic insulin secretion to control glucose homeostasis. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression changes in response to insulin acting through insulin receptor in osteoblasts and identified distinct genes specifically involved in bone remodeling process. 4 groups and 3 time points (0h as a control, 6h, 12h, and 24h) .. control;  insulin;  osteoblast;  IGF-1 null;  total RNA;  12hr, treated;  24h, treated;  6hr, treated;  control;  10090;  Mus musculus;  0 h;  12 h;  24 h;  6 h;  The cells were serum starved and then treated with 10nM insulin for 6, 12, or 24hr.;

(GUDMAP Series ID: 39)|The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing kidney.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. HoxB7-GFP transgenic mice were utilized to isolate the ureteric bud cells  from E10.5 embryonic kidneys.  The ureteric bud cells were isolated from embryos using microdissection, trypsin treatment and FACS.   The RNA was isolated from purified ureteric bud cells and the gene expression profiles were determined by microarrays. .. 10.5 dpc;  Tg(Hoxb7-EGFP)33Cos / MGI:3715437;  total RNA;  unknown;  ureteric tip;  CD-1;  10090;  Mus musculus;  TS18;  pool size: 1 Ureteric budPooled sample: NoDissection Method: Microdissection, trypsinization & fluorescent activated cell sortingHoxB7-GFP transgenic mice are time-mated.

KIT-ECD versus IT-PTD-mutants were introduced into rodent Ba/F3, EML, Rat2 and human TF1 cells to investigate their biological effect. ECD- and PTD-mutants also displayed distinct whole-genome transcriptional profiles in EML cells. We observed differences in their signaling properties: they both activated STAT pathways, whereas AKT pathway was only activated by ECD-mutants. Consistently, AKT inhibitor suppressed ECD-mutant-dependent proliferation, clonogenicity and erythroid differentiation. Expression of myristoylated AKT restored erythroid differentiation in EMLPTD cells, suggesting the differential role of AKT in those mutants. Overall, our study implied different pathogenesis of pediatric versus adult mastocytosis, which might explain their diverse phenotypes. Each EML cell line (Del417-419insY mutant and D816V mutant) was cultured with or without 250 ng/mL SCF for 48h. Gene expression profile analysis was performed using whole-genome microarrays. RNA expression profiling of cell lines was done with Affymetrix M430 2.0 mouse oligonucleotide microarrays containing 45.101 probe sets, representing 21.408 transcripts and variants including 17.482 well-characterized mouse genes. Preparation of cRNA, hybridizations, washes, detection and quantification were done as recommended by the supplier. For each sample, synthesis of the first-strand cDNA was done from 3   g total RNA by T7-oligo(dT) priming, followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. After purification, in vitro transcription associated with amplification generated cRNA-containing biotinylated pseudouridine. Biotinylated cRNA was purified, quantified and chemically fragmented (95  C for 35 min), then hybridized to microarrays in 200   L hybridization buffer at 45  C for 16 h. Automated washes and staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin were done as recommended. Signal amplification was done by biotinylated antistreptavidin antibody with goat-IgG blocking antibody.

In the developing axial skeleton, sequential SHH and BMP signals are required for specification of a chondrogenic fate in somitic tissue.  A similar paradigm is thought to operate in the limb, but the signals involved are unclear.  To investigate the nature of these signals we examined BMP action in mesenchymal populations derived from the early murine limb bud (~ E10.5).  These populations exhibited a graded response to BMPs, in which early limb mesenchymal (EL) cells (from the distal hind limb) displayed an anti-chondrogenic response, whereas BMPs promoted chondrogenesis in older cell populations. To better understand the molecular basis of disparate BMP action in these various populations, gene expression profiling with Affymetrix microarrays was employed to identify BMP-regulated genes.  These analyses showed that BMPs induced a distinct gene expression pattern in the EL cultures versus later mesenchymal limb populations (IM and LT). Mouse embryos at gestational age E10.5 were collected and various portions of the limb were micro-dissected.  These led to the generation of three populations of cells, early (EL) limb mesenchymal cells from the distal half of the hind limb, an intermediate (IM) population derived from the distal 1/3 of the fore limb, and a later (LT) population from the proximal 2/3 of the fore limb.  Mesenchymal cells were isolated and cultured with and without BMP4 treatment.  RNA was extracted from cultures at either Day 0,1 or 2, labelled and hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarrays.

Whereas numerous preclinical studies demonstrated that blocking angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis could inhibit tumor metastasis, the scarcity of highly selective targeting candidates hampers their translation to the clinic. We employed a new approach consisting of immuno-laser capture microdissection (i-LCM) and transcriptional profiling by means of microarrays in order to identify novel tumor-specific endothelial markers. By using short immunostainings prior to microdissection, specific identification of lymphatic (LECs) and blood (BECs) endothelial cells was allowed. For the subsequent gene expression profiling, a single round of the Ribo-Spia amplification method in combination with the Affymterix microarray platform was used.

The bacterium can replicate both in its arthropod host and in mammals, including humans. The control mechanisms for bacterial gene expression within eukaryotic host cells are largely unknown. Previously, we reported that the O. tsutsugamushi genome has the highest repeat density of any sequenced bacterial genome due to the extraordinary proliferation of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), suggesting a unique genomic evolution in intracellular niches. In this study, the global gene expression of O. tsutsugamushi within eukaryotic cells was examined using a microarray and proteomic approaches. These approaches identified 643 genes, corresponding to approximately 30% of genes encoded in the genome. The majority of expressed genes belonged to several functional categories including protein translation, protein processing/secretion, and replication/repair. We also searched the conserved sequence blocks (CSBs) in the genomes of different O. tsutsugamushi strains to identify gene blocks impermeable to proliferating MGEs. Although extensive shuffling of genomic sequences was observed between two different strains, 204 CSBs with sizes ranging from 1 kbp to 29 kbp, covering 48% of the genome, were identified. When combining the data of the CSBs and global gene expression, CSBs in the O. tsutsugamushi genomes correlates well with the location of expressed genes, especially in protein level, suggesting the functional conservation between gene expression and genomic location. Finally, we compared global gene expression of the bacteria infecting fibroblasts and macrophages using microarray analysis. Major changes in the expression of genes with known functions were the downregulation of genes involved in translation, protein processing and secretion, which resulted in significant reduction in bacterial translation rates and growth within macrophages. These results suggest that the replication of O. tsutsgamushi is controlled primarily by the expression of genes involved in bacterial translation and subsequent protein processing/secretion. Microarray analysis using the Combimatrix CustomArrayTM 4X2 microarray (CombiMatrix) was performed according to the standard CombiMatrix protocol described in detail at http://www.combimatrix.com/ products_custom4x2.htm (PTL005). Oligonucleotide probes (27 to 40-mers, 1613 probes) were designed for 1472 CDSs of the O. tsutsugamushi genome (GeneBank accession no. AM494475). 1 to 6 probes per CDS were designed and some probes were duplicated on the microarray (total 2187 spots on an array). As negative controls, 5 and 15 oligonucleotide probes derived from plant and bacteriophage respectively were spotted on the array at 53 sites per array. A local background subtraction method was used and the background-subtracted signal values were imported into the Avadis Prophetic software (ver. 3.3, Strand Genomics) or Expander (ver. 4.1, http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/expander/) for data analysis. . Global normalization of gene expression data was performed using the quantile normalization method embedded in the Expander software. The standard deviations of log data and the p-values were calculated using default settings in the Avadis software. Transcriptome analysis was carried out using three biological replicates for uninfected samples (uninfected L929 cells) and five biological replicates for infected samples (L929 cells infected with O. tsutsugamushi for 48 h).

We previously produced a line of transgenic mice (Tg) on a mixed genetic background where cardiac-specific overexpression of Cre recombinase reduced expression of the EP4 receptor gene. There were no obvious phenotypes in 10-12-week-old male Tg mice. To determine if a cardiac phenotype developed in aged mice, we assessed cardiac structure and function by echocardiography, histology and gene expression in 23-33-week-old male Tg and littermates (Cont). After echocardiography, hearts were removed to assess hypertrophy (MCSA), fibrosis (ICF) and macrophage infiltration by histological methods and for extraction of total RNA and protein. Cont mice had a normal EF of 80  0.6% (n=70), whereas Tg mice had a lower EF (60  2.7%, n=55, p<0.001) coupled with left ventricular dilatation. The distribution of EFs in the Tg mice was large, ranging from normal to below 30%.  MCSA and infiltrating macrophages were not different between groups, but ICF increased by 35% in Tg mice. Cre protein levels in heart lysates did not correlate with either age or EF. In contrast to male Tg mice, female Tg mice had no cardiac dysfunction assessed by echocardiography from 12 to 28 weeks of age. To understand gene expression differences between Cont and Tg mice, whole genome gene expression profiling (Illumina BeadChips) on hearts of 30-32 week old male mice was done. Data indicated that 595 genes were overexpressed in the Tg hearts, 156 of which changed more than 2-fold, including genes involved in remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. 512 genes were downregulated in the Cont hearts, 79 of which changed more than 2-fold, including genes involved with calcium handling, K+ channels, and fatty acid transport and metabolism. In conclusion, Cre overexpression and EP4 knock down in cardiac myocytes in aged male but not female Tg mice are in part associated with increased fibrosis, reduced EF and dilated cardiomyopathy; however, Cre protein itself does not seem to be responsible for the cardiomyopathy. The absence of cardiac dysfunction in female mice suggests a sexual dimorphism in the phenotype.

We previously found that NF-kB induces transcription of bfl-1, and that the Bfl-1 protein is also regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome. However little is known of the role that dysregulation of Bfl-1 turnover plays in cancer. We found that ubiquitination-resistant mutants of Bfl-1 display increased stability and greatly accelerate tumor formation in a mouse model of leukemia/lymphoma. Gene expression profiling revealed that tyrosine kinase Lck is highly upregulated and activated in these tumors compared to the parental cells, as were several genes in the RANK signaling pathway, and leads to activation of the IKK, Akt and Erk signaling pathways, which are key mediators in cancer. Tumor assays with cells coexpressing constitutively active Lck with Bfl-1, or with tumor-derived cells following shRNA-mediated Lck knockdown, unveiled functional cooperation between Bfl-1 and Lck in leukemia/lymphomagenesis. These data demonstrate that ubiquitination is a critical mechanism for regulating Bfl-1 function, and suggest that mutations in bfl-1 or in the signaling pathways that control its ubiquitination may predispose to cancer. Additionally since bfl-1 is upregulated in many human hematopoietic tumors, these data suggest that strategies to promote Bfl-1 ubiquitination may improve therapy in drug-resistant tumors.

CD62Lhi PSGL1hi, CD62Llo PSGL1hi, and CD62Llo PSGL1lo CD4+ T cells were isolated directly ex vivo. There was no treatment given to the animals. Naive (CD62Lhi CD44lo) CD4+ B220- T cells were isolated from young 6-8 week old female mice for comparison. We used a microarray to identify unique features of the CD62Llo PSGL1lo population in comparison to na  ve CD4+ T cells and other activated CD4+ T cells. Cells were isolated from the spleens of aged (16-24 weeks) female MRL/Faslpr mice directy ex vivo, and immediatley sorted into 3 populations; CD62Lhi PSGL1hi, CD62Llo PSGL1hi, and CD62Llo PSGL1lo.

Other non-immunological functions of Treg cells, such as controlling metabolic function in adipose tissue, are also emerging. Treg cells originate primarily in the thymus, but can also be elicited from conventional T cells by in vivo exposure to low-dose antigen or homeostatic expansion, or by activation in the presence of TGF   in vitro. Treg cells are characterized by a distinct transcriptional signature controlled in part, but not solely, by FoxP3. For a better perspective on transcriptional control in Treg cells, we compared gene expression profiles of a broad panel of Treg cells from various origins or anatomical locations. Treg cells generated by different means form different sub-phenotypes identifiable by particular combinations of transcripts, none of which fully encompass the entire Treg signature. Molecules involved in Treg effector function, chemokine receptors, and the transcription factors that control them are differentially represented in these subphenotypes. Treg cells from the gut proved dissimilar to cells elicited by exposure to TGF  , but instead they resembled a CD103+Klrg1+ subphenotype preferentially generated in response to lymphopenia. All gene expression profiles were obtained from highly purified T cell populations sorted by flow cytometry. To reduce variability, cells from multiple mice were pooled for sorting, and replicates or triplicates were generated for all groups. RNA from 1-5 x 104 cells was amplified, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix M430v2 microarrays.

In addition to transcriptional regulation, post-translational regulation may also control HSC differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we visualized ubiquitin-regulated protein stability of a single transcription factor, c-Myc. The stability of c-Myc protein was instructive of HSC quiescence and c-Myc protein abundance was controlled by the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7. Fine changes in stability of c-Myc protein regulated the HSC    gene expression signature   . Using whole genome genomic approaches, we identified specific regulators of HSC function that are directly controlled by c-Myc binding, however adult HSCs and embryonic stem cells sense and interpret distinctly c-Myc regulated gene expression.

We have previously shown that some lactobacilli strains induce a strong production of the pro-inflammatory and Th1 polarizing cytokine IL-12 in DC. Contrary, bifidobacteria do not induce IL-12, but are able to inhibit the IL-12 production induced by lactobacilli. In the present study, genome wide microarrays were used to investigate the maturation and gene expression pattern murine bone marrow derived DC stimulated with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium bifidum Z9. L. acidophilus NCFM strongly induced expression of interferon (IFN)-  , multiple virus defence genes, and cytokine and chemokine genes related to both the adaptive and the innate immune response. Contrary, B. bifidum Z9 mostly up-regulated genes encoding cytokines and chemokines related to the innate immune response. Moreover, B. bifidum Z9 inhibited the expression of the genes initiating the adaptive immune response induced by L. acidophilus NCFM and had an additive effect on genes of the innate immune response and some Th2 skewing genes. The gene encoding Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2), a key regulator in cell signalling, was one of the few genes only induced by B. bifidum Z9. Blocking of the JNK1/2 pathway completely inhibited the gene expression of Ifn-  . We suggest that B. bifidum Z9 employs an active mechanism to inhibit induction of genes in DC triggering the adaptive immune system and that JPD2 is involved in the regulatory mechanism.

The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist and a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, reportedly has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity.  We studied the effects of telmisartan on the adipose tissue macrophage phenotype in high fat-fed mice.  Telmisartan was administered for 5 weeks to high fat-fed C57BL/6 mice.  Insulin sensitivity, macrophage infiltration, and the gene expressions of M1 and M2 markers in epididymal fat tissues were examined.  Insulin- or a glucose-tolerance test showed that telmisartan treatment improved insulin resistance, decreasing the body weight gain, visceral fat weight and adipocyte size without affecting the amount of food intake.  Telmisartan treatment reduced the number of CD11c-positive cells and crown-like structures.  Telmisartan reduced the mRNA expressions of M1 macrophage markers, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased the expression of M2 markers, such as IL-10 and Mgl2.  The reduction of M1 macrophage markers, as well as the increased gene expression of M2 markers especially IL-10, is a possible mechanism for the improvement of insulin sensitivity by telmisartan. Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from CLEA Japan.  The mice were fed a chow that contained 10% of its calories from fat (control) or a high-fat diet (HFD) that contained 30% of its calories from fat for 24 weeks.  The high fat-fed mice were randomized to 3 groups.  Either telmisartan (~3 mg/kg/day) in drinking water (HFD+Tel), candesartan (~3 mg/kg/day) in drinking water (HFD+Can), or a HFD without any drugs (HFD) was administered for the next 5 weeks.  Two mice were treated per group. Epididymal adipose tissues were rapidly removed from each mouse.  Gene expression in epididymal fat tissue was analyzed using a GeneChip   system with the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array, which was spotted with 45,101 probe sets (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).  Sample preparation for the array hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer   s instructions.

The scanned chip was analyzed using the GeneChip Analysis Suite software (Affymetrix).  Hybridization intensity data were converted into a presence/absence call for each gene, and changes in gene expression between experiments were detected by a comparison analysis.

In vitro differentiated CD8+ T cells have been the primary focus of immunotherapy of cancer with little focus on CD4+ T cells. Immunotherapy involving in vitro differentiated T cells given after lymphodepleting regimens significantly augments antitumor immunity in animals and human patients with cancer. However, the mechanisms by which lymphopenia augments adoptive cell therapy and the means of properly differentiating T cells in vitro are still emerging. We demonstrate that na  ve tumor/self-specific CD4+ T cells naturally differentiated into T helper type 1 (Th1) cytotoxic T cells in vivo and caused the regression of established tumors and depigmentation in lymphopenic hosts.

A common feature of demyelinated lesions is the presence of oligodendrocyte precursors (OLPs) blocked at a premyelinating stage. However, the mechanistic basis for inhibition of myelin repair is incompletely understood. To identify novel regulators of OLP differentiation, potentially dysregulated during repair, we performed a genome-wide screen of 1040 transcription factor-encoding genes expressed in remyelinating rodent lesions. We report that    50 transcription factor-encoding genes show dynamic expression during repair and that expression of the Wnt pathway mediator Tcf4 (aka Tcf7l2) within OLPs is specific to lesioned   but not normal   adult white matter. We report that   -catenin signaling is active during oligodendrocyte development and remyelination in vivo. Moreover, we observed similar regulation of Tcf4 in the developing human CNS and lesions of MS. Data mining revealed elevated levels of Wnt pathway mRNA transcripts and proteins within MS lesions, indicating activation of the pathway in this pathological context. We show that dysregulation of Wnt     -catenin signaling in OLPs results in profound delay of both developmental myelination and remyelination, based on (1) conditional activation of   -catenin in the oligodendrocyte lineage in vivo and (2) findings from APCMin mice, which lack one functional copy of the endogenous Wnt pathway inhibitor APC. Together, our findings indicate that dysregulated Wnt     -catenin signaling inhibits myelination/remyelination in the mammalian CNS. Evidence of Wnt pathway activity in human MS lesions suggests that its dysregulation might contribute to inefficient myelin repair in human neurological disorders. 12 samples total. Two variables in the experiment: genotype (wild type or Olig2cre/DA-Cat) and Developmental stage (Day 4 or Day 15). 4 phenotypes in total with 3 biological replicates for each phenotype. ..

Having exposed the spinal vertebrae at the level of T12/T13, tissue was cleared overlying the intervertebral space, and the dura was pierced with a dental needle just lateral to midline. A Hamilton needle was advanced through the pierced dura at an angle of 45? and 0.5 ?L of 1% lysolecithin (L-?-lysophosphatidylcholine) was injected into the ventrolateral white matter. Unlesioned spinal cords or 14-dpl lesioned cords were removed fresh and snap-frozen in iso-pentane and stored at ?80?C.

Here, we investigated the extent of their similarity using a microarray approach. Approximately 300 genes in human and 550 genes in mouse were differentially expressed between subsets. More than 130 of these gene expression differences were conserved between mouse and human monocyte subsets. We confirmed numerous differences at the cell surface protein level. Despite overall conservation, some molecules were conversely expressed between the two species    subsets, including CD36, CD9, and TREM-1. Furthermore, other differences existed, including a prominent PPAR   signature in mouse monocytes absent in human. Overall, human and mouse monocyte subsets are far more broadly conserved than currently recognized. Thus, studies in mice may indeed yield relevant information regarding the biology of human monocyte subsets. However, differences between the species deserve consideration in models of human disease studied in the mouse. The two major subsets of monocytes (Ly-6C+ and Ly-6Clo) from 12-week old C57Bl/6 mice were sorted and the RNA extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip   430 2.0 arrays.

Here we show that FoxO3, a member of a transcription factor family known to extend lifespan in invertebrates, regulates the NSC pool. We find that adult FoxO3-/- mice have fewer NSC in vivo than wild type counterparts. NSC isolated from adult FoxO3-/- mice have decreased self-renewal and an impaired ability to generate different neural lineages. Identification of the FoxO3-dependent gene expression profile in NSC suggests that FoxO3 regulates the NSC pool by inducing a program of genes that preserves quiescence, prevents premature differentiation, and controls oxygen metabolism. The ability of FoxO3 to prevent the premature depletion of NSC might have important implications for counteracting brain aging in long-lived species. mRNA expression from secondary neurospheres cultured from cells taken from mouse forebrains was compared between FoxO3+/+ (wildtype) and FoxO3-/- (null mutant) mice from the FVB/N background. .. total RNA;  FoxO3 null mutant;  wild type;  FVB/N;  10090;  Mus musculus;  forebrain;  NSC from neurospheres were enzymatically dissociated for 5-10 minutes at 37?C with Accutase (Chemicon), then mechanically dissociated and seeded at a density of 5x104 cells/ml.;

This allowed us to sub-fractionate common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and pre-pro-B cells into lamda5-Rag1low, lamda5-Rag1high and lamda5+Rag1high cells. Clonal in vitro differentiation analysis demonstrated that Rag1low cells gave rise to B/T and NK cells. Rag1high cells displayed reduced NK-cell potential with preserved capacity to generate B- and T-lineage cells while the lamda5+ cells were B-lineage restricted. Ebf1 and Pax5 expression was largely confined to the Rag1high populations. These cells also expressed a higher level of the surface protein LY6D providing an additional tool for the analysis of early lymphoid development. These data suggest that the classical CLP compartment composes a mixture of cells with more or less restricted lineage potentials opening new possibilities to investigate early hematopoiesis.

However, the process still remains poorly understood, in large part because of the lack of adequate experimental models. Here we describe a robust cell reprogramming system consisting of a B cell line with an inducible form of C/EBPa that can be converted into macrophages with essentially 100% efficiency in only 2 to 3 days. The conversion involves reciprocal changes in cell surface antigen expression, increase in cell granularity and size, alterations in cellular structures, formation of membrane extensions, acquisition of phagocytic capacity and an increased inflammatory responsiveness as well as migratory activity. Analysis of the transcriptome shows complex reciprocal regulation of B cell and macrophage genes, including transcription factors required for the formation of the two lineages. The fact that the cells become irreversibly committed to a macrophage fate within 1 to 2 days after activation of C/EBPa show that they are truly reprogrammed. The system should be useful to study epigenetic and cell biological mechanisms of transcription factor induced cell reprogramming. time course analysis.6 duplicated conditions: 12 samples.control: HAFTL cellstime points: vehicle control, 3h, 12h, 24h, 48h. ..

Certain lactobacilli species have been shown to possess strong IL-12 inducing properties. As IL-12 production depends on the up-regulation of type I interferons, we hypothesized that the strong IL-12 inducing capacity of  L. acidophilus NCFM in murine bone marrow derived DC is caused by an up-regulation of IFN-  , which subsequently stimulates the induction of IL-12 and the dsRNA binding toll like receptor (TLR)-3. The expression of the genes encoding IFN-  , IL-12, IL-10 and TLR-3 in DC upon stimulation with L. acidophilus NCFM was measured. L. acidophilus NCFM induced a much stronger expression of ifn-  , il-12 and il-10 compared to the synthetic dsRNA ligand Poly I:C, whereas the levels of expressed tlr-3 were similar. By the use of whole genome microarray gene expression, we investigated whether other genes related to the viral defence were up-regulated in DC upon stimulation with L. acidophilus NCFM and found that various virus defence related genes, both early and late, were among the strongest up-regulated genes. The IFN-   stimulating capability was also detected in another L. acidophilus strain, but was not a property of other probiotic bacteria tested (B. bifidum and E. coli nissle).The IFN-   inducing capacity was markedly reduced in TLR-2 -/- DCs, dependent on endocytosis and the major cause of the induction of il-12 and tlr-3 in L. acidophilus NCFM stimulated cells.

Immunoprecipitation (IP) with a FLAG-antibody in Cdx2-induced ES cells, identifies NuRD in CDX2-associated protein complexes; and chromatin-IP-sequencing identifies CDX2-binding sites predominantly in genes up-regulated by CDX2. Compendium analyses of Cdx2- and the other TF-inducible ES cells suggest a central role of the POU5F1/SOX2/NANOG protein complex in a swift-acting control mechanism to down-regulate a common set of genes at the beginning of multi-lineage ES cell differentiations. These ES cell lines will be a valuable resource to study biological networks in ES cells and mice.

Cells were electroporated with linearlized pMWROSATcH and selected by hygromycine B. Knock-in for ROSA-TET locus in ES[MC1R(20)] cells was confirmed by southern blotting. For exchange vectors, PCR amplified ORFs were subcloned into pZhcSfi that was modified to express His6-FLAG tagged protein and puromycin resistant gene. ES[MC1R(20)] cells (passage 17) cultured on feeder cells were co-transfected with sequence verified exchange vector and pCAGGS-Cre and selected by puromycin in the presence of doxycycline. Isolated clones were tested for Venus expression, hygromycin B susceptibility, transgene RNA expression, genotyping for Cre mediated integration, karyotyping, western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and mycoplasma contamination. ES cells (passage 25) were plated onto gelatin-coated dish. Doxycycline was removed through washing 3 times with PBS at 3 hours intervals. Total RNA was isolated by TRIzol (Invitrogen) at time points indicated in the sample names. Cy3-CTP labeled sample targets were prepared with total RNA by Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent). Cy5-CTP labeled reference target was produced from mixture of Stratagene Universal Mouse Reference RNA and MC1 cells RNA. .. mixed;  Embryonic Stem Cells;  embryo;  male;  Ascl1 clone12, Dox+, 24h #2;

The strongest locus (C3Bir-derived cytokine deficiency-induced colitis susceptibility [Cdcs]1 on Chromosome [Chr] 3) controlled multiple colitogenic subphenotypes and contributed the vast majority to the phenotypic variance in cecum and colon. This was demonstrated by interval-specific Chr 3 congenic mice wherein defined regions of Cdcs1 from C3Bir or B6 were bred into the IL-10-deficient reciprocal background and altered the susceptible or resistant phenotype. Furthermore, this locus likely acts by inducing innate hypo- and adaptive hyperresponsiveness, associated with impaired NF  B responses of macrophages. The aim of the present study was to dissect the complexity of Cdcs1 by further development and characterization of reciprocal Cdcs1 congenic strains and to identify potential candidate genes in the congenic interval. Material and Methods: In total, 15 reciprocal congenic strains were generated from Il10-/- mice of either C3H/HeJBir or C57BL/6J backgrounds by 10 cycles of backcrossing. Colitis activity was monitored by histological grading. Candidate genes were identified by fine mapping of congenic intervals, sequencing, microarray analysis and a high-throughput real-time RT-PCR approach using bone marrow-derived macrophages. Results: Within the originally identified Cdcs1-interval, three independent regions were detected that likely contain susceptibility-determining genetic factors (Cdcs1.1, Cdcs1.2, and Cdcs1.3). Combining results of candidate gene approaches revealed Fcgr1, Cnn3, Larp7, and Alpk1 as highly attractive candidate genes with polymorphisms in coding or regulatory regions and expression differences between susceptible and resistant mouse strains. Conclusions: Subcongenic analysis of the major susceptibility locus Cdcs1 on mouse chromosome 3 revealed a complex genetic structure. Candidate gene approaches revealed attractive genes within the identified regions with homologs that are located in human susceptibility regions for IBD. Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) of colitis susceptible C3Bir-Il10-/- and colitis resistant B6-Il10-/- as well as the Il10-/- reciprocal congenic strains CB-R1 (C3Bir genetic background carrying a long congenic chromosome 3 element containing Cdcs1 from B6, rendering this formerly susceptible background resistant) and BC-R3 (B6 genetic background that carries the Cdcs1-region of C3Bir) were cultured and stimulated with flagellin or left unstimulated.   BMDM were obtained from 3 male mice per genotype and cultured in polystyrene 6-well culture plates. Before RNA-isolation, 3 wells per plate were stimulated with Cbir1 flagellin (and subsequently pooled for RNA isolation), the other 3 wells left unstimulated (and also pooled). In total, these experiments were replicated three times in order to perform microarray analyses in triplicates. ..

Though AML is a relatively rare disease, such a high mutability rate, as observed with FLT3 gene, is striking. To elucidate the molecular background of this phenomenon, we have established nine unique FLT3/ITD - carrying 32D cell lines and a set of controls, and subjected them to whole genome expression analysis and 2DE LC/MS proteomics. Data obtained on this so far largest set of ITD mutants indicates that in comparison to the wild type FLT3 expressing 32D cells and transduction controls, FLT3/ITD positive cells exhibit less mature expression profiles resembling ST-HSC and MkEP/CMP/LMPP progenitors. We hypothesize that FLT3/ITD might contribute not only to the proliferative advantage of FLT3/ITD positive cells, but also to their reprogramming towards less differentiated stages, thus strengthening their malignant properties. This finding might explain the pronounced mutation rate of the aberrantly expressed FLT3 gene in AML, and, also, the inferior prognosis of FLT3/ITD positive AML patients. Moreover, the microarray data has revealed biological differences among individual ITD variants     a finding supporting the recent clinical data on the prognostic impact of the size of individual ITDs.

However, pathogens generally have multiple ligands, making it difficult to dissect the roles of individual receptors in these processes. Here, we used latex beads coupled to single ligands, focusing on IgG, mannan, LPS and avidin, and monitored phagocytic uptake rates, phago-lysosomal fusion events, macrophage gene expression and the proteomic composition of isolated phagosomes. The pattern of gene expression and the protein composition of isolated phagosomes showed that each bead ligand altered a distinct pattern of genes and led to a different composition of phagosomes. These data argue that activation of each receptor initiates a specific signature of signaling events that last many hours and influences several phagocytosis functions. All samples and controls were carried out in triplicates. J774.A1 cells (mouse macrophage-like cell line) were seeded onto 6-well plates one day before the experiment. Subsequently, cells were incubated with serum-free DME medium containing 0.01 % latex beads of 1   m diameter coupled to the following ligands: avidin (Av), the Fc fragment of mouse IgG (Fc), lipopolysaccharides from Klebsiella pneumoniae (LPS) and mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisae (Man) for 30 and 60 minutes.

Compared to the mAHRb allele, the hAHR displays 10-fold lower relative affinity for prototypical ligands such as 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). However, in previous studies we have demonstrated that the hAHR can display a higher relative ligand binding affinity than the mAHRb for specific AHR ligands such as indirubin. Each receptor has also been shown to differentially recruit LXXLL co-activator-motif proteins and to utilize different TAD subdomains in gene transactivation. Using hepatocytes isolated from C57BL6/J mice (Ahrb/b) and AHRTtr transgenic mice which express hAHR protein specifically in hepatocytes, we investigated whether the hAHR and mAHRb differentially regulate genes. Microarray and quantitative-PCR analysis of Ahrb/b and AHRTtr primary-mouse hepatocytes treated with 10 nM TCDD revealed that a number of established AHR target genes such as Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 are significantly induced by both receptors. Remarkably, of the 1752 genes induced by mAHRb and 1186 genes induced by hAHR, only 265 genes (<10%) were significantly activated by both receptors in response to TCDD. Conversely of the 1100 and 779 genes significantly repressed in mAHRb and hAHR hepatocytes respectively, only 462 (<25%) genes were significantly repressed by both receptors in response to TCDD treatment. Genes identified as differentially expressed are known to be involved in a number of biological pathways, including cell proliferation and inflammatory response which suggests that compared to the mAHRb, the hAHR may play contrasting roles in TCDD-induced toxicity and endogenous AHR-mediated gene regulation.  Isolated mouse hepatocytes from wild type and treated with 10nM TCDD for 6h were analyzed. 1 array per mouse (3 mice per treatment group) was used.GeneChip   Operating Software (Affymetrix) was utilized to preprocess CAB/CEL files generated from the 12 scanned microarrays which represented hepatocytes isolated from one mouse each.

Treg cells also suppress a variety of other immune responses, including anti-tumor and alloimmune responses.  We have previously reported that tumor-activated Treg cells express granzyme B and that granzyme B is important for Treg cell-mediated suppression of anti-tumor immune responses (GSE13409).  Here, we report that allogeneic mismatch also induces the expression of granzyme B.  Granzyme B-deficient mice challenged with fully mismatched allogeneic P815 mastocytoma cells have markedly improved survival compared to WT and other granzyme- or perforin-deficient mice, suggesting an immunoregulatory role for granzyme B in this setting.  Treg cells harvested from the tumor environment of P815-challenged mice express granzyme B.  Treg cells also express granzyme B in vitro during mixed lymphocyte reactions and in vivo in a mouse model of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  However, in contrast to findings from our previously published tumor model, granzyme B is not required for the suppression of effector T cell (Teff) proliferation in in vitro Treg suppression assays stimulated by either Concanavalin A or allogeneic antigen presenting cells.  Additionally, in an ex vivo assay, sort-purified in vivo-activated CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells from mice with active GVHD -- under conditions known to induce granzyme B expression in Treg cells -- suppressed Teff cell proliferation in a granzyme B-independent manner.  Adoptive transfer of naive granzyme B-deficient CD4+CD25+ Treg cells into a mouse model of GVHD rescued hosts from lethatlity equivalently to naive wild-type Treg cells.  Serum analysis of GVHD-associated cytokine production in these recipients also demonstrated that Treg cells suppressed production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, and IFN-gamma in a granzyme B-independent manner.  In order to determine whether the context in which Treg cells are activated alters the intrinsic properties of Treg cells, we used Foxp3 reporter mice to obtain gene expression profiles of CD4+Foxp3+ Treg cells purifed from naive resting spleens, spleens from mice with acute GVHD, and from ascites fluid of mice challenged intraperitoneally with allogeneic P815 tumor cells.  Unsupervised analyses revealed distinct activation signatures of Treg cells among the 3 experimental groups.  Taken together, these findings demonstrate that granzyme B is not required for Treg cell-mediated suppression of GVHD, which is in contrast to what we have previously reported for Treg cell function in the setting of tumor challenge.  Cell intrinsic differences could partially account for these differential phenotypes.  These data also suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting specific Treg cell suppressive functions in order to segregate GVHD and graft-versus-tumor effector functions.

Embryos exposed to alcohol in controlled environment to assess teratogenic effects. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a leading developmental disorder. To date,  a holistic view of molecular gene changes is largely unexplored. Using microarray analysis of whole embryo mouse culture with strict-control over alcohol-level, we found, directly related alcohol-metabolism, a reduction of retinol binding protein 1(Rbp1), and a, de novo expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1).  Remarkably, four key hemopoiesis genes (glycophorin A, adducin 2, beta-2 microglobulin, and ceruloplasmin) became absent, and many histone variants genes were reduced.  Hypothesis-driven informatics analysis and intersection analysis of two independent experiments indicated that the altered genes are involved in cell growth, hemopoiesis, histone modification, eye and heart development, and a collective reduction in expression of growth factor genes (Igf1, Efemp1, Tieg, and Edil3) and neural specification genes (neurogenin, Sox 5, bHLHb5).  Down-regulated neural specification phenotypes further supported the above findings.  Further more, the gene expression profile indicated distinct subgroups which overlapped with the teratogenesis of the open- and the closed-neural tubes known in FAS.  In summary, our data reveal genes alteration with causal potential for dysmorpology (e.g. retinoic acid, neuronal specification, and neurotrophic factors, and epigenetics related histone genes) and those downstream responsive genes related to alcohol metabolism, and developmental teratogenesis.

Having discovered a novel inhibitory pathway triggered by ligation of DC-HIL on APC to a heparin/heparan sulfate-like saccharide of syndecan-4 on activated T cells, we posited DC-HIL can recognize microbial pathogens in a similar manner.  We showed soluble recombinant DC-HIL to bind the dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum audouinii, but not several bacteria nor Candida albicans.  Dermatophyte binding was inhibited completely by the addition of heparin.  Because DC-HIL contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like intracellular sequence, we questioned whether its binding to dermatophytes can induce tyrosine phosphorylation in dendritic cells (DC).  Culturing DC with T. rubrum (but not with C. albicans pseudohyphae) induced phosphorylation of DC-HIL, but not when the tyrosine residue of the ITAM-like sequence was mutated to phenylalanine.  To examine the functional significance of such signaling on DC, we cross-linked DC-HIL with mAb (surrogate ligand), which not only induced tyrosine phosphorylation but also upregulated expression of 23 genes among 662 genes analyzed by gene-array, including genes for profilin-1, Marcksl-1, C/EBP, LOX-1, IL-beta and TNF-alpha.  This cross-linking also upregulated expression of the activation markers CD80/CD86 and heightened APC capacity of DC to activate syngeneic T cells.  Our findings support a dual role for DC-HIL; inhibition of adaptive immunity following ligation of syndecan-4 on activated T cells, and induction of innate immunity against dermatophytic fungi.

We sought to directly test this hypothesis through gene expression profiling of total lung RNA isolated from mouse models of selective epithelial cell injury that are associated with either productive or abortive repair. Analysis of gene expression in repairing lungs of naphthalene-exposed mice revealed prominent clusters of up-regulated genes with putative roles in regulation of the extracellular matrix and cellular proliferation. Further analysis of tenascin C (Tnc), a representative matrix protein, in total lung RNA revealed a transient 4.5-fold increase in mRNA abundance 1 day after injury and a return to steady-state levels by Recovery Day 3. Tnc was deposited by the peribronchiolar mesenchyme immediately after injury and was remodeled to basement membrane subtending the bronchiolar epithelium during epithelial repair. Epithelial restitution was accompanied by a decrease in Tnc mRNA and protein expression to steady-state levels. In contrast, abortive repair using a transgenic model allowing ablation of all reparative cells led to a progressive increase in Tnc mRNA within lung tissue and accumulation of its gene product within the subepithelial mesenchyme of both conducting airways and alveoli. These data demonstrate that the ECM is dynamically remodeled in response to selective epithelial cell injury and that this process is activated without resolution in the setting of defective airway epithelial repair. Bronchiolar Clara cells undergo phenotypic changes during development and in disease. These changes are poorly described due to a paucity of molecular markers. We used chemical and transgenic approaches to ablate Clara cells, allowing identification of their unique gene expression profile. Flavin monooxygenase 3 (Fmo3), paraoxonase 1 (Pon1), aldehyde oxidase 3 (Aox3), and claudin 10 (Cldn10) were identified as novel Clara cell markers. New and existing Clara cell marker genes were categorized into three classes based on their unique developmental expression pattern. Cldn10 was uniformly expressed in the epithelium at Embryonic Day (E)14.5 and became restricted to secretory cells at E18.5. This transition was defined by induction of Clara Cell Secretory Protein (CCSP). Maturation of secretory cells was associated with progressive increases in the expression of Fmo3, Pon1, Aox3, and Cyp2f2 between late embryonic and postnatal periods. Messenger RNA abundance of all categories of genes was dramatically decreased after naphthalene-induced airway injury, and displayed a sequence of temporal induction during repair that suggested sequential secretory cell maturation. We have defined a broader repertoire of Clara cell-specific genes that allows staging of epithelial maturation during development and repair. 32 samples were isolated and used to screen UniSet Mouse 20K I Bioarrays (total lung RNA Mus musculus). Control RNA was isolated from uninjured mice (N = 4 mice), and RNA was also isolated from mice exposed to naphthalene and recovered for 1, 2, 3, and 6 days (N = 4 mice per timepoint).

Recent studies have demonstrated that ammonium adversely affects glycosylation-related gene expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.  However, since the CHO cell line species has not been fully sequenced, a glycosylation transcriptome analysis is not possible in this cell line.  Therefore, to further understand the effects of ammonium on glycosylation-related gene expression, NS0 cells, a mouse myeloma cell line, were cultured under elevated ammonium.  NS0 cells are similar to CHO cells, in that the NS0 cells are anchorage-independent and commonly used to commercially produce recombinant proteins. Additionally, DNA microarrays containing all known mouse glycosylation-related genes were available to be used to examine gene expression. NS0 cells were cultured under normal (control), elevated ammonium, elevated salt, and elevated ammonium with proline.  It was observed that the control and treatments culture growth rates were not significantly different; however, the final cell densities were significantly different.  The DNA microarray data was analyzed using a Welch ANOVA test with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction for the multiple comparisons of the glycosylation-genes.  No significant difference in gene expression levels between the four conditions examined were observed. The results of this study demonstrated that NS0 cells, at the gene expression level, are insensitive to ammonium. Thus, the decreased glycosylation observed in NS0 cell cultures at elevated ammonium is likely due to changes in synthesis and degradation enzyme activity.  In contrast, CHO cells have decreased glycosylation levels due to decreased sialytransferase gene expression and not increased degradation enzyme activity. Therefore, even though NS0 and CHO cells are both commonly used recombinant hosts for glycoprotein synthesis, it appears that NS0 and CHO cells had different control mechanisms respect to glycosylation-related gene expression under elevated ammonium. NS0 cells (ECACC#85110503), originally from the European Collection of Cell Culture, were donated to Clemson University by Merck, Inc. NS0 cells are a mouse myeloma cell line with lymphoblast morphology, non-secreting clone, and cholesterol auxotroph.  NS0 cells cultured under four conditions were examined:  Control (C), Ammonium-Stressed (A), Salt-Stressed (S), and Ammonium-Stressed with Proline added to mitigate the negative effects of ammonium (P).  Triplicates of each condition were used.  The cultures were be monitored during the normal batch growth phase.  To identify genes sensitive to ammonium in growing cultures, the 90-h time point was selected for RNA isolation and gene expression analysis.  Other culture parameters that were monitored include:  Cell density, viability, and glucose. ..

As a result, 271 genes were upregulated in C2C12 stably expressing shRNA-Rp58 cells compared with control C2C12 cells.

Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes. To investigate the molecular control of hair follicle cycling, we profiled mRNA expression in mouse dorsal skin at multiple representative time points in the synchronized second postnatal hair growth cycle and in a depilation-induced hair growth cycle. For profiling of second synchronized and depilation-induced hair growth cycle, the same upper-mid region of dorsal skin was excised from C57BL/6 mice at representative postnatal days (P). The time points for second hair growth cycle are classified into different phases of the hair growth cycle based on established morphological guidelines as follow: early anagen (P23, P25), mid anagen (P27), late anagen (P29, P34), early catagen (P37, P39), mid catagen (P41), and telogen (P44). Depilation-induced hair growth cycle by applying wax/rosin mixture on the dorsal skin of seven-week old mice (all follicles in telogen) was performed on mice.

Both IFN-   and IFN-   exert their activity through a common receptor IFNAR. Type I Interferons have broad regulatory effects and various subtypes of dendritic cells are influenced by this cytokines. In our study we asked question whether the low, constitutive levels of type I Interferons produced under steady state conditions are important for proper function of splenic conventional dendritic cells. In this approach we sorted out two populations (CD8  + and CD8  -) of splenic dendritic cells (DCs) from untreated WT, IFN-  -/- and IFNAR-/- C57Bl/6 mice. All mice were between 8-10 weeks old. Further we isolated RNA and performed microarray analysis.

Objective: In this study we aimed to identify new genes, gene groups and pathways involved in the pathogenesis of experimental asthma.  Methods: In an ovalbumin-induced murine model of asthma we applied microarray gene expression analysis of the lung at different time points in the asthmatic process. Advanced statistical methods were used to relate gene expression changes to cellular processes and to integrate our results into multiple levels of information available in public databases.  Results: According to the observed marked neutrophil infiltration found early, at 4 hours after the first allergen challenge, gene expression pattern reflected mainly an acute inflammatory response and strong chemotactic activity. At 24 hours after the third allergen challenge, gene set enrichment analysis revealed significant overrepresentation of gene sets corresponding to Th2 type inflammation models. Among the top downregulated transcripts, an antioxidant enzyme, paraoxonase-1 (PON1) was identified. Reduced PON1 protein expression in the lung was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. In human asthmatic patients we found that serum PON1 activity was reduced at exacerbation, but increased parallel with improving asthma symptoms. PON1 gene polymorphisms did not influence the susceptibility to the disease. Conclusion: Our observations suggest that an altered PON1 activity might be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, and PON1 might be a potential new therapeutic target as well as a new diagnostic tool for following up the effect of therapy. Experimental design:Three groups of mice (6 mice/group) were sensitized and challenged with allergen (OVA), one group (control group) was sensitized and challenged with placebo (PBS) and served as a control. On day 28 and 30, 4 h after the first and third allergen challenge, mice in groups 1 and 2 were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine, BAL was isolated and the lungs were removed for further analysis. On day 31, 24h after the third (last) allergen challenge mice in group 3 and the controls were anaesthetized, and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) was assessed. After the AHR measurements, BAL sampling and lung tissue collection were performed, the same way as it was carried out in groups 1 and 2. Cellular composition of BAL, and lung histology were examined in all mice in all groups. AHR was measured in controls and group 3 on day 31. 1000 ng-1000 ng quality-checked total lung tissue RNA samples from OVA sensitized and challenged mice from group 1, 2 and 3 were identically labeled with Cy5 dye, while lung tissue RNA samples from group 4 (control, placebo sensitized and challenged) were pooled and labeled with Cy3 dye, and served as a common reference. ..

TLR4 is the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dsRNA viral mimic poly(I:C) binds to TLR3, and bacterial CpG DNA signals through TLR9.  TLR4 signaling is mediated by adaptor molecules Myd88 and TRIF while TLR3 pathway involves only the TRIF adaptor and TLR9 signals solely through Myd88.      Methods:  To identify genes other than those in TLR pathways that mediate macrophage response to different PAMPs, RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS, poly(I:C), or CpG DNA, and RNA was profiled on microarrays 6 hrs and 24 hrs post-treatment.  Gene expression data were analyzed to determine genes, pathways and transcriptional networks that are in common and unique to each of the three TLR stimuli.  Potentially novel candidates revealed by this analysis were tested for their role in innate immunity using RNA interference.    Results:  Many genes are differentially regulated by LPS and poly(I:C) at both 6 hrs and 24 hrs following treatment, while CpG DNA elicits a much less pronounced transcriptional response.  By analyzing gene expression data for networks and pathways, we prioritized differentially expressed genes that are in common to all three PAMPs as well as those shared by LPS and poly(I:C).  Knockdown by RNA interference of two genes, Plec1 and TPST1, inhibited production of IL-6 in response to LPS in cultured macrophages.      Conclusions:  We have identified novel innate immunity genes that may be important in macrophage response to LPS, poly(I:C), and CpG DNA stimuli.  Our results provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that should be further investigated in mice and human populations. For each treatment (LPS, polyIC, CpG DNA, media only), three biological replicates (separate macrophage cultures and RNA isolations) were profiled.

Methods: To identify novel regulators of the host response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 11 inbred murine strains were challenged with LPS systemically.  RNA from lung, liver, and spleen tissue was profiled on oligonucleotide microarrays to determine if unique transcripts differentiate susceptible and resistant strains of mice.  Gene expression data were analyzed to identify over-represented pathways and transcription factors (TFs).  The role of several TFs in innate immune response to LPS was examined by RNA interference in a mouse macrophage cell line.  Mouse lines with targeted mutations were utilized to further confirm involvement of two novel genes in innate immunity. Results: In addition to two strains lacking functional TLR4 (C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6JTLR4-/-), three murine strains with functional TLR4 (C57BL/6, 129/SvlmJ, and NZW/LacJ) were found to be resistant to systemic LPS challenge; the other six strains were classified as sensitive.  Gene expression analysis supports the involvement of a number of previously identified genes, molecular pathways, and TFs in the host response to LPS but also identifies Hedgehog signaling as a novel pathway activated by LPS.  B6;129Ptch1+/+ wild-type mice were shown to be more sensitive to systemic LPS than B6;129Ptch1+/- heterozygote littermates further supporting the role of Hedgehog signaling in systemic LPS response.  RNA interference-mediated inhibition of 6 TFs (C/EBP, Cdx-2, E2F1, Hoxa4, Nhlh1, and Tead2), out of 15 tested, was found to diminish production of IL-6 and TNFalpha protein in murine macrophages.  The role of E2F1 was confirmed by showing that B6;129E2F1-/- knockout mice are more sensitive to systemic LPS than wild-type controls. Conclusions: Our analysis of gene expression data identified novel pathways and transcription factors that regulate the host response to systemic LPS.  Our results provide potential sepsis biomarkers and therapeutic targets that should be further investigated in human populations.

The mannose receptor (MR), an endocytic receptor expressed on a variety of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), has been demonstrated to target soluble antigens exclusively towards cross-presentation. In this study, we investigated the role of the murine nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor    (PPAR  ), a ligand-activated transcription factor with immunomodulatory properties, in MR-mediated endocytosis and cross-presentation of the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA). We could demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that activation of PPAR   resulted in increased MR expression, which in consequence led to enhanced MR-mediated endocytosis and elevated cross-presentation of soluble OVA. Concomitantly, activation of PPAR   in DCs induced up-regulation of the co-inhibitory molecule B7H1, which, despite enhanced cross-presentation, caused an impaired activation of naive OVA-specific CD8+ T cells and the induction of T cell tolerance. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the immunomodulatory action of PPAR   which might open new possibilities in development of therapeutical approaches aimed at the control of excessive immune responses, e.g. in T cell-mediated autoimmunity.

They interact with microbes through germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize molecular patterns expressed by various microorganisms. Upon antigen binding, PRRs instruct DCs for the appropriate priming of natural killer cells, followed by specific T-cell responses. Once completed the effector phase, DCs reach the terminal differentiation stage and eventually die by apoptosis. We have observed that following lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation the initiation of the apoptotic pathway in DCs is due the activation of NFAT proteins. Indeed, LPS induces Src-family kinase and phospholipase C (PLC)  2 activation, influx of extracellular Ca2+ and calcineurin-dependent nuclear NFAT translocation. The initiation of this pathway is independent of TLR4 engagement, and dependent exclusively on CD14. According with this observation CD14-deficient DCs do not die following LPS stimulation. Nevertheless, CD14-deficient DC death following LPS activation can be restored by co-stimulating DCs with LPS and thapsigargin. Thapsigargin empties the intracellular calcium stores by blocking calcium pumping into the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum and thereby activates plasma membrane calcium channels. This, in turn, allows an influx of calcium into the cytosol and NFAT activation. To identify the NFAT controlled apoptosis genes in LPS activated DCs we have performed a kinetic microarray analysis (0, 48 and 60 h) in conditions allowing or inhibiting NFAT activation. Four genes have been selected: Nur77, Gadd45g, Ddit3/Gadd153/Chop-10 and Tia1. To identify apoptosis genes selectively modulated by NFAT, a comparative kinetic (time points 0, 48 and 60 h) microarray analysis was performed in the following conditions: 1) wild type bone marrow derived DCs (wtBMDCs) stimulated with LPS; 2) CD14-deficient BMDCs stimulated with LPS; 3) wtBMDCs stimulated with LPS in presence of thapsigargin; 4) CD14-deficient BMDCs stimulated with LPS in presence of thapsigargin. .. 6-8 weeks;;  total RNA;  bone marrow derived dendritic cells;  C57BL/6;;  Cd14-/- C57BL/6;;  10090;  Mus musculus;  bone marrow derived dendritic cells;  DCs were resuspended in complete IMDM, plated in 10 ml plates (5 million cells/plate) and harvested 24 hours later.;  DCs were resuspended in complete IMDM, plated in 10 ml plates (5 million cells/plate) and stimulated with smooth LPS (1 ?g/ml) in presence of thapsigargin (50 nM) .

ERBB2 amplification and overexpression have been found in a number of human cancers, including breast, ovary and kidney carcinoma. Our aim was to detect ERBB2- regulated target genes that contribute to its tumorigenic effect on a genomewide scale. The differential gene expression profile of ERBB2- transfected and wild-type mouse fibroblasts was monitored employing DNA microarrays. Regulated expression of selected genes was verified by RT-PCR and validated by Western blot analysis. Genomewide gene expression profiling identified (i) known targets of ERBB2 signaling, (ii) genes implicated in tumorigenesis but so far not associated with ERBB2 signaling as well as (iii) genes not yet associated with oncogenic transformation, including novel genes without functional annotation. We also found that at least a fraction of coexpressed genes are closely linked on the genome. ERBB2 overexpression suppresses the transcription of antiangiogenic factors (e.g., Sparc, Timp3, Serpinf1) but induces expression of angiogenic factors (e.g., Klf5, Tnfaip2, Sema3c). Profiling of ERBB2-dependent gene regulation revealed a compendium of potential diagnostic markers and putative therapeutic targets. Identification of coexpressed genes that colocalize in the genome may indicate gene regulatory mechanisms that require further study to evaluate functional coregulation.

MuRF2, a closely related family member, redundantly interacts with protein substrates, and hetero-dimerizes with MuRF1. Mice lacking either MuRF1 or MuRF2 are phenotypically normal whereas mice lacking both proteins develop a spontaneous cardiac and skeletal muscle hypertrophy indicating cooperative control of muscle mass by MuRF1 and MuRF2. In order to identify the role that MuRF1 plays in regulating cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, we created transgenic mice expressing increased amounts of cardiac MuRF1. Adult MuRF1 transgenic (Tg+) hearts exhibited a non-progressive thinning of the left ventricular wall and a concomitant decrease in cardiac function. Experimental induction of cardiac hypertrophy by trans-aortic constriction (TAC) induced rapid failure of MuRF1 Tg+ hearts. Microarray analysis identified that the levels of genes associated with metabolism (and in particular mitochondrial processes) were significantly altered in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, both at baseline and during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Surprisingly, ATP levels in MuRF1 Tg+ mice did not differ from wild type mice despite the depressed contractility following TAC. To explain this discrepancy between the ongoing heart failure and maintained ATP levels in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, we compared the level and activity of creatine kinase (CK) between wild type and MuRF1 Tg+ hearts. Although mCK and CK-M/B protein levels were unaffected in MuRF1 Tg+ hearts, total CK activity was significantly inhibited. We conclude that MuRF1   s inhibition of CK activity leads to increased susceptibility to heart failure following TAC, demonstrating for the first time that MuRF1 regulates cardiac energetics in vivo.

Here we identify gene model 98, which we have named Myelin-gene Regulatory Factor (MRF), as a transcriptional regulator required for CNS myelination. Within the CNS, MRF is specifically expressed by postmitotic oligodendrocytes. MRF is a nuclear protein containing an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain homologous to a yeast transcription factor. Knockdown of MRF in oligodendrocytes by RNA interference prevents expression of most CNS myelin genes; conversely, overexpression of MRF within cultured oligodendrocyte progenitors or the chick spinal cord promotes expression of myelin genes. In mice lacking MRF within the oligodendrocyte lineage, pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes are generated but display severe deficits in myelin gene expression and fail to myelinate. These mice display severe neurological abnormalities, and die due to seizures during the third postnatal week. These findings establish MRF as a critical transcriptional regulator essential for oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination. We used microarrays to compare cultured oligodendrocytes (differentiated in vitro for 4 days) from MRF conditional knockouts and control litteramates to look at the effects of MRF deficiency on myelin gene expression. Mouse OPCs grown in vitro in the presence of PDGF serve as a baseline for gene expression prior to differentiation. Mouse OPCs from MRF conditional knockout (MRF fl/fl, Olig2 wt/cre) mice and control littermates (MRF wt/fl; Olig2 wt/cre) were isolated from enzymatically dissociated P7 mouse brains as previously described (Cahoy et al., 2008), positively immunopanning for PDGFR-alpha following a depletion of microglia with BSL1. Cells were grown in defined serum-free media as previously described (Dugas et al., 2006), but with the addition of 2% B-27 (Invitrogen). Cells were proliferated for several days in the presence of PDGF-AA (10 ng/ml, PeproTech) and then differentiation induced by withdrawal of PDGF-AA and addition of triiodothyronine (T3) (40 ng/ml; Sigma). RNA was isolated from cells 4 days after induction of differentiation; OPCs maintained in PDGF-AA serve as a baseline of OPC gene expression. Total RNA was isolated from cells with the RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using Qiagen on-column DNase treatment to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. The integrity of RNA was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Rockland, DE). Biotinylated cRNAs for hybridization to Affymetrix 3'-arrays were prepared from 1ug total RNA using the Affymetrix two-cycle target labeling assay with spike in controls (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, 900494). Labeled-cRNA was fragmented and hybridized to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (3'-arrays, Affymetrix, 900495) following the manufacturer's protocols. Raw image files were processed using Affymetrix GCOS 1.3 software to calculate individual probe cell intensity data and generate CEL data files. Using GCOS and the MAS 5.0 algorithm, intensity data was normalized per chip to a target intensity TGT value of 500 and expression data and present/absent calls for individual probe sets calculated.

The multiple roles of IGF signaling in cancer suggest that selective inhibition of the pathway might yield clinically effective therapeutics. Here we describe A-928605, a novel small molecule inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase responsible for IGF signal transduction. This small molecule is able to abrogate activation of the pathway as shown by effects on the target and downstream effectors and is shown to be effective at inhibiting the proliferation of an oncogene addicted tumor model cell line (CD8-IGF1R 3T3) both in vitro and in vivo.

We have characterized the transcriptome of Itk-deficient CD3+ T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, using Affymetrix microarrays. The largest difference between Itk-/- and Wt CD3+ T-cells was found in unstimulated cells, e.g. for killer cell lectin-like receptors. Compared to anti-CD3-stimulation, anti-CD3/CD28 significantly decreased the number of transcripts suggesting that the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is mainly independent of Itk. The signatures of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets identified a greater differential expression than in total CD3+ cells. Cyclosporin (CsA)-treatment had a stronger effect on transcriptional regulation than Itk-deficiency, suggesting that only a fraction of TCR-mediated calcineurin/NFAT-activation is dependent on Itk. Bioinformatic analysis of NFAT-sites of the group of transcripts similarly regulated by Itk-deficiency and CsA-treatment, followed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation, revealed NFATc1-binding to the Bub1, IL7R, Ctla2a, Ctla2b, and Schlafen1 genes. Finally, to identify transcripts that are regulated by Tec-family kinases in general, we compared the expression profile of Itk-deficient T-cells with that of Btk-deficient B-cells and a common set of transcripts was found. Taken together, our study provides a general overview about the global transcriptional changes in the absence of Itk. CD3+ T-cells from pooled suspensions of spleen and lymph nodes of Wt and Itk knockout mice on C57BL/6 background were isolated after negative depletion. Unstimulated as well as stimulated T-cells were studied. Stimulations were done with anti-CD3 (1 mg/ml) with or without anti-CD28 (3 mg/ml) in the presence or absence of CsA (1 mg/ml) for 24 hrs.

Profiling of Immortalized Melanocyte Cell Lines Identifies GPNMB as a Melanoblast-Expressed, MITF-Dependent Gene|Gene expression profiling of tissues derived from different genetic backgrounds can provide insight to potential phenotype-related changes in gene expression.  We have compared wildtype C57BL/6 (melan-Ink4a) melanocyte cell gene expression to that of,    brown    Tyrp1b/ b (melan-Ink4a-b) and    chocolate    Rab38 cht/cht (melan-cht) melanocyte derived lines. We observed alterations in gene expression consistent with a physiological response of melan-Ink4a-b cells to endoplasmic reticulum protein-folding impairment. Additionally, a set of loci was identified that are expressed in a similar manner to known melanocyte genes. Importantly, the collection of 254 genes is enriched for expression in the multiple melanocyte lines relative to control cell populations. This set contains Tyr, Tyrp1, Dct, Si, Melna, Slc24a5, Slc45a2, Slc24a4, Mitf, and Sox10, in addition to genes not previously attributed to pigmentation and genes with unknown function. Further evaluation of one gene in this cohort, Gpnmb, demonstrated an expression pattern similar to Dct, Si and Mitf. This expression is vastly reduced in MitfMi mutants embryos, indicating that it is dependent on Mitf for in vivo expression. Consistent with this notion, a highly-conserved MITF binding site resides directly upstream of human GPNMB, and deletion of this sequence dramatically reduces in vitro enhancer activity.

Here we demonstrate that the IRE1  -XBP1 pathway, the most conserved branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is indispensable for adipogenesis.  Indeed, XBP1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 cells with XBP1 or IRE1   knockdown exhibit profound defects in adipogenesis.  Intriguingly, C/EBP  , a key early adipogenic factor, induces Xbp1 expression by directly binding to its proximal promoter region.  Subsequently, XBP1 binds to the promoter of Cebpa and activates its gene expression.  The posttranscriptional splicing of Xbp1 mRNA by IRE1   is required as only the spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s) rescues the adipogenic defect exhibited by XBP1-deficient cells.  Taken together, our data show that the IRE1  -XBP1 pathway plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation by acting as a critical regulator of the morphological and functional transformations during adipogenesis. The Xbp1 deficient MEFs are subjected to adipogenesis using standard drug induction.  The cells are collected at day 0 and day 3.

There are 6 time points across 14 days of in vitro differentiation in serum-free media. We used microarrays to define patterns of expression in a differentiating otic cell line.  Keywords: Temporal gene expression of 14 days of differentiation in vitro.

In addition to their deleterious effects on male genital development, population studies have recently documented correlations between phthalates exposure and subtle impacts on reproductive tract development and on the metabolic syndrome in male adults. In mature rodents liver di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) activates the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPARalpha), a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily.  OBJECTIVES: Using a systems biology approach, we aimed at defining potential mechanisms underlying the impacts of DEHP on adult mouse liver and testis.  METHODS: Thus, we performed a parallel analysis of transcript and metabolic profiles in the liver from adult mice exposed to varying DEHP doses. Moreover, we obtained pangenomic mRNA profiles of laser-captured Leydig and Sertoli cells from mature animals exposed to DEHP.  RESULTS: Hepatic genes modulated by DEHP are predominantly PPARalpha targets. However, the induction of some prototypic cytochrome P450 genes strongly supports the activation of additional NR pathways. Integration of hepatic transcriptomic and metabonomic profiles further revealed a correlation between the impacts of DEHP on a cluster of genes and metabolites linked to heme synthesis and on a cluster of Rev-erbalpha target genes related to metabolic and circadian clock pathways. Cell-specific effects of DEHP were investigated in the adult testis and a noticeable impact of DEHP was observed on Leydig cells transcriptome.  CONCLUSIONS: We report a detailed analysis of DEHP interference with hepatic Constitutive Androstane Receptor (CAR) and Rev-erbalpha pathways and a novel transcriptional impact of DEHP on adult endocrine cells of the testis.

Here we show that exposure of mice to cold led to conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown-like adipose tissue, accompanying the switch of an active angiogenic phenotype.  Gene expression profile analysis showed VEGF was upregulated via most likely hypoxia-independent PGC-1 transcriptional activation.  Intriguingly, VEGFR2 blockage abolished the cold-induced angiogenesis, significantly impaired nonshivering thermogenesis capacity, and markedly reduced adipose metabolism.  Unexpectedly, VEGFR1 blockage resulted in opposite effects by increasing adipose vascularity and metabolism.  These findings demonstrate that VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 mediate polarized activities in modulating adipose angiogenesis and metabolism. Taken together, our findings have conceptual implications in applying angiogenesis modulators for the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders.

While downstream signaling components have been characterized, the DNA sensing components remain largely elusive. We performed a systematic proteomics screen for proteins that associate with DNA, traversed to a screen for IFN-  -induced transcripts. We identified DSIRE (DNA sensor for the IL-1   response, previously called AIM2) as a candidate cytoplasmic sensor. DSIRE showed a marked selectivity for double-stranded DNA. DSIRE can recruit the inflammasome adaptor ASC and gets redistributed to ASC speckles upon coexpression of ASC. RNAi-mediated reduction of DSIRE expression led to an impairment in IL-1   maturation. Reconstitution of unresponsive cells with DSIRE, ASC, caspase 1 and IL-1   showed that DSIRE is sufficient for inflammasome activation. Overall, our data strongly suggest that DSIRE is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor for the inflammasome.

Disruption of this process can lead to prenatal lethality. In contrast, adult cardiomyocytes achieve growth through hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia. Although epicardial-derived signals may contribute to the proliferative process in myocytes, the factors and cell types responsible for development of the ventricular myocardial thickness are unclear. Moreover, the function of embryonic cardiac fibroblasts, derived from epicardium, and their secreted factors are largely unknown. Using a novel co-culture system, we found that embryonic cardiac fibroblasts induced proliferation of cardiomyocytes, in contrast to adult cardiac fibroblasts that promoted myocyte hypertrophy. We identified fibronectin, collagen and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor as embryonic cardiac fibroblast-specific signals that collaboratively promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation in a paracrine fashion. b1 integrin was required for this proliferative response, and ventricular cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of b1 integrin in mice resulted in reduced myocardial proliferation and impaired ventricular compaction. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized paracrine function of embryonic cardiac fibroblasts in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation. To identify candidate fibroblast-derived factors that promote myocyte proliferation, we isolated RNA from Nkx-YFP+ cardiomyocytes, embryonic cardiac fibroblasts, and adult cardiac fibroblasts and profiled mRNA expressions by microarray analyses.

The first one presents CREB as a critical component of the molecular switch that control longlasting forms of neuronal plasticity and learning. The second one relates CREB to neuronal survival and protection. To investigate the role of CREB-dependent gene expression in neuronal plasticity and survival in vivo, we generated bitransgenic mice expressing A-CREB, an artificial peptide with strong and broad inhibitory effect on the CREB family, in forebrain neurons in a regulatable manner. The expression of ACREB in hippocampal neurons impaired L-LTP, reduced intrinsic excitability and the susceptibility to induced seizures, and altered both basal and activity-driven gene expression. In the long-term, the chronic inhibition of CREB function caused severe loss of neurons in the CA1 subfield as well as in other brain regions.

Transcript profiling has expanded the repertoire of these markers by providing the snapshot of cellular status that reflects the activity of all genes. However, such data have been used only to assess relative similarities and differences of these cells. Here we show that principal component analysis (PCA) of global gene expression profiles map cells in multidimensional transcript profile space and the positions of differentiating cells progress in a stepwise manner along trajectories starting from undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells located in the apex. We present three cell lineage trajectories, which represent the differentiation of ES cells into the first three lineages in mammalian development: primitive endoderm, trophoblast, and primitive ectoderm/neural ectoderm. The positions of the cells along these trajectories seem to reflect the developmental potency of cells and can be used as a scale for the potential of cells. Indeed, we show that embryonic germ (EG) cells and induced pluripotent (iPS) cells are mapped near the origin of the trajectories, whereas mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) and fibroblast cell lines are mapped near the far end of the trajectories. We propose that this method can be used as the non-operational semi-quantitative definition of cell differentiation status and developmental potency. Furthermore, the global expression profiles of cell lineages provide a framework for the future study of in vitro and in vivo cell differentiation.

Leptin stimulates metalloproteinase activity in cultured human trophoblast and stimulates invasiveness of cultured mouse trophoblast.  The goal of the present study was to examine molecular mechanisms of this function in primary cultures of mouse trophoblast.  Leptin was found to stimulate the phosphorylation of MEK, but not STAT3.. It also increased levels of the protein SOCS3.  The ability of leptin to stimulate metalloproteinase activity was blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, but also by the vehicle inhibitor DMSO.  Microarray analysis revealed that leptin stimulated some genes associated with cell motility, such as Stmn1.  In addition, leptin appeared to inhibit changes in gene expression associated with terminal differentiation of trophoblast giant cells, including inhibition of members of the TGF   signaling pathway and of genes associated with endoreduplication.  However, feulgen staining revealed a loss of cells with low ploidy.  We conclude that leptin may be promoting trophoblast invasion by maintaining cells in an intermediate stage of differentiation. Keywords: time course, response to hormone treatment, primary cell culture The experiments were performed on primary cultures of mouse trophoblast cells which were isolated from placentas on day 10 of pregnancy.   There were two treatments: control (serum-free medium) and recombinant mouse leptin (50 ng/mL).  RNA was collected at two time points, 1 hour and 24 hours, for the controls.

Accordingly, established mediators of interferon antiviral activity may mediate previously unrecognized antibacterial functions. RNase-L is the terminal component of an RNA decay pathway that is an important mediator of interferon-induced antiviral activity. Here we identify a novel role for RNase-L in the host antibacterial response. RNase-L-/- mice exhibited a dramatic increase in mortality following  challenge with Bacillus anthracis and Escherichia coli; this increased susceptibility was due to a compromised immune response resulting in increased bacterial load. Investigation of the mechanisms of RNase-L antibacterial activity indicated that RNase-L is required for the optimal induction of proinflammatory cytokines that play essential roles in host defense from bacterial pathogens. RNase-L also regulated the expression of the endolysosomal protease, cathepsin-E, and endosome-associated activities, that function to eliminate internalized bacteria and may contribute to RNase-L antimicrobial action. Our results reveal a unique role for RNase-L in the antibacterial response that is mediated through multiple mechanisms.

Genetic association studies have identified sequence variants in the gene BCL11A that influence HbF levels. Here we examine BCL11A as a potential regulator of HbF expression. The high HbF BCL11A genotype is associated with reduced BCL11A expression. Moreover, abundant expression of full-length forms of BCL11A is developmentally restricted to adult erythroid cells. Down-regulation of BCL11A expression in primary adult erythroid cells leads to robust HbF expression. Consistent with a direct role of BCL11A in globin gene regulation, we find that BCL11A occupies several discrete sites in the beta-globin gene cluster. BCL11A emerges as a therapeutic target for reactivation of HbF in beta-hemoglobin disorders.

Therefore, aberrant expression of miRNA may be linked to immune dysfunction, such as in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.  In this study, we investigated the potential role of miRNA in estrogen-mediated regulation of innate immune responses, as indicated by upregulation of LPS-induced IFNg, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nitric oxide in splenic lymphocytes from estrogen-treated mice.  We found that miR-146a, a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, was decreased in freshly-isolated splenic lymphocytes from estrogen-treated mice compared to placebo controls.  Increasing the activity of miR-146a significantly inhibited LPS-induced IFNg and iNOS expression in mouse splenic lymphocytes.  Further, miRNA microarray and Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that estrogen selectively upregulates/downregulates the expression of miRNA in mouse splenic lymphocytes.  miR-223, which is highly upregulated by estrogen, regulates LPS-induced IFNg, but not iNOS or nitric oxide in splenic lymphocytes. Inhibition of miR-223 activity decreased LPS-induced IFNg in splenic lymphocytes from estrogen-treated mice. Our data are the first demonstrating selective regulation of miRNA expression in immune cells by estrogen and are indicative of an important role of miRNA in estrogen-mediated immune regulation.

Estradiol directs ductal elongation and branching within the adipose stroma of the adolescent mouse mammary gland, while progesterone leads to tertiary branching and alveolar development. The purpose of this investigation was to identify the estrogen-responsive genes that are associated with estrogen-stimulated ductal elongation and branching in the mouse mammary gland in the absence of other ovarian hormones. We also wanted to determine if estrogen-responsive gene regulation at early stages of ductal elongation (ie. when ductal growth was minimal) was similar to those regulated after significant ductal elongation had occurred. To identify estrogen-regulated genes, ovariectomized prepubertal mice were exposed to 17beta-estradiol for four weeks, and mammary gland global gene expression analyzed by microarray analysis at various points during this time course. We determined that while many genes are regulated in all weeks of treatment, there remained a subset of genes that was uniquely regulated at each time-point. This observation was reflected in the biological functions of these genes; some categories were represented in all weeks of treatment while others were specific to only certain time-points. We have also identified estradiol-responsive genes in the mouse mammary gland that co-express with Estrogen Receptor alpha in human breast cancer, which may represent novel effectors of estrogen action and/or biomarkers for the progression of estrogen-dependent cancers and other estrogen-driven diseases. For each time-course experiment, one frozen #4 mammary gland was individually pulverized from four to five animals per treatment group, then homogenized in 3mL Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer   s protocol. The RNA from individual animals was then pooled for each treatment group (four to five animals per group) and further purified using the QIAGEN (Valencia, CA) RNeasy Mini kit (Cat. No. 74104) clean-up protocol. Gene expression analysis was conducted using Agilent Mouse Oligo arrays (pattern number 011978) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Total RNA was amplified using the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit protocol. Starting with 500ng of total RNA, Cy3 or Cy5 labeled cRNA was produced according to manufacturer   s protocol. For each two color comparison, 750ng of each Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cRNAs were mixed and fragmented using the Agilent In Situ Hybridization Kit protocol. In each case, samples from estradiol-treated animals were co-hybridized with the day 7 placebo sample. Due to the rapid increase in adiposity in the mammary fat pad in the ovariectomized placebo-treated mice in days 14 and 28, the day 7 placebo sample was used as a control for all estradiol treated samples to avoid any variation due to this biological difference. Hybridizations were performed for 17 hours in a rotating hybridization oven using the Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray processing protocol. Slides were washed as indicated in this protocol and then scanned with an Agilent Scanner. Data was obtained using the Agilent Feature Extraction software (v7.5), using defaults for all parameters.The Agilent Feature Extraction Software performed error modeling, adjusting for additive and multiplicative noise.

We recently demonstrated that innate defense mechanisms of the lung are highly inducible against pneumococcal pneumonia.  To determine the breadth of protection conferred by stimulation of lung mucosal innate immunity, and to identify cells and signaling pathways activated by this treatment, mice were treated with an aerosolized bacterial lysate, then challenged with lethal doses of bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Mice were highly protected against a broad array of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Class A bioterror bacterial pathogens, and Aspergillus fumigatus.  Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing within the lungs, and this effect was recapitulated in vitro using a respiratory epithelial cell line.  Gene expression analysis of lung tissue showed marked activation of NF-kappaB, Type I and II interferon, and antifungal Card9-Bcl10-Malt1 pathways.  Cytokines were the most strongly induced genes, but the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 were not required for protection.  Lung-expressed antimicrobial peptides were also highly upregulated.  Taken together, stimulated innate resistance (StIR) appears to occur through the activation of multiple host defense signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells, inducing rapid pathogen killing, and conferring broad protection against virulent bacterial and fungal pathogens.  Augmentation of innate antimicrobial defenses of the lungs might have therapeutic value for protection of patients with neutropenia or impaired adaptive immunity against opportunistic pneumonia, and for defense of immunocompetent subjects against a bioterror threat or epidemic respiratory infection.

Retinoic acid (RA) increases TGF-beta-induced expression of Foxp3, through unknown molecular mechanisms. We showed here that, rather than enhancing TGF-beta signaling directly in naive CD4(+) T cells, RA negatively regulated an accompanying population of CD4(+) T cells with a CD44(hi) memory and effector phenotype. These memory cells actively inhibited the TGF-beta-induced conversion of naive CD4(+) T cells through the synthesis of a set of cytokines (IL-4, IL-21, IFN-gamma) whose expression was coordinately curtailed by RA. This indirect effect was evident in vivo and required the expression of the RA receptor alpha. Thus, cytokine-producing CD44(hi) cells actively restrain TGF-beta-mediated Foxp3 expression in naive T cells, and this balance can be shifted or fine-tuned by RA. All gene expression profiles were obtained from highly purified T cell populations sorted by flow cytometry.

Using Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice which express EGFP-tagged ribosomal protein L10a in defined cell populations, we have developed a methodology to affinity purify polysomal mRNAs from genetically defined cell populations in the brain. The utility of this approach is illustrated by the comparative analysis of four types of neurons, revealing hundreds of genes that distinguish these four cell populations. We find that even two morphologically indistinguishable, intermixed subclasses of medium spiny neuron display vastly different translational profiles and present examples of the physiological significance of such differences.

Although the rationale for oral diseases applications (e.g. oral cancer) is clear, the rationale and relationship between systemic diseases and saliva biomarkers are unknown. In this study, we used mouse models of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer and compared the transcriptome biomarker profiles of tumor-bearing mice to those of control mice. Microarray analysis showed that salivary transcriptomes were significantly altered in tumor-bearing mice vs. controls. Analysis of the transcriptomes in the mouse tumors, serum, salivary glands and saliva revealed that salivary biomarkers have multiple origins. Furthermore, we identified that the expression of two groups of significantly altered transcription factors Runx1, Mlxipl, Trim30 and Egr1, Tbx1, Nr1d1 in melanoma-bearing mice that can potentially be responsible for 82.6% of the up-regulated genes expression and 62.5% of the down-regulated gene expression in the mice saliva, respectively. We also confirmed that the ectopic production of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the melanoma tumor tissue as a tumor-released mediator that can induce expression of the transcription factor Egr-1 in the salivary gland. Taken together, our data support the conclusion that upon systemic disease development, a disease-specific change occurs in the salivary biomarker profile. Although the origins of the disease-specific salivary biomarkers are both systemic and local, stimulation of salivary gland by mediators released from remote tumors play an important role in regulating the salivary surrogate biomarker profiles.  Mice (either C57BL/6 mice or DBA/2 mice) were randomly assigned to control group and tumor group (15 animals per group). Melanoma mice model was induced by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of B16-F1 cells in 0.1 ml PBS into the lower-right flank of C57BL/6 mice. The lung cancer model was established by s.c. injection of KLN-205 cells in DBA/2 mice. Control animal were injected with PBS alone. Established tumors were observed after 2-3 weeks.When tumors reached 15 mm in diameter saliva was collected and the mice were sacrificed. Mild anesthesia was induced. Mice saliva was stimulated, obtained and immediately placed in pre-schilled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Collection was completed in 20 minutes and samples were stored at -80  C until analyzed.In addition, Blood was collected in BD Vacutainer tubes containing clot activator (BD Biosciences). Salivary gland and tumor tissue were removed from mice, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80  C.   Salivary,salivary gland, serum or tumor RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as described previously. There are 15 mice in the control group or tumor group (totally 30 C57BL/6 mice for melanoma mouse model, another 30 DBA/2 mice for lung cancer mouse model). Samples derived from 5 mice in each group were pooled and RNA extracted. The pooling is necessary to ensure sufficient salivary mRNA can be obtained for microarray analyses. Isolated total RNA was treated with recombinant DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX). For microarray analysis, mRNA from mouse saliva, gland or tumor was linearly amplified using the RiboAmp RNA Amplification kit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

We have defined a critical role of p53 in regulating hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, especially in promoting the enhanced quiescence seen in HSCs that lack the MEF/ELF4 transcription factor. Transcription profiling of HSCs isolated from wild type and p53 null mice identified Gfi-1 and Necdin as p53 target genes and using lentiviral vectors to upregulate or knockdown the expression of these genes, we show their importance in regulating HSC quiescence. Establishing the role of p53 (and its target genes) in controlling the cell cycle entry of HSCs may lead to therapeutic strategies capable of eliminating quiescent cancer (stem) cells.

Despite its important role during development, there are still relatively few genes with specific expression in the organizer and its derivatives. Foxa2 is a forkhead transcription factor that is absolutely required for formation of the mammalian equivalent of the organizer, the node, the axial mesoderm and the definitive endoderm (DE). However, the targets of Foxa2 during embryogenesis, and the molecular impact of organizer loss on the gastrula embryo, have not been well defined. Results:  To identify genes specific to the Spemann/Mangold organizer, we performed a microarray-based screen that compared wild-type and Foxa2 mutant embryos at late gastrulation stage (E7.5). We could detect genes that were consistently down-regulated in replicate pools of mutant embryos versus wild-type, and these included a number of known node and DE markers. We selected 314 genes without previously published data at E7.5 and screened for expression by whole mount in situ hybridization. We identified 10 novel expression patterns in the node and 5 in the definitive endoderm. We also found significant reduction of markers expressed in secondary tissues that require interaction with the organizer and its derivatives, such as cardiac mesoderm, vasculature, primitive streak, and anterior neuroectoderm. Conclusions: The genes identified in this screen represent novel Spemann/Mangold organizer genes as well as potential Foxa2 targets. Further investigation will be needed to define these genes as novel developmental regulatory factors involved in organizer formation and function.  We have placed these genes in a Foxa2-dependent genetic regulatory network and we hypothesize how Foxa2 may regulate a molecular program of Spemann/Mangold organizer development. We have also shown how early loss of the organizer and its inductive properties in an otherwise normal embryo, impacts on the molecular profile of surrounding tissues. Microarrays:Tetraploid embryos were derived as previously described (Nagy et al. 1990; Nagy et al. 1993) using Foxa2 null ES cells (Dufort et al. 1998). Wild type embryos were collected from timed matings of ICR mice. Wild type or tetraploid embryos were collected at E7.5 and staged accordingly (Downs and Davies 1993). Embryos were between mid-streak and head-fold stages and the extra-embryonic regions were removed by dissection. The embryo proper, including extra-embryonic tetraploid-derived VE, was retained and multiple samples were pooled for total RNA isolation using Trizol reagent. Numbers of E7.5 embryos collected and pooled were as follows: wild type 1 (n=53), wild type 2 (n=50), Foxa2 null 1 (n=53), Foxa2 null 2 (n=48). Total RNA from each of the four embryo pools was processed for Affymetrix Murine Genome U74Av2 GeneChip analysis as previously described (Lickert et al. 2005).Data analysis:Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software was applied to the U74Av2 GeneChip data to target normalize the global expression level to 1000, and provide present, absent and fold change calls in a cross-comparisons of all replicate mutant samples over the two replicate wild-type samples. Next probe sets with absent calls in all samples were removed from the data set. As well, all samples with illogical calls were also removed, for example a probe set with an increase call that was called absent in the sample with the higher level of expression. Lastly, we filtered the data to include only probe sets that showed a statistical change call in two or more (2/4) of the cross comparisons.MOE430v2 GeneChips were analyzed as follows in the R statistical programming language (R Core Development Team, 2006; see Additional File 11 for details). Probeset summaries were calculated according to the MAS 5.0 algorithm. Logarithmic summary values were normalized by the loess smoother applied to the M-A scale transform. Statistical testing for differential expression between mutant and wild-type was performed on single probe level taking the duplicate chips into account employing the Wilcoxon paired rank test. The p-value threshold was adjusted by either family-wise error rate (FWER, Bonferroni procedure) or the false discovery rate (FDR, Bejamini-Hochberg technique). Significant probesets were tested for enrichment of GO terms by the hypergeometric distribution testing with the annotation as available from the GO consortium on March 25th, 2005. ..

Resiquimod treatment has been demonstrated to inhibit the development of allergen induced asthma in experimental models.  Despite this demonstrated effectiveness, little is known about the molecular events responsible for this effect.  The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular processes which were altered following resiquimod treatment and antigen challenge in a mouse model of allergic asthma.  Employing microarray analysis, we have characterized the    asthmatic    transcriptome of the murine lung and determined that it includes genes involved in: the control of cell cycle progression, airway remodelling, the complement and coagulation cascades, and chemokine signalling.  We have demonstrated that systemic resiquimod administration resulted in the recruitment of NK cells to the lungs of the mice, although no causal relationship between NK cell recruitment and treatment efficacy was found.  Furthermore, results of our studies demonstrated that resiquimod treatment resulted in the normalization of the expression of genes involved with airway remodelling and chemokine signalling, and in the modulation of the expression of genes including cytokines and chemokines, adhesion molecules, and B-cell related genes, involved in several aspects of immune function and antigen presentation.  Overall, our findings identified several genes, important in the development of asthma pathology, that were normalized following resiquimod treatment thus improving our understanding of the molecular consequences of resiquimod treatment in the lung milieu.

We found that that Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall fragments, containing primarily peptidoglycan and teichoic acids, induced prodigious secretion of IL-10 from macrophages and dendritic cells and was dependent on TLR2 and NOD2, a cytoplasmic CARD-NACHT-LRR protein encoded by Card15. IL-10 secretion in response to cell walls was also dependent on RICK/RIP2, a kinase associated with NOD2, and MYD88 but independent of the ERK/p38 pathway. The reduction of IL-10 secretion by cell wall-activated NOD2-deficient myeloid   derived cells translated into downstream effects on IL-10 target gene expression and elevations in subsets of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression normally restrained by autocrine/paracrine effects of IL-10. Since NOD2 is linked to aberrant immune responses in Crohn   s Disease patients bearing mutations in CARD15, the temporal and quantitative effects of the TLR2/NOD/RICK pathway on IL-10 secretion may affect homeostatic control of immune responses to gram-positive bacteria.

To investigate the relative role of CAR and PXR in the induction response, cDNA arrays were generated containing 120 genes which are known to be regulated with these or related nuclear receptors (genes involved in drug metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, sterol synthesis/transport, heme synthesis). Samples from livers of wild type and CAR-/-, PXR-/- or CAR/PXR-/- knockout mice were tested after treatment with PB for gene expression within the  European Framework V program    Steroltalk    (www.steroltalk.net). Results from these experiments unexpectedly revealed that if CAR and PXR are deleted, PB increases the expression of several other nuclear receptors and genes involved in drug metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.  Animals were injected i.p. 100mg/kg phenobarbital or vehicle (5% DMSO in corn oil). After 12h they were sacrificed and total RNA was isolated from the livers.

As one example of such heterogeneity, we have focused on the observation that lymphomas develop in E  -myc mice with a variable time of onset.  Twenty-five early-onset, 25 late-onset lymphomas and 10 normal samples were each assayed on an Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array.

Unfortunately, information on the nature of PPARalpha-dependent processes in cardiac hypertrophy is fragmentary and incomplete. The primary aim of this study was to identify the processes and signaling pathways regulated by PPARalpha in hearts challenged by a chronic pressure overload by means of whole genome transcriptomic analysis. Second, we wanted to gain insight how PPARalpha modulates the identified processes, e.g. by trans-activation or by trans-repression.  Keywords: 28 days of TAC Wild-type and PPARalpha-/- mice were sham-operated or subjected to TAC for 28 days. Left ventricular gene expression profile was determined using Affymetrix 430 2.0 arrays containing over 45,000 probe sets (covering over 34,000 mouse genes) to detect PPARalpha-related differences in cardiac gene expression under basal conditions and after imposition of a sustained hemodynamic stress. ..

We and others have shown that resveratrol mimics effects of DR in lower organisms. In mice, we find that resveratrol induces gene expression patterns in multiple tissues that parallel those induced by DR and every-other-day feeding. Moreover, resveratrol-fed elderly mice shows a marked reduction in signs of aging including reduced albuminuria, decreased inflammation and apoptosis in the vascular endothelium, increased aortic elasticity, greater motor coordination, reduced cataract formation, and preserved bone mineral density. However, mice fed a standard diet did not live longer when treated with resveratrol beginning at mid-life. Our findings indicate that resveratrol treatment has a range of beneficial effects in mice but does not increase the longevity of ad libitum-fed animals when started mid-life. Male C57BL/6NIA mice at 11 months of age were maintained on a standard purified mouse diet (AIN-93G) for one month prior to the start of the experiment. Beginning at one year of age, SD and EOD groups were fed a standard AIN-93G diet or AIN-93G plus 0.01% or 0.04% resveratrol for the duration of the study. Three separate groups were placed on an HC diet (AIN-93G modified by the addition of hydrogenated coconut oil to provide 60% of calories from fat) or HC + 0.01% or 0.04% resveratrol 6 weeks later and remained on those diets throughout the study. SD and HC mice were fed ad libitum. EOD mice were fed ad libitum on alternate days then moved to a separate cage without food for 24 h. Food intake and body weight were measured on a weekly basis for the duration of the study. ..

No|GSE8171|Not Applicable|Not Curated|transcription profiling by array|2021-09-25|60|1548|Prox-1 promotes invasion of kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas|Kaposi   s sarcoma (KS) is the most frequently occurring malignant tumor in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Recent studies have revealed that infection of vascular endothelial cells with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus in vitro results in a lymphatic re-programming of these cells, with potent induction of the lymphatic marker genes podoplanin and VEGFR-3 which is mediated by upregulation of the transcription factor Prox1. However, the potential effects of Prox1 expression on the biology of KS and, in particular, on the aggressive and invasive behavior of KS tumors in vivo have remained unknown. We stably expressed Prox1 cDNA in the two mouse hemangioendothelioma cell lines EOMA and Py-4-1, well-established murine models for kaposiform hemangioendothelioma. Surprisingly, we found that expression of Prox1 was sufficient to induce a more aggressive behavior of tumors growing in syngenic mice, leading to enhanced local invasion into the muscular layer and to cellular anaplasia.

Drinking water standards are based primarily on epidemiology and extrapolation from higher dose experiments, rather than measurements of phenotypic changes associated with chronic exposure to levels of arsenic similar to the current standard of 10ppb, and little is known about the difference between arsenic in food as opposed to arsenic in water. Measurement of phenotypic changes at low doses may be confounded by the effect of laboratory diet, in part because of trace amounts of arsenic in standard laboratory chows, but also because of broad metabolic changes in response to the chow itself.

Whereas the central DNA binding domain is highly conserved among the three family members p53, p63 and p73, the C-terminal domains (CTDs) are diverse and subject to alternative splicing and post-translational modification. Here we demonstrate that the CTDs strongly influence DNA binding and transcriptional activity. While p53 and the p73 isoform p73gamma have basic CTDs and form weak sequence-specific protein-DNA complexes, the major p73 isoforms alpha, beta and delta have neutral CTDs and bind DNA strongly. A basic CTD has been previously shown to enable sliding along the DNA backbone and to facilitate the search for binding sites in the complex genome. Our experiments, however, reveal that a basic CTD also reduces protein-DNA complex stability, intranuclear mobility, promoter occupancy in vivo, transgene activation and induction of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. A basic CTD in p53 and p73gamma therefore provides both positive and negative regulatory functions presumably to enable rapid switching of protein activity in response to stress. In contrast, most p73 isoforms exhibit constitutive DNA binding activity consistent with a predominant role in developmental control.

However, neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis, which normally commences at later stages of fetal telencephalic development. Astrocyte differentiation of mouse NPCs at embryonic day (E) 14.5 (relatively late gestation) is induced by activation of the transcription factor STAT3, whereas at E11.5 (mid-gestation) NPCs do not differentiate into astrocytes even when stimulated by STAT3-activating cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This can be explained in part by the fact that astrocyte-specific gene promoters are highly methylated in NPCs at E11.5, but other mechanisms are also likely to play a role. We therefore sought to identify genes involved in the inhibition of astrocyte differentiation of NPCs at midgestation. We first examined gene expression profiles in E11.5 and E14.5 NPCs, using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis, applying the Percellome method to normalize gene expression level. We then conducted in situ hybridization analysis for selected genes found to be highly expressed in NPCs at midgestation. Among these genes, we found that N-myc and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (Hmga2) were highly expressed in the E11.5 but not the E14.5 ventricular zone of mouse brain, where NPCs reside. Transduction of N-myc and Hmga2 by retroviruses into E14.5 NPCs, which normally differentiate into astrocytes in response to LIF, resulted in suppression of astrocyte differentiation. However, sustained expression of N-myc and Hmga2 in E11.5 NPCs failed to maintain the hypermethylated status of an astrocyte-specific gene promoter. Taken together, our data suggest that astrocyte differentiation of NPCs is regulated not only by DNA methylation but also by genes whose expression is controlled spatio-temporally during brain development.

Chronic TNFalpha exposure has been shown to down-modulate T cell responses.  In a mouse T cell hybridoma model, TNFalpha attenuated T cell receptor (TCR) signaling.  We have confirmed that chronic TNFalpha and anti-TNFalpha exposure suppressed and increased T cell responses in BDC2.5 CD4+ T cells, respectively.  The goal of this study is to analyze global transcriptional alterations resulting from TNFalpha treatment on TCR signaling pathways using cDNA microarrays.  We found that genes involved in functional categories including T cell signaling, cell cycle, proliferation, ubiquitination, cytokine synthesis, calcium signaling, and apoptosis were modulated.  Genes such as ubiquitin family genes, cytokine inducible SH2-containing genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p57, calmodulin family genes (calmodulin -V1, -V2, and ?V3) and calcium channel voltage- dependent, N type alpha1B subunit (CaV2.2) were induced by TNFalpha, while Vav2, Rho GTPase activating protein, calcium channel voltage dependent, L type alpha 1C subunit (CaV1.2), interleukin-1 (IL) receptor-associated kinase 1, and -V2 (IRAK-1and -2) and IL enhancer binding factor 3 were reduced by TNFalpha.  Genes such as CaV1.2 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, repressed by TNFalpha, were induced by anti-TNF treatment.  Further, we showed that chronic TNFalpha exposure impaired NF-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation activity, leading to T cell unresponsiveness.  Thus, our results present a detailed picture of transcriptional programs affected by chronic TNFalpha exposure, and provide candidate target genes, which may function to mediate TNFalpha induced T cell unresponsiveness.

To this end ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD4 (OTII) T cells transferred into congenic mice were studied. Live attenuated OVA-expressing Salmonella (SalOVA) induce T-bet and IFN-g in OTII cells, while alum-precipitated OVA (alumOVA) induces GATA-3 and IL-4. Although 70% of alumOVA-responding OTII cells express GATA-3, only 7% produce IL-4. Thus Th2-polarization defined solely by IL-4 production does not recognize the diversity of GATA-3-expressing effectors. Low-density arrays were designed to assess the expression of 384 genes by real-time RT-PCR. Extensive early diversification occurred in both responses. SalOVA selectively induced many chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, while alumOVA induced few Th2-associated cytokines. Several cytokines and molecules associated with Th17 cells and follicular helper cells were also induced by both antigens. The transcription factor Helios was exclusively induced in alumOVA-responding OTII cells, and critically not in standard in vitro Th2-polarization systems. Early synchronous up-regulation of Helios and GATA-3 mRNA is paralleled at protein level with largely coincident localization in specific nuclear foci of OTII cells responding to alumOVA.

Though regarded as the first kinase in the signaling cascade, the role of IRAK-4 kinase activity versus its scaffold function is still controversial. In order to investigate the role of IRAK-4 kinase function in vivo,    knock-in    mice were generated by replacing the wild type IRAK-4 gene with a mutant gene encoding kinase deficient IRAK-4 protein (IRAK-4 KD). Analysis of bone marrow macrophages obtained from WT and IRAK-4 KD mice with a number of experimental techniques demonstrated that the IRAK-4 KD cells greatly lack responsiveness to stimulation with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist LPS. One of the techniques used, microarray analysis, identified IRAK-4 kinase-dependent LPS response genes and revealed that the induction of LPS-responsive mRNAs was largely ablated in IRAK-4 KD cells.

This program, resulting in shorter 3' UTRs, is a characteristic of immune cell activation and strongly correlates with proliferation across diverse cell types and tissues.  Enforced expression of full-length 3' UTRs confers differences in protein expression that can in some cases be eliminated by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region.

Whether the Ca2+ signaling events impact long-term development, in particular development to term, is unknown. Using fertilized eggs that have undergone the first few Ca2+ oscillations, we developed procedures that result either in inhibiting or stimulating the natural pattern of Ca2+ signaling of inseminated eggs. Although the incidence of development to the blastocyst stage is unaltered by these procedures, fewer offspring are born following embryo transfer, indicating that developmental competence of the blastocysts is reduced. Interestingly, embryo transfer experiments reveal that when the natural regime of Ca2+ oscillations is precociously interrupted, the incidence of implantation is compromised whereas hyper-stimulation of Ca2+ signaling events compromises post-implantation development. Moreover, although there was no major difference in the overall growth rates of the offspring, those obtained following hyper-stimulation exhibited a far greater variability in their weight. Analysis of global patterns of gene expression by microarray analysis revealed that approximately 20% of the transcripts are mis-regulated when too few oscillations are experienced by the embryo and EASE analysis indicates that genes preferentially involved in RNA processing and polymerase II transcription are differentially affected. In addition, a set of genes involved in cell adhesion is also mis-expressed and could thus be mechanistically linked to the observed reduced implantation. Only about 3% of the transcripts were mis-regulated following hyper-stimulation, and EASE analysis indicates that genes preferentially involved in metabolism are differentially affected. In toto, these results indicate that a range Ca2+ signaling events following fertilization (an excess or reduction) has long-term effects on both gene expression and development to term.  We profiled the global gene expression in the blastocysts by treatment of Ca2+ oscillations, and identified the genes differentially expressed. .. blastocyst treated by 20 pulses;  control blastocyst;  control mouse blastocyst;  gene expression of blastocyst cultured by Ca free medium;  normal mouse blastocyst;  total RNA;  blastocyst cultured in Ca2+ free medium;  blastocyst treated by 20 Ca2+ pulses;  control blastocyst;  10090;  Mus musculus;

RLSCs capability to spontaneously differentiate into hepatocytes, the lack of albumin expression and the broad differentiative potentiality locate them in a pre-hepatoblast/liver precursor cells hierarchical position. In conclusion, RLSCs may provide an useful tool to improve liver stem cell knowledge and to assess new therapeutic approaches for liver diseases.

However, the molecular determinants specifying neurogenic radial glia differently from radial glia that mostly self-renew remain ill-defined. Here, we isolated two radial glial subsets that co-exist at mid-neurogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex and their immediate progeny. While one subset generates neurons directly, the other is largely non-neurogenic but also gives rise to Tbr2-positive basal precursors, thereby contributing indirectly to neurogenesis. Isolation of  these distinct radial glia subtypes allowed determining interesting differences in their transcriptome. These transcriptomes were also strikingly different from the transcriptome of radial glia isolated at the end of neurogenesis. This analysis therefore identifies, for the first time, the lineage origin of basal progenitors and the molecular differences of this lineage in comparison to directly neurogenic and gliogenic radial glia.

This study characterizes the global transcriptional response of mouse liver to a symptomatic dose (0.26 ng/g) of the highly potent Pacific ciguatoxin-1 (P-CTX-1).  At 1 h post exposure 2.4% of features on a 44K whole genome array were differentially expressed (p     0.0001), increasing to 5.2% at 4 h and decreasing to 1.4% by 24 h post-CTX exposure.  Early gene expression was likely influenced prominently by an acute 4   C decline in core body temperature by 1 h, which resolved by 8 h following exposure.  Cytochrome P450s were of particular interest due to their role in xenobiotic metabolism.  Twenty-seven genes, mostly members of Cyp2 and Cyp4 families, showed significant changes in expression.  Many Cyps underwent an initial down-regulation at 1 h but were quickly and strongly up-regulated at 4 and 24 h post exposure.  In addition to Cyps, increases in several glutathione S-transferases were observed, an indication that both phase I and phase II metabolic reactions are involved in the hepatic response to CTX in mice.

Several birth defects and some cancers are due to inappropriate or defective DNA repair machinery indicating that a right activity of DNA repair genes in the early stages of fetal development are essential for an appropriate DNA function.  Neuroblastoma (NB), an embryonal tumor deriving from neural crest cells (NCCs) is diagnosed in about 30% of patients within the first year of life. Moreover, several reports show that NB can be detected in foetus and in neonatal period. To assess gene expression profiling of DNA repair genes during early stage of development, we performed a genome-wide analysis of Neural Crest cells (NCCs) generating a gene expression database that can help to better understand the gene(s) involved in both genetic and cancer diseases. We found 11 genes involved in DNA repair activity during mouse embryo development overexpressed in early stages. Six out 11 were never been described in mouse embryology.

This observation led us to speculate that the differences between embryonic trachea and lung are defined by limited subset of genes, and that the molecular comparison of these two tissues might provide new information on genes that are important for both lung and trachea development.  Microarray experiments designed to identify genes differentially expressed in the E11.5 lung and trachea showed that melanoma inhibitory activity (Mia1) was expressed only in the lung.  Mia1 was abundantly expressed during early lung development, but was virtually absent by the end of gestation.  Bitransgenic mice expressing MIA under the control of the SFTPC promoter after E16.5, the age when Mia1 is normally silenced, died from respiratory failure at birth with morphologically immature lungs associated with reduced levels of saturated phosphatidylcholine and mature SP-B.

Epidermal abrasion was used to synchronously induce epidermal regeneration in FVB/N wild type and transgenic Tg.AC mice.  Skin papillomagenesis was uniquely induced in Tg.AC mice, and gene expression profiling was carried out using a 22,000 element mouse DNA microarray.  Histological analysis showed that papillomas developed at a high rate by day 30 after abrasion in transgenic animals, while no papilloma developed in wild type mice.  Transgene specific differentially expressed genes were identified at day 30 post-abrasion and these genes were annotated using EASE software and literature mining.  Annotated and non-annotated genes associated with papilloma development were identified and clustering analysis revealed groups of genes that are coordinately expressed.  A number of genes associated with differentiation and development were also physically clustered on mouse chromosome 16, including 16B3 that contains several Stefins and stefin-like genes, and 16A1 containing a number of keratin associated protein genes.

Curcumin and rutin are polyphenolic compounds known to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, but their mechanism(s) of action are yet to be fully elucidated. Mdr1a-/- mice spontaneously develop intestinal inflammation, predominantly in the colon, with pathology similar to IBD, so this mouse model is relevant for studying diet-gene interactions and potential effects of foods on remission or development of IBD. This study tested whether the addition of curcumin or rutin to the diet would alleviate colonic inflammation in mdr1a-/- mice. Using whole-genome microarrays, the effect of dietary curcumin on gene expression in colon tissue was also investigated. Twelve mice were randomly assigned to each of three diets; control (AIN-76A), control + 0.2% curcumin or control + 0.1% rutin and monitored from the age of 7 to 24 weeks. Curcumin, but not rutin, significantly reduced histological signs of colonic inflammation in mdr1a-/- mice. Microarray and pathway analyses suggested that the effect of dietary curcumin on colon inflammation could be via an up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism and a down-regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways probably mediated by PXR and PPARalpha activation of RXR. These results reveal the potential of global gene expression and pathway analyses to study and better understand the effect of foods in colonic inflammation. Keywords: Colonic inflammation, gene expression, curcumin, rutin, genome-wide microarrays Twelve mice were randomly assigned to each of three diets; control (AIN-76A), control + 0.2% curcumin or control + 0.1% rutin and monitored from the age of 7 to 24 weeks. As only curcumin significantly reduced colonic HIS, comparison of the gene expression levels in colon was carried out using total RNA from colon tissue of four mdr1a-/- mice from the control group (high HIS) and four mdr1a-/- mice from the curcumin group (low HIS).

Gene expression was calculated via two different methods, using the 3'-most exon probe ("3' gene expression profiling") and using all probes associated with the gene ("whole-transcript gene expression profiling"), while exon expression was determined using exon probes and flanking junction probes that spanned across the neighboring exons("exon expression profiling").  Widespread strain and sex influences were detected using a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) regardless of the profiling method used.  However, over 90% of the genes identified in 3' gene expression profiling or whole transcript profiling were identified in exon profiling, along with 75% and 38% more genes, respectively, showing evidence of differential isoform expression. Overall, 55% and 32% of genes, respectively, exhibited strain- and sex-bias differential gene or exon expression. Keywords: Grouped Hybridization material was generated through a random-priming amplification of poly[A]+ purified RNA using primers with a random sequence at the 3' end and a fixed motif at the 5' end that was optimized to generate strand-specific cDNA copies of full-length mRNA transcripts [32].  Since the region used for exon and junction probe selection is constrained to a smaller region, more probes contain sequence with suboptimal characteristics (e.g. high GC content or higher homology to other genes).  The hybridization of cDNA, rather than cRNA as commonly done, partially mitigates this issue due to higher specificity and lower background levels [24]. Hybridization conditions were as previously described [33].  All 71 samples were hybridized in a two-channel experiment, where one channel was a common reference, generated by pooling all 71 samples in equal mass.  Array hybridizations were done in duplicate with fluor reversal to systematically correct for Cy3/Cy5 dye bias.

Here, we report a strong but transient induction of miR-155 in mouse bone marrow after injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) correlated with granulocyte/monocyte (GM) expansion. Demonstrating the sufficiency of miR-155 to drive GM expansion, enforced expression in mouse bone marrow cells caused GM proliferation in a manner reminiscent of LPS treatment. However, the mir-155-induced GM populations displayed pathological features characteristic of myeloid neoplasia. Extending possible relevance to human disease, miR-155 was overexpressed in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, miR-155 repressed a subset of genes implicated in hematopoietic development and disease. These data implicate miR-155 as a contributor to physiological GM expansion during inflammation and to certain pathological features associated with AML, emphasizing the importance of proper miR-155 regulation in developing myeloid cells during times of inflammatory stress.

We sought to study the impact of CD4+ T cell polarization on efficacy of tumor rejection in a model closely mimicking human disease where the target antigens are often non-mutated tissue differentiation self-antigens. We generated a new transgenic mouse model in which CD4+ T cells recognize a novel epitope in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1), an antigen that is expressed by normal melanocytes and B16 murine melanoma. We found that cells could be robustly polarized into Th0, Th1 and Th17 subtypes in vitro, as evidenced by cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule profiles as well as by surface markers, suggesting the potential for differential effector function in vivo. Contrary to the current view that Th1 cells play the most important role in tumor rejection, we found that Th17-polarized cells were superior in mediating destruction of advanced B16 melanoma. Unexpectedly, their therapeutic effect was critically dependent on IFN-   production, while depletion of IL-17A and IL-23 had little impact. Taken together, these data indicate that the appropriate in vitro polarization of effector CD4+ T cells is decisive for the successful tumor eradication. This principle should be taken under consideration in the design of future clinical trials involving adoptive transfer-based immunotherapy of human malignancies.

The goal of the experiment: Age-Dependent Gene Expression Profiles After Hepatic Ischemia/Reperfusion: Implications for the AP-1 and Ubiquitin-Proteosome Pathways 2. Brief description of the experiment: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a complication of liver surgery, transplantation and shock.  Our previous studies have suggested there is an age-dependent response to I/R.  In the present study, we examined global gene expression after liver I/R in young (4-5 weeks) and adult (12-14 months) mice using Affymetrix microarray.  Gene expression was filtered based on a change in expression of 1.5-fold relative to respective controls and then analyzed by ANOVA.  Seventy-two genes in young mice and 56 genes in adult mice had significantly increased expression.  Of these, only 18 were up-regulated in both age groups.  In young mice, 289 genes were down-regulated whereas in adult mice, 874 genes were decreased.  Of these genes, 175 genes were decreased in both groups.  Pathway and network analyses of up- and down-regulated gene lists revealed a number of notable differences between young and adult mice.  Of these, we found that genes related to the activating protein-1 (AP-1) pathway were upregulated preferentially in young mice.  This corresponded with an increase in AP-1 activation in young versus adult mice.  Finally, we found that genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were selectively down-regulated in adult mice.  This was accompanied by reduced degradation of the inhibitory protein, I?B?, in adult mice.  The data demonstrate specific, pathway- and network-related differences in gene expression profiles between young and adult mice in the response to I/R.  More specifically, we have identified two pathways that may contribute to the superior response to I/R in young mice which represent potential therapeutic targets.

They can be defined as a population adult muscle stem cells based on their self renewal capability and ability to differentiate into skeletal muscle fibers. Functional Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) is essential for the process of skeletal muscle differentiation in satellite cell derived primary myoblasts. Furthermore, the biochemical function of pRb is largely associated with its ability to interact with chromatin modifying factors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone methyltransferases thus inhibiting transcription of target gene promoters. Hence, expression profiling of pRb null primary myoblasts and myotubes will provide a global picture of the downstream targets of pRb transcriptional regulation in relation to cell cycle control, apoptosis inhibition, and muscle differentiation.

Both cytokines promote the function of effector CD8+ T cells, but their distinct effects on antigen-driven differentiation of na  ve CD8+ T cells into effector CD8+ T cells are not clearly understood. We found that antigen-induced expression of eomesodermin and maturation of na  ve CD8+ T cells into granzyme B and CD44 expressing effector CD8+ T cells was enhanced by IL-2, but, unexpectedly, suppressed by IL-21. Furthermore, IL-21 repressed expression of IL-2Ra and inhibited IL-2-mediated acquisition of a cytolytic CD8+ T cell phenotype. Despite its inhibitory effects, IL-21 did not induce anergy, but instead potently enhanced the capacity of cells to mediate tumor regression upon adoptive transfer. In contrast, IL-2, surprisingly, impaired the subsequent anti-tumor function of transferred cells. Gene expression studies revealed a distinct IL-21-program that was characterized phenotypically by increased expression of L-selectin and functionally by enhanced anti-tumor immunity that was not reversed by secondary in vitro stimulation with antigen and IL-2. Thus, the efficacy of CD8+ T cells for adoptive immunotherapy can be influenced by opposing differentiation programs conferred by IL-2 and IL-21, a finding with important implications for the development of cellular cancer therapies.

Here, by using a murine A/E pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium, we demonstrate that C. rodentium infection is lethal to IL-22-/- mice within two weeks. IL-22, in the early phase of infection, is indispensable for preventing the invasion of bacteria through the intestinal epithelium, and thereby preventing systemic spread and mortality.  We also show that IL-23 is required for the early induction of IL-22 during C. rodentium infection.

Several promising treatments are in various stages of evaluation, but many have failed to prove beneficial in large randomized clinical trials (RCT). The first definitive step forward in ALI therapeutics occurred recently as a result of a large RCT demonstrating a mortality decrease from 40 to 31% with the use of low-volume ventilation strategies. From this, it is clear that the opportunity for successful intervention in ALI exists. However, therapeutic advances remain frustrated by the lack of complete understanding of ALI pathophysiology. This stresses the importance of integrating basic and clinical research of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. The conclusions of a recent National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Working Group on ALI support this type of research as a priority for future investigations of ALI. One of the areas of research given priority by this ALI Working Group is the issue of ALI severity progression and the role of cells of innate immunity in this process. Currently, the processes that determine which ALI patients progress to ARDS and which do not are unclear. As with many phenotype differences, there is most likely a genetic component involved. The basis for this has been demonstrated. For example, a surfactant protein B (SP-B) polymorphism appears to increase a patient   s risk of developing ALI from pneumonia. Additionally, a polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene for interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been associated with a poor prognosis in patients with ARDS. Understanding the intracellular processes of these genes and the cells expressing them in ALI progression could lead to the identification of molecular markers of ALI severity and eventually to the development of targeted therapies. An examination of genetically uniform animals will provide a clearer insight into the interaction between immune cells in ALI progression as well as guide future human experiments.

Recently, a common polymorphism at the exon 4-intron 4 boundary of the human cyclin D1 gene within a splice donor region was associated with an altered risk of developing cancer.

In AML, the recurring t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) translocation fuses NSD1 to nucleoporin-98 (NUP98). Here, we present the first characterization of the transforming properties and molecular mechanisms of NUP98-NSD1. We demonstrate that NUP98-NSD1 induces AML in vivo, sustains self-renewal of myeloid stem cells in vitro, and enforces expression of the HoxA7, HoxA9, HoxA10 and Meis1 proto-oncogenes. Mechanistically, NUP98-NSD1 binds genomic elements adjacent to HoxA7 and HoxA9, maintains histone H3 Lys 36 (H3K36) methylation and histone acetylation, and prevents EZH2-mediated transcriptional repression of the Hox-A locus during differentiation. Deletion of the NUP98 FG-repeat domain, or mutations in NSD1 that inactivate the H3K36 methyltransferase activity or that prevent binding of NUP98-NSD1 to the Hox-A locus precluded both Hox-A gene activation and myeloid progenitor immortalization. We propose that NUP98-NSD1 prevents EZH2-mediated repression of Hox-A locus genes by colocalizing H3K36 methylation and histone acetylation at regulatory DNA elements. This report is the first to link deregulated H3K36 methylation to tumorigenesis and to link NSD1 to transcriptional regulation of the Hox-A locus.

At present, acute rejection is diagnosed by transbronchial lung biopsies, which are invasive, expensive, and subject to significant sampling error. In this study, we sought to identify groups of genes whose collective expression in BAL cells best classifies acute rejection versus no-rejection. BAL samples were analyzed from 32 unique subjects whose concurrent histology showed acute rejection (n=14) or no rejection (n=18).  Global BAL cell gene expression was measured using Affymetrix U133A microarrays.  The nearest shrunken centroid method with 10-fold cross validation was used to define the classification model.  250 runs of the algorithm were performed to determine the range of misclassification error and the most influential genes in determining classifiers. The estimated overall misclassification rate was below 20%. Seven transcripts were present in every classifier and 52 transcripts were present in at least 70% of classifiers; these transcripts were notable for involvement with T-cell function, cytotoxic CD8 activity, and granulocyte degranulation. The proportions of both lymphocytes and neutrophils in BAL samples increased with increasing probability of acute rejection; this trend was more pronounced with neutrophils. We conclude that there is a prominent acute rejection-associated signature in BAL cells characterized by increased T-cell, CD8+ cytotoxic cell, and neutrophil gene expression; this is consistent with established mechanistic concepts of the acute rejection response.   Keywords: Disease State Analysis Lung transplant recipients surviving at least 30 days after transplantation at the University of Minnesota were eligible for enrollment in the study.  The study was approved by the University   s Institutional Review Board, and all patients provided written informed consent.  Subjects underwent scheduled surveillance (n = 22) and clinically indicated (decreased pulmonary function tests or new radiographic abnormalities) bronchoscopies (n = 10), in which 100-200 cc of sterile saline was instilled into a single anatomic location (right middle lobe or lingula), and recovered using gentle suction.  4-6 transbronchial biopsies (TBB) were obtained from the same subsegmental location as the BAL, and 4-6 additional TBB were obtained from the lower lobe of the same lung.  After sending samples for clinical tests, approximately 50 ml of the recovered BAL effluent was immediately placed on ice.  BAL cell counts and differentials were determined with a hemocytometer.  Specimens from subjects with active bronchopulmonary infections (as determined by history, exam, chest radiograph, and the results of routine laboratory tests and cultures) were excluded from analysis.  All biopsy specimens were graded according to standard International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria8.  Vascular and airway cellular infiltrate were scored separately on A (vascular) and B (airway) scales, each score ranging from 0 to 48;23;24.  For the purposes of this analysis, acute rejection was defined as a combined A+B score greater than or equal to 2; and no-rejection was defined as a combined A+B score less than 2.  The BAL samples used in this study were selected according to strict criteria that were designed to maximize potential differences in gene expression between acute rejection and non-acute rejection BAL samples; and to minimize bias from confounding factors.  Each subject (n=32) was represented by one BAL sample in this study.  Control subjects and samples (n=14) were selected according to the following criteria: 1) A+B score was 0 or 1 for all biopsies collected from each subject during his/her post-transplant course; 2) at least three biopsies had been graded from each subject; 3) the subject had survived at least one year post-transplant; 4) the selected BAL sample was culture negative for pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses; and 5) the selected sample was from a patient that had not developed BOS or was collected at least 6 months prior to the development of BOS.  Rejection subjects and samples (n=18) were selected according to the following criteria: 1) the BAL sample was culture negative for pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses; 2) for subjects with more than one acute rejection sample, we used the first acute rejection sample (A+B score > 1); 3) BOS grade was 0 at the time of BAL sampling (although some subjects subsequently developed BOS). ..

Here we describe the first method for the isolation and purification of developing and mature astrocytes from mouse forebrain.  This method takes advantage of the expression of S100   by astrocytes.  We used fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate EGFP positive cells from transgenic mice that express EGFP under the control of an S100   promoter.  By depletion of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes we obtained purified populations of neurons, while by panning with oligodendrocyte-specific antibodies we obtained purified populations of oligodendrocytes.  Using GeneChip Arrays we then created a transcriptome database of the expression levels of over 20,000 genes by gene profiling these three main CNS neural cell types at postnatal ages day 1 to 30.  This database provides the first global characterization of the genes expressed by mammalian astrocytes in vivo and is the first direct comparison between the astrocyte, neuron, and oligodendrocyte transcriptomes.  We demonstrate that Aldh1L1, a highly expressed astrocyte gene, is a highly specific antigenic marker for astrocytes with a substantially broader, and therefore potentially more useful, pattern of astrocyte expression than the traditional astrocyte marker GFAP.  This transcriptome database of acutely isolated and highly pure populations of astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes provides a resource to the neuroscience community by providing improved cell type specific markers and for better understanding of neural development, function, and disease. We acutely purified mouse astrocytes from early postnatal ages (P1) to later postnatal ages (P30), when astrocyte differentiation is morphologically complete (Bushong et al., 2004), and acutely purified mouse OL-lineage cells from stages ranging from OPCs to newly differentiated OLs to myelinating OLs.  We extracted RNA from each of these highly purified, acutely isolated cell types and used GeneChip Arrays to determine the expression levels of over 20,000 genes and construct a comprehensive database of cell type specific gene expression in the mouse forebrain.  Analysis of this database confirms cell type specific expression of many well characterized and functionally important genes.  In addition, we have identified thousands of new cell type enriched genes, thereby providing important new information about astrocyte, OL, and neuron interactions, metabolism, development, and function.  This database provides a comparison of the genome-wide transcriptional profiles of the main CNS cell types and is a resource to the neuroscience community for better understanding the development, physiology, and pathology of the CNS. Keywords: Developmental CNS Cell type comparision FACS purification of astrocytes: Dissociated forebrains from S100  -EGFP mice were resuspended in panning buffer (DBPS containing 0.02% BSA and 12.5 U/ml DNase) and sequentially incubated on the following panning plates: secondary antibody only plate to deplete microglia, O4 plate to deplete OLs, PDGFR   plate to deplete OPCs, and a second O4 plate to deplete any remaining OLs.  This procedure was sufficient to deplete all OL-lineage cells from animals P8 and younger, however, in older animals that had begun to myelinate, additional depletion of OLs and myelin debris was accomplished as follows.  The nonadherent cells from the last O4 dish were harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in panning buffer containing GalC, MOG, and O1 supernatant and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature.  The cell suspension was washed and then resuspended in panning buffer containing 20   g donkey anti-mouse APC for 15 minutes.  The cells were washed and resuspended in panning buffer containing propidium iodide (PI).  EGFP+ astrocytes were then purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).  Dead cells were gated out using high PI staining and forward light scatter.  Astrocytes were identified based on high EGFP fluorescence and negative APC fluorescence from indirect immunostaining for OL markers GalC, MOG, and O1.  Cells were sorted twice and routinely yielded >99.5% purity based on reanalysis of double sorted cells.; FACS purification of neurons: EGFP- cells were the remaining forebrain cells after microglia, OLs, and astrocytes had been removed, and were primarily composed of neurons, and to a lesser extent, endothelial cells (we estimate < 4% endothelial cells at P7 and < 20% endothelial cells at P17).  EGFP- cells from S100  -EGFP dissociated forebrain were FACS purified in parallel with astrocyte purification and were sorted based on their negative EGFP fluorescence immunofluorescence.  Cells were sorted twice and routinely yielded >99.9% purity.  In independent preparations, the EGFP- cell population was additionally depleted of endothelial cells and pericytes by sequentially labeling with biotin-BSL1 lectin and streptavidin-APC while also labeling for OL markers as described above.  Cells were sorted twice and routinely yielded >99.9% purity.; Panning purification of oligodendrocyte lineage cells: Dissociated mouse forebrains were resuspended in panning buffer.  In order to deplete microglia, the single-cell suspension was sequentially panned on four BSL1 panning plates.  The cell suspension was then sequentially incubated on two PDGFR   plates (to purify and deplete OPCs), one A2B5 plate (to deplete any remaining OPCs), two MOG plates (to purify and deplete myelinating OLs), and one GalC plate (to purify the remaining PDGFR  -, MOG-, OLs).  The adherent cells on the first PDGFR  , MOG, and GalC plates were washed to remove all antigen-negative nonadherent cells.  The cells were then lysed while still attached to the panning plate with Qiagen RLT lysis buffer, and total RNA was purified.  Purified OPCs were >95% NG2 positive and 0% MOG positive.  Purified Myelin OLs were 100% MOG positive, >95% MBP positive, and 0% NG2 positive.  Purified GalC OLs depleted of OPCs and Myelin OLs were <10% MOG positive and ~50% weakly NG2 positive, a reflection of their recent development as early OLs.; Data normalization and analysis: Raw image files were processed using Affymetrix GCOS and the MAS 5.0 algorithm.  Intensity data was normalized per chip to a target intensity TGT value of 500, and expression data and absent/present calls for individual probe sets were determined.  Gene expression values were normalized and modeled across arrays using the dChip software package with invariant-set normalization and a PM model. (www.dchip.org, Li and Wong, 2001).  The 29 samples were grouped into 9 sample types: Astros P7-P8, Astros P17, Astros P17-gray matter (P17g), Neurons P7, Neurons P17, Neurons-endothelial cell depleted (P7n, P17n), OPCs, GalC-OLs, and MOG-OLs.  Gene filtering was performed to select probe sets that were consistently expressed in at least one cell type, where consistently expressed was defined as being called present and having a MAS 5.0 intensity level greater than 200 in at least two-thirds of the samples in the cell type.  We identified 20,932 of the 45,037 probe sets that were consistently expressed in at least one of the nine cell types.  The Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) method (Tusher et al., 2001) was used to determine genes that were significantly differentially expressed between different cell types (see Supplemental Table S2 for SAM cell type groupings).  Clustering was performed using the hclust method with complete linkage in R.  Expression values were transformed for clustering by computing a mean expression value for the gene using those samples in the corresponding SAM statistical analysis, and then subtracting the mean from expression intensities.  In order to preserve the log2 scale of the data, unless otherwise indicated, no normalization by variance was performed.  Plots were created using the gplots package in R.  The Bioconductor software package (Gentleman et al., 2004) was used throughout the expression analyses.  Functional analyses were performed through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity   Systems, www.ingenuity.com). ..

All aspects of the panning and FACS purification procedures are summarized below.;  Preparation Of Mouse Forebrain Cell Suspensions: Six to eight mice from a wild-type litter (C57BL/6, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) or S100?-EGFP transgenic litter (C57BL/6 x DBA (F1), Kosmos line, Zuo et al., 2004) were used.  The forebrain was isolated by removal of the olfactory lobes, cerebellum, and midbrain/hindbrain structures by crude dissection, and the tissue was diced with a curved-blade surgical scalpel (Feather, Osaka, Japan, GRF-2976 #10).  To isolate cerebral cortical gray matter astrocytes, the brain was sliced in 2-3 mm coronal sections and the cerebral cortex was carefully dissected away from the ventral white matter tracks.  This tissue was enzymatically dissociated to make a suspension of single cells, essentially as described by Huettner and Baughman (Huettner and Baughman, 1986; Segal et al., 1998).  Briefly, the tissue was incubated at 33 ?C for 80 minutes (90 minutes for animals P16 and older) in 20 ml of a papain solution (20 U/ml, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, LS03126) prepared in dissociation buffer with EDTA (0.5 mM), and L-cysteine-HCl (necessary to activate the papain, 1 mM, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, C7880).  The dissociation buffer contained Earle?s balanced salts (EBSS, Sigma, E7510), D(+)-glucose (22.5 mM), NaHCO3 (26 mM), and DNase (125U/ml, Worthington, LS002007) and requires careful equilibration with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 gas before use and during papain treatment.  When dissociation buffer is exposed to room air during trituration, minimizing surface area and avoiding bubbles is essential to maintain the proper pH and cell health.;  After papain treatment to loosen contacts in the extracellular matrix, the tissue was washed with 3 x 4 ml dissociation buffer containing BSA (1.0 mg/ml, Sigma, A-8806) and ovomucoid (also known as Trypsin Inhibitor, 1.0 mg/ml, Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN, 109878) (inhibitor solution) and then mechanically dissociated by gentle sequential trituration using a 5 ml pipette with 5 x 4 ml fresh inhibitor solution to yield a suspension of single cells.  Dissociated cells were layered on top of 12 ml of concentrated inhibitor solution (5 mg/ml BSA and 5 mg/ml ovomucoid) and harvested by centrifugation (140 x g for 5 minutes, 220 x g for 10 minutes when purifying OL lineage cells).  This method routinely yielded ~15-20 million cells per mouse pup forebrain, with excellent cell health as determined by morphology and viability (>90% by trypan blue exclusion).;

We aimed to study brain transcriptional response to seizure and to identify genes whose expression is altered after nicotine-induced seizures. Whole brains of untreated mice were compared to brains one hour after seizure activity, using Affymetrix U74Av2 microaarays. Experimental groups included wild-type mice and both nicotine-induced seizures sensitive and resistant nAChR mutant mice. Each genotype group received different nicotine doses to generate seizures. This approach allowed the identification of significantly changed genes whose expression was dependent on seizure activity, nicotine administration or both, but not on the type of nAChR subunit mutation or the amount of nicotine injected. Significant expression changes were detected in 62 genes (p < 0.05, FDR correction). Among them, GO functional annotation analysis determined that the most significantly over-represented categories were of genes encoding MAP kinase phosphatases, regulators of transcription and nucleosome assembly proteins. In-silico bioinformatic analysis of the promoter regions of the 62 changed genes detected the significant enrichments of 16 transcription regulatory elements (TREs), creating a network of transcriptional regulatory responses to seizures. The TREs for ATF and SRF were most significantly enriched, supporting their association with seizure activity. Our data suggest that nicotine-induced seizure in mice is a useful model to study seizure activity and its global brain transcriptional response. The differentially expressed genes detected here can help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying seizures in animal models, and may also serve as candidate genes to study epilepsy in humans. Keywords: treatment, seizure activity, genotypes Whole brain expression profiles were determined in two experimental groups of mice, sixteen mice that were not treated with nicotine and twelve mice one hour after experiencing nicotine-induced seizure. The untreated group included six wild-type mice, five alpha7+/T and five beta4-/- mice. The group of mice that underwent nicotine-induced seizures included three wild-types, five alpha7+/T and four beta4-/- mice. Different doses of nicotine were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to each genotype group of mice in order to achieve a similar seizure score in all three genotypes. .. 6 weeks;  7 weeks;  8 weeks;  9 weeks;  F;  M;  C57BL/6J;  1 hour following nicotine-induced seizures;  untreated;  total RNA;  Alpha7 L250T heterozygous mice following nicotine-induced seizures;  Alpha7 nAChR subunit L250T heterozygous mice without treatment;  Beta4 nAChR subunit null mice following nicotine-induced seizures;  Beta4 nAChR subunit null mice without treatment;  Wild-type mice following nicotine-induced seizures;  Wild-type mice without treatment;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in and full-length transgenic models of HD took longer to appear, 15- and 22-month CHL2(Q150/Q150), 18-month Hdh(Q92/Q92) and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. Whereas it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared with those caused by the expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. In addition, very high correlations between the signatures of mice expressing normal levels of wild-type huntingtin and mice in which the wild-type protein is absent suggest a limited effect of the wild-type protein to change basal gene expression or to influence the qualitative disease-related effect of mutant huntingtin. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides important temporal and mechanistic insights into the process by which mutant huntingtin kills striatal neurons. In addition, the discovery that several available lines of HD mice faithfully recapitulate the gene expression signature of the human disorder provides a novel aspect of validation with respect to their use in preclinical therapeutic trials.

We used microarray analysis to study the gene groups coordinately expressed temporally during mouse a liver regeneration. One of the syn-expression groups that showed a sharp rise in gene expression immediately after hepatectomy contains a set pancreatic exocrine genes. The syn-expression profile of pancreatic genes and the pancreatic-specific transcription factors Ptf1a and Ipf1 was confirmed using real-time PCR. Electron microscopic examination showed the presence of morphological features reminiscent of pancreatic acinar cells with the presence of characteristic zymogen granules and ER organization. These results indicate that there is a transient liver-to-pancreas transdifferentiation event at the beginning of liver regeneration. A strong coordinated up-regulation of pancreatic genes was found to accompany the injury response in the pancreas, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for pancreatic functions. There seems to be a relationship between the induction of pancreatic genes and acute phase response at the beginning of liver regeneration.

Whole brain expression analyses after 6h sleep deprivation clearly indicate that Homer1a is the best index of sleep need, consistently in all mouse strains analyzed. Transgenic mice expressing a FLAG-tagged poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) under the control of Homer1a promoter were generated. Because PABP binds the poly(A) tails of mRNA, affinity purification of FLAG-tagged PABP proteins from whole brain lysates, is expected to co-precipitate all mRNAs from neurons expressing Homer1a. Three other activity-induced genes (Ptgs2, Jph3, and Nptx2) were identified by this technique to be over-expressed after sleep loss. All four genes play a role in recovery from glutamate-induced neuronal hyperactivity. The consistent activation of Homer1a suggests a role for sleep in intracellular calcium homeostasis for protecting and recovering from the neuronal activation imposed by wakefulness. Keywords: sleep deprivation, neuronal subpopulation transcriptome Experiments were performed on male mice, 12 weeks of age +/- 1 week. Animals were housed in polycarbonate cages (31x18x18cm) in an experimental room with an ambient temperature varying from 23   to 25  C under a 12:12 hrs light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. At light onset mice were either sleep deprived by gentle handling (n=10) or left undisturbed (n=10) for 6 hrs. Animals were then randomly sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Total RNA from the whole brain was isolated for control (n=4) and sleep deprived (n=4)  using a commercial RNA extraction kit (RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit, Quiagen). Specific Homer1a-expressing cells polyA RNAs were immunoprecipitated following the total brain crosslinking (1% formaldehyde perfusion)  for sleep deprived (n=6) and control (n=6) animals. The total RNA from the pull-down supernatants were also harvested (n=4). To test for transcriptional changes after sleep deprivation Homer1a-expressing cells, we proceeded in 2 steps: (1) identify probe sets enriched in the pull-down extracts, (2) among those probe sets compare sleep deprivation to control condition in both pull-down (6 vs. 6 chip comparison) and whole-brain (4 vs. 4 chip comparison) extracts. 4728 probe sets were significantly enriched at 5% FDR when pull-downs were compared to both supernatant and whole-brain extracts. .. mRNAs pull-down, control;  mRNAs pull-down,sleep deprivation;  total RNA pull-down supernatant, control;  total RNA pull-down supernatant, sleep deprivation;  total RNA, control;  total RNA, sleep deprivation;  polyA RNA;  total RNA;  Homer1a expressing cells, 6hrs sleep deprivation;  Homer1a expressing cells, control;  Homer1a negative cells, 6 hrs sleep deprivation;  Homer1a negative cells,control;  Whole brain, 6 hrs sleep deprivation;  Whole brain, control;  10090;  Mus musculus;  At light onset, animals were either sleep deprived by gentle handling or left undisturbed for 6 hrs.;

Gene expression observed in these models likely includes both developmental gene expression patterns and regenerative responses to axotomy, which occurs as the result of tissue dissection.  Comparison across both models revealed many genes with similar gene expression patterns during neurite outgrowth.  These patterns were minimally affected by exposure to the potent inhibitory cue Semaphorin3A, indicating that this extrinsic cue does not exert major effects at the level of nuclear transcription.  We also compared our data to several published studies of DRG and SCG gene expression in animal models of regeneration, and found the expression of a large number of genes in common between neurite outgrowth in vitro and regeneration in vivo. Keywords: time course We wished to determine the transcriptional profiles of neurons undergoing neurite outgrowth in vitro.

Here we present a mouse model of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that recapitulates changes in the non-malignant circulating T cells seen in patients with this illness.1 To validate this model, we examined changes in T cell gene expression, protein expression and function in Em-TCL1 transgenic mice as they developed CLL 2,3 and demonstrate that development of CLL in these transgenic mice is associated with changes in impaired T cell function and in gene expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells similar to those observed in patients with this disease. Infusion of CLL cells into non-leukemia bearing Em-TCL1 mice rapidly induces these changes, demonstrating a causal relationship between leukemia and the induction of T cell changes. This model allows dissection of the molecular changes induced in CD4 and CD8 T cells by interaction with leukemia cells and further supports the concept that cancer results in complex abnormalities in the immune microenvironment. Gene expression profiling was performed to determine whether Em-TCL1 murine model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) mimics T cell defects induced by CLL cells in patients with CLL.

In murine small intestine ICC are gathered in the region of the myenteric plexus (ICC-MY) and within the deep-muscular plexus near the submucosal surface of the circular muscle layer (ICC-DMP).  These two classes of ICC have different physiological functions. ICC-MY are pacemaker cells and generate the slow wave electrical rhythmicity of gastrointestinal organs.  ICC-DMP form synaptic connections with the varicose nerve terminals of enteric motor neurons and are involved in reception and transduction of motor neurotransmission.

The mechanism behind this action is unknown. We have previously generated transgenic mice (TG) expressing human wild-type FGF23 under the control of the   1 (I) collagen promoter. In this study we performed a large scale gene expression study of kidneys from TG mice and wild-type littermates. Several genes that play a role in Pi regulation had decreased expression levels, such as Npt2a, but also Pdzk1 which is a scaffolding protein known to interact with NPT2a. Importantly, the Klotho gene, a suggested crucial co-factor for FGF23 receptor binding and activation, was the most affected decreased gene. However, other genes proposed to regulate Pi levels, such as secreted Frizzled Related Protein 4 (sFRP4), Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) and the FGF-receptors 1-4, revealed no changes. Interestingly, expression levels of inflammatory response genes were increased and histological analysis revealed tubular nephropathy in the TG mice kidneys. In conclusion, FGF23 TG mice have altered kidney gene expression levels of several genes thought to be part of Pi homeostasis and an increase in inflammatory response genes, data supported by histological analysis. These findings may lead to further understanding of how FGF23 mediates its actions on renal Pi regulation.

Our objective was to identify a mouse model of breast cancer stem cells that could have relevance to studying human breast cancer. To do so, we utilized breast tumors of the MMTVWnt-1 mice. MMTV-Wnt-1 breast tumors were harvested, dissociated into single cell suspensions, and FACS sorted on Thy1, CD24, and CD45. FACS sorted cells were then injected into recipient background FBV/NJ female mice. Thy1+CD24+ cancer cells, which constitute approximately 1-4% of tumor cells were highly enriched for cells capable of regenerating new tumors when compared to cells of the tumor that did not fit this profile (   Not Thy1+CD24+   ). Resultant tumors were of the same phenotypic diversity as the original tumor and behaved in a similar manner when passaged. Microarray analysis comparing Thy1+CD24+ tumor cells to    Not Thy1+CD24+    cells identified a list of differentially expressed genes. Orthologs of these differentially expressed genes predicted survival of human breast cancer patients from two different study groups.

Here, we generated a skeletal muscle-specific, conditional transgenic mouse expressing a constitutively-active form of Akt1. Transgene activation led to muscle hypertrophy due to the growth of type IIb muscle fibers, which was accompanied by an increase in strength. These mice were then used to assess the consequence of building fast/glycolytic muscle fibers on adiposity and metabolism. Akt1 transgene induction in obese mice resulted in reductions in body weight and fat mass, a resolution of hepatic steatosis and improved metabolic parameters. These effects were achieved independent of changes in physical activity and levels of food consumption.  Akt1-mediated skeletal muscle growth opposed the effects of high fat/sucrose diet on transcript expression patterns in the liver, and increased hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production. Our findings indicate that an increase in fast/glycolytic muscle mass can result in the regression of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders in part through its ability to alter fatty acid metabolism in remote tissues.

However, current knowledge on the involvement of Akt signaling in development is limited. Previous data have suggested that Akt-mediated signaling may be an essential mediator of epidermal homeostasis through cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Here we report the developmental consequences of deregulated Akt activity in the basal layer of stratified epithelia, mediated by the expression of a constitutively active Akt1 (myrAkt) in transgenic mice. Contrary to mice overexpressing wilt type Akt1 (Aktwt), these myrAkt mice display, in a dose-dependent manner, altered development of ectodermally derived organs such as hair, teeth, nails and epidermal glands. To identify the possible molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations, gene profiling approaches were employed. We demonstrate that constitutive Akt activity disturbs the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-dependent signaling pathway, which leads to alterations in adult epidermal stem cells. Collectively, we show that epithelial tissue development and homeostasis is dependent on proper regulation of Akt expression and activity.

The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity. Genetic disruption of JNK1, but not JNK2, improves insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. We applied RNA interference to investigate the specific role of hepatic JNK1 in contributing to insulin resistance in DIO mice. Adenovirus-mediated delivery of JNK1 short-hairpin RNA (Ad-shJNK1) resulted in almost complete knockdown of hepatic JNK1 protein without affecting JNK1 protein in other tissues. Liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 resulted in significant reductions in circulating insulin and glucose levels, by 57 and 16%, respectively. At the molecular level, JNK1 knockdown mice had sustained and significant increase of hepatic Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, knockdown of JNK1 enhanced insulin signaling in vitro. Unexpectedly, plasma triglyceride levels were robustly elevated upon hepatic JNK1 knockdown. Concomitantly, expression of proliferator-activated receptor  coactivator 1, glucokinase, and microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein was increased. Further gene expression analysis demonstrated that knockdown of JNK1 up-regulates the hepatic expression of clusters of genes in glycolysis and several genes in triglyceride synthesis pathways. Our results demonstrate that liver-specific knockdown of JNK1 lowers circulating glucose and insulin levels but increases triglyceride levels in DIO mice.

Catenin, the central signal transducer of the Wnt pathway, can directly modulate gene expression by interacting with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF-family. In the present study we investigate the role of Wnt signaling in the homeostasis of intestinal epithelium using tissue-specific, inducible beta-catenin gene ablation in adult mice. Block of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling resulted in rapid loss of transient-amplifying cells and crypt structures. Importantly, intestinal stem cells were induced to terminally differentiate upon deletion of beta-catenin resulting in a complete block of intestinal homeostasis and fatal loss of intestinal function. Transcriptional profiling of mutant crypt mRNA isolated by laser capture micro dissection confirmed those observations and allowed to identify genes potentially responsible for the functional preservation of intestinal stem cells.

This process is mediated through a classical multistep mechanism which involves transient rolling on the endothelium and recognition of inflammation followed by extravasation. We show here, by direct examination of blood monocyte functions in vivo, that resident monocytes monitor the endothelium of healthy tissues through patrolling, a new mechanism which allows extravasation in the absence of rolling.Patrolling depends on the integrin LFA1 and the chemokine receptor CX3CR1, and is required for rapid tissue invasion and initiation of an early immune response by monocytes that differentiate into macrophages at the site of tissue damage and infection. The main goal of the experiment was to compare expression levels of genes in Gr1- monocytes in the blood and after recruitment in the peritoneum during experimental infection with Listeria monocytogenes (time course analysis).

A substantial number of the identified HOXB4 target genes are involved in signaling pathways important for controlling self-renewal, maintenance and differentiation of stem cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HOXB4 activity and FGF-signaling are intertwined. HOXB4-mediated expansion of ES cell-derived early progenitors was enhanced by specific and complete inhibition of FGF-receptors. In contrast, the expanding activity of HOXB4 on hematopoietic progenitors in day4-6 embryoid bodies was blunted in the presence of basic FGF (FGF2) indicating a dominant negative effect of FGF-signaling on the earliest hematopoietic cells. Taken together, we show that modulation of FGF signaling is an essential feature of HOXB4 activity in the context of embryonic hematopoiesis. Keywords: plus/minus induction of HOXB4 gene expression by treatment with doxycycline (Dox) The Hoxb4i ES cell line (Kyba et al. 2002, Cell 109:29-37) contains an integrated    tet-on    cassette that allows induction of HOXB4 expression upon treatment with doxycycline. These ES cells can be used to produce hematopoietic cells through the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs). Hematopoiesis starts in these EBs at day 4 and the differentiation into hematopoietic fates can be quantified by colony assays on methyl-cellulose using cells dissociated from EBs at day 6 of incubation. The induction of HOXB4 by incubation with doxycycline increases the production of hematopoietic progenitors within EBs by day 6. Using this specific ES cell line, we compared the transcriptome between embryoid bodies (EBs) in which transcription of HOXB4 had been induced or not induced from day 4 to day 6 (48hours).Biological replicates: 3 ..

In an attempt to further examine the exosome-mediated cellular communication, we show that exosomes from a mouse mast cell line (MC/9), exosomes from primary bone marrow derived mast cells, and exosomes from a human mast cell line (HMC-1) contain RNA but not DNA. Microarray assessments of exosome-derived RNA revealed that these vesicles contain mRNA from approximately 1200 genes, many of which are unique and not present in the cytoplasmic RNA pool in the donor cell.

The main objective of this study was to investigate cardiogenesis in cultures of differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and to determine how closely it mimics in vivo cardiac development. We identified and isolated a population of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) through the use of a reporter DNA construct that allowed the expression of a selectable marker under the control of the Nkx2.5 enhancer. We proceeded to characterize these CPCs by examining their capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes and to proliferate. We then performed a large-scale temporal microarray expression analysis in order to identify genes that are uniquely upregulated or downregulated in the CPC population. We determined that the transcriptional profile of the mESC derived CPCs was consistent with pathways known to be active during embryonic cardiac development. We conclude that in vitro differentiation of mESCs recapitulates the early steps of mouse cardiac development.  Keywords: embryonic stem cell, differentiation, cardiac progenitor, cardiogenesis Cell culture and cell differentiationMouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were maintained undifferentiated by culturing on a feeder layer of mitomycin C pretreated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEFs, Specialty Media, cat.# PMEF-H) at 37oC, 90% humidity and 5% CO2. The cell line used was the mESC D3 (passage #12-18). The basic culture medium was comprised of DMEM (Invitrogen, cat.# 11965-092), heat inactivated (56oC for 30 minutes) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, cat#. S11550, 15%), Glutamax (Invitrogen, cat.# 35050-065, 1%), non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen, cat.# 11140-050, 1%), sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen, cat.# 11360-070, 1%), ?-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, cat.# M7522, 0.1mM), gentamicin (Cambrex, cat.# 17-518, 25?g/ml) and ESGRO leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, cat.# ESG1106, 1000units/ml). Prior to initiation of differentiation The PMEF feeder layer was subtracted and the mESCs were maintained on a 0.01% gelatin pretreated plate for 24-48 hours. Differentiation through embryoid body (EB) formation was initiated by dissociating the mESCs using trypsin (Invitrogen, cat#. 25300-054, 0.05%) and resuspending them in basic culture medium (without the leukemia inhibitory factor) at a final concentration of 5x104 cells/ml. The hanging droplet (HD) technique was used for EB formation. HDs were plated on the lid of H2O containing tissue culture dishes at a volume of 20?L/droplet (approximately 1000 cells/ droplet). Two days post initiation of differentiation the EBs were transferred in suspension on poly-HEMA (Sigma, cat#. P3932) treated tissue culture dishes. The plates were pretreated with poly-HEMA in order to avoid any cell attachment on the plastic. Basic culture medium was supplemented with ascorbic acid(Takahashi et al., 2003) (Sigma, cat#. A4403, 0.1mg/ml) and it was exchanged with fresh medium every 2 days during differentiation. Transfection of mouse embryonic stem cellsThe mouse Nkx2.5 enhancer fragment #5(Lien et al., 1999) and the hsp68 minimal promoter was excised from the provided vector (XhoI/ NcoI) and inserted in front of the EGFP gene in the Bluescript vector. A vector containing the hygromycin resistance gene (hygromycin phosphotransferase) under the control of the mouse polymerase II promoter was also used in order to select for the transfected mESCs. Prior to transfection the two vectors were linearized. Undifferentiated mESCs were grown to confluency on a layer of primary embryonic fibroblasts and dissociated with trypsin. The cells were combined with the linearized DNA and electroporated (Biorad Gene Pulser Xcell, 240V/ 500?F). The cells were then replated on a fresh layer of PMEFs. Hygromycin B (Invitrogen, cat.# 10687-010, 50?g/ml) was used for 7 days after transfection for selection. Resistant colonies were picked and grown on layers of PMEFs in the presence of antibiotic. Once sufficient cells were present the clones were differentiated in order to check for the correct expression of the GFP in the cardiac areas (spontaneously contracting) of the differentiating cultures. Successful clones were further amplified and used for characterization of the GFP expressing cardiac progenitor cells.In order to select mESC derived cardiomyocytes for the microarray analysis experiment, a stable transgenic clone of mESCs was made that allowed the expression of the neomycin resistance gene under the control of the alpha myosin heavy chain promoter (U71441) as described by Klug et al., (Klug et al., 1996). The transgenic clone was prepared as described above.  FACS AnalysisFor determination of the CPC yield in the differentiating cells, EBs were harvested at the indicated timepoints (between days 6 and 10 of differentiation). Each sample contained approximately 100 hanging droplets on day 0 of differentiation. The EBs were washed in PBS and resuspended in 0.05% trypsin at 4oC (1/2 hour) and 37oC (10 minutes). The percentage of GFP+ cells was determined in a BD FACS Calibur (Cell Quest Pro software). Age matched EBs from untransfected mESCs were used as negative controls. Cells from the same samples were also counted.FACS sortingThe BD Biosciences FACSAria Cell sorting system was used to sort the GFP+ and GFP- cells between days 5 and 10 of differentiation. EBs were harvested and dissociated as described above. The cells were suspended in sorting medium (96% DMEM without phenol red, 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% Glutamax, 1% non essential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 25?g/ml gentamicin) and kept at 4oC. The cells were sorted into a fetal bovine serum rich medium (20%) in order to increase their survival. For further culture the cells were resuspended in mESC culture medium at a concentration of 5x105 cells/ml and cultured in suspension for 48 hours. The cells were then transferred on tissue culture plates for another 48 hours. For RNA isolation the cells were spun down and washed in PBS before the RNA isolation procedure.To assay their proliferation capacity, GFP+ CPCs were FACS sorted on day 5 of differentiation. Cells were reaggregated in suspension (5x105 cells/ ml) in the presence of mouse recombinant Igf1 (Chemicon, Cat.# GF121, 100ng/ml) for 14 days. Cell aggregates were fixed and stained for the colocalization of the antigens: Nkx2-5 and Ki67 or Pcna. The same ICC reagents were used as described above. GeneChip microarray hybridizationTotal RNA for the microarray expression analysis was isolated from FACS sorted cells (GFP+ and GFP-) on days 5, 6, 7, and 8 of differentiation as described above. Two separate differentiation batches were prepared for the sake of data reproducibility. Total RNA was also isolated from terminally differentiated mESC derived genetically selected cardiomyocytes 3 weeks post initiation of differentiation. The GeneChip   two cycle target labeling kit (Affymetrix, cat.# 900494) was used to convert 100ng of total RNA to biotinylated labeled cRNA. This was then hybridized to the Affymetrix murine MOE430 2.0 genome GeneChip   array (Affymetrix, cat.# 900496). Fluorescence was detected using the Affymetrix GS3000 GeneArray scanner and image analysis for each chip was done through the GeneChip   operating system software from Affymetrix (GCOS1.3) using the standard default settings.Microarray data analysisTo estimate the gene expression signals, data analysis was conducted on the chips    CEL file probe signal values at the Affymetrix probe pair (perfect match (PM) probe and mismatch (MM) probe) level, using the statistical technique RMA (Robust Multiarray Analysis) (Irizarry et al., 2003) with the bioconductor package Affy. The data normalization procedure utilized the quantile normalization method (Bolstad et al., 2003) to reduce the obscuring variation between microarrays, which might be introduced during the processes of sample preparation, manufacture, fluorescence labeling, hybridization and/or scanning.The Spotfire DecisionSite software package was used for the identification of uniquely upregulated or downregulated (at least 1.5 times increase or decrease in the expression value) probe sets in the CPC population when compared to the rest of the cells in the differentiating EBs. Probe sets that were considered unique for the CPC population were found to be commonly upregulated or downregulated during all four days of analysis. Probe sets that exhibited an increasing or decreasing pattern of expression with at least 1.5 times increase or decrease in the expression values of day 5 CPCs and day 8 CPCs were also reported. Probe sets of the CPC population that exhibited upregulation or downregulation by at least 1.5 times when compared to the mESC derived cardiomyocytes were also reported. The final analysis included probe sets that exhibited a different temporal pattern of expression in the CPC population when compared to the rest of the cells along the four days of differentiation. Specifically in order to identify these probe sets gene expression curve over time was modeled flexibly ..

Somatic inactivation of LKB1 occurs in human lung adenocarcinoma2-4, but its tumor suppressor role in this tissue is unknown.  Here we show that somatic Lkb1 deficiency strongly cooperates with somatic K-rasG12D activating mutation to accelerate the development of mouse lung tumorigenesis.  Lkb1 deficiency in the setting of K-rasG12D mutation (K-ras Lkb1L/L) was associated with decreased tumor latency and increased tumor aggressiveness including metastasis.  Furthermore, tumors from K-ras Lkb1L/L mice demonstrated histologies--squamous, adenosquamous and large cell--not seen with K-rasG12D mutation, Ink4a/Arf inactivation, or p53 inactivation alone or in combination.  Experiments in vitro suggest that LKB1 suppresses lung tumorigenesis and progression through both p16INK4a-ARF-p53 dependent and independent mechanisms.

While the mechanisms connecting histone lysine methylation to effector protein recruitment and control of gene activity are increasingly well understood, it remains unknown whether non-histone chromatin proteins are targets for similar modification-recognition systems. Here we show that histone H3 and the H3 methyltransferase G9a share a conserved methylation motif that is both necessary and sufficient to mediate in vivo interaction with the potent epigenetic regulator Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1). As with H3, G9a-HP1 interaction is dependent on lysine methylation and can be reversed by adjacent phosphorylation. NMR analysis demonstrates that the HP1 chromodomain recognizes methyl-G9a through a binding mode similar to that used in recognition of methyl-H3, and that adjacent phosphorylation directly antagonizes G9a-HP1 interaction. In addition to uncovering the chromodomain as a generalized methyl-lysine binding module, these data identify histone-like modification cassettes (or    histone mimics   ) as an entirely new class of non-histone methylation targets, and directly demonstrate the relevance of the principles underlying the histone code to the regulation of non-histone proteins.

Our results indicate that the latter is more likely. We identified 21 genes that were significantly differentially regulated, either on comparison with the pooled control, or on direct comparison of individual ES cell line data from different slides. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR on 3 separate isolates from each cell line, we have confirmed 4 of these genes as consistently differentially regulated, Hprt, and 3 others. We would conclude therefore that different ES cell lines at the same passage number in identical culture conditions show very similar expression profiles. Keywords: cell type comparison Cardiff University Array Facility NIA 15K slides were used in conjunction with 3 different RNA isolates from each of the ES cell lines. A pooled control was assembled using equal quantities of cells from each cell line, RNA was extracted and labelled, for use on every slide.

In particular, TGF-beta can activate pro- or anti-apoptotic signals depending on the target cells. We found that blockage of JNK activation sensitized mouse B lymphoma derived A20 cells to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that TGF-beta activate JNK to inhibit the activation of death signal that is simultaneously activated by TGF-beta. We used microarrays to gain insight into the effects of JNK inhibition on gene expression in TGF-b-stimulated A20 cells and identified JNK-dependent TGF-beta inducible genes. Keywords: time course The following six samples were prepared: untreated A20 cells (non-stimulated, DMSO): A20 cells cultured with SP600125 for 24 h (non-stimulated, SP600125):  A20 cells stimulated with TGF-beta for 12 h (TGF-beta 12 h, DMSO) and 24 h (TGF-beta 24 h, DMSO): and A20 cells stimulated with TGF-beta in the presence of SP600125 for 12 h (TGF-beta 12 h, SP600125) and 24 h (TGF-beta 24 h, SP600125), respectively. Total RNA was prepared and hybridized to the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array. Genes whose expression was increased by more than 2-fold at either 12 or 24 h after TGF-beta stimulation were identified as TGF-beta inducible genes.

However, not all obese patients have the same risk of developing these disorders. Individuals with peripheral obesity, i.e., fat distributed subcutaneously, are at little or no risk of the common medical complications of obesity, whereas individuals with central obesity, i.e., fat accumulated in visceral depots, are prone to these complications. In the present study, using microaarays gene expression, we have explored the hypothesis that patterns of fat distribution and, perhaps, to some degree, obesity itself may have a developmental genetic origin.

Here we use microarrays and mass spectrometry to study the transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the striatum of two mouse models of PD induced by distinct neurotoxins, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and  methamphetamine (METH).  Transcripts and proteins were found with similar abundance changes in both models which may be involved in the pathophysiology of PD.  GFAP transcript and protein levels were significantly up-regulated by both neurotoxins, confirming the known astrocytic response to these drugs.  Other genes and proteins were idiosyncratic in their responses to the two toxins, suggesting specific toxicological responses.  Comparing transcript and protein levels revealed that efficiently translated genes used more commonly occurring codons than inefficiently translated genes.  Additionally, a potential role was found for miRNAs in translational control in the striatum.  The results constitute one of the largest datasets integrating transcript and protein changes for these two neurotoxin models with many similar endpoint phenotypes but distinct pathologies.  Using multiple toxins while examining proteins and transcripts can be an effective method of delineating the molecular pathology of neurodegenerative diseases.

Success in islet transplantation-based therapies for type 1 diabetes mellitus and an extreme shortage of pancreatic islets has motivated efforts to develop renewable sources of islet-replacement tissue. Only a few attempts have been made at prospective isolation of pancreatic stem/progenitor cells, due to the lack of specific markers and the development of cell culture method. This study demonstrates the isolation of pancreatic stem/progenitor cells from the embryonic pancreas by cell sorting. RT-PCR and microarray analysis demonstrated that pancreatic stem/progenitor cells are enriched in CD133highPDGFRb- cell population. During in vivo differentiation, these cell populations have the ability for self-renewal and multipotency, including the formation of insulin-producing cells. Since the strategy is based on the cell sorting using cell surface markers common to human and rodents, it may promote strategies to derive transplantable islet-replacement tissues from human pancreatic stem/progenitor cells. Keywords: Cell type comparison A couple of total RNAs derived from the different status of PDGFRb- cells was subjected to a dual-color microarray analysis, in which the RNAs from CD133highPDGFRb- cell population was labeled with Cy3 and that of CD133negPDGFRb- cell population with Cy5 respectively. ..

It has been shown that antidepressant treatment promotes the proliferation and survival of hippocampal neurons via enhanced serotonergic signaling, but it is still unclear whether hippocampal neurogenesis is responsible for the behavioral response to antidepressants. Furthermore, a large subpopulation of patients fails to respond to antidepressant treatment due to presumed underlying genetic factors. In the present study, we have used the phenotypic and genotypic variability of inbred mouse strains to show that there is a genetic component to both the behavioral and neurogenic effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment, and that this antidepressant induces an increase in hippocampal cell proliferation only in the strains that also show a positive behavioral response to treatment. The behavioral and neurogenic responses are associated with an upregulation of genes known to promote neuronal proliferation and survival.  These results suggest that inherent genetic predisposition to increased serotonin-induced neurogenesis is a determinant of antidepressant efficacy. Keywords: drug response Male DBA/2J, age 3-5 weeks, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained on a 12:12 light:dark cycle with lights on at 0700 hours. Following at least one week of acclimation, mice were provided with either untreated or fluoxetine-treated drinking water, available ad libitum.  Fluoxetine-HCl was obtained from Spectrum Chemicals (Gardena, CA). Differences in daily water consumption were previously determined by measuring water intake for three weeks from at least 12 mice  (6.4 mL (+/- .58 mL) per day). We also determined the average weight at 10 weeks of age (25.5 g +/- 1.4 g), and used this information to dilute fluoxetine in the water in order to provide a daily dosage of 0 or 18 mg/kg/mouse. Mice were 8-12 weeks of age at the time of behavioral testing, which was performed during the light phase between 1300h and 1600h. Behavioral despair was measured using a mouse Tail Suspension apparatus from Med Associates (Georgia, VT).Individual bilateral hippocampii from 21-day-treatment 0 and 18 mg/kg/day DBA/2J mice were homogenized in 500   l TRIzol using a QIAgen Tissuelyser (15 minutes at 30 Hz, QIAgen, Chatsworth, CA). RNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform phase separation and further processed using the RNAeasy miniprep kit (QIAgen). For each treatment group of 12 animals, separate RNA pools were made using hippocampal RNA from 6 mice per pool. These biological replicates were processed separately through the entirety of the microarray procedure. Five   g of total RNA from each pool was used as a template to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) and biotinylated cRNA (Enzo kit, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using standard Affymetrix protocols. cRNA was hybridized to  Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. Data were analyzed using ArrayAssist software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and normalized with the GCRMA algorithm.

Allergic contact dermatitis affects about 5% of men and 11% of women in industrialized countries and is one of the leading causes for occupational diseases. In an animal model for cutaneous contact hypersensitivity we show that mice lacking both known cannabinoid receptors display exacerbated allergic inflammation. In contrast, fatty acid amide hydrolase deficient mice, which have increased levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide, displayed reduced allergic responses in the skin. Cannabinoid receptor antagonists exacerbated whereas receptor agonists attenuated allergic inflammation.

We hypothesized that genes critical to stem cell fate would be dynamically regulated at the initiation of commitment. Time course microarray analysis following initiation of commitment led us to propose a model of ESC maintenance in which highly regulated transcription factors and chromatin remodeling genes (down-regulated in our time course) maintain repression of genes responsible for cell differentiation, morphogenesis and development (up-regulated in our time course). Microarrays of Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 shRNA knockdown cell lines confirmed predicted regulation of target genes.  shRNA knockdowns of candidate genes were tested in a novel high throughput screen of self-renewal, confirming their role in ESC pluripotency.

The tumor frequency is increased by exposing postnatal animals to ionizing radiation at a time when their cerebella are developing. In irradiated mice engineered to express a floxed p53 allele and a Nestin-Cre transgene, tumor development can be restricted to the brain. Analysis of these animals indicated that inactivation of one or both Ink4c alleles did not affect the time of medulloblastoma onset but increased tumor invasiveness. All such tumors exhibited complete loss of function of the Patched 1 (Ptc1) gene encoding the receptor for sonic hedgehog, and many exhibited other recurrent genetic alterations, including trisomy of chromosome 6, amplification of N-Myc, modest increases in copy number of the Ccnd1 gene encoding cyclin D1, and other complex chromosomal rearrangements. In contrast, medulloblastomas arising in Ptc1+/- mice lacking one or both Ink4c alleles retained p53 function and exhibited only limited genomic instability. Nonetheless, complete inactivation of the wild type Ptc1 allele was a universal event, and trisomy of chromosome 6 was again frequent. The enforced expression of N-Myc or cyclin D1 in primary cerebellar granule neuron precursors isolated from Ink4c-/-, p53-/- mice enabled the cells to initiate medulloblastomas when injected back into the brains of immunocompromised recipient animals. These engineered tumors exhibited gene expression profiles indistinguishable from those of medulloblastomas that arose spontaneously. These results underscore the functional interplay between a network of specific genes that recurrently contribute to medulloblastoma formation. Keywords: disease state analysis 5 samples, 2 states ..

Keywords: Comparative, exposure dosage, C57BI6 Murine Irradiation Studies We have made use of gene expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB MNCs) to develop expression profiles that accurately reflect prior radiation exposure. Importantly, we demonstrate that expression profiles can be developed that not only predict radiation exposure in mice but also distinguish the level of radiation exposure, ranging from 50 cGy to 1000 cGy. Likewise, a molecular signature of radiation response developed solely from irradiated human patient samples can predict and distinguish irradiated human PB samples from non-irradiated samples with an accuracy of 90%, sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 94%. We further demonstrate that a radiation profile developed in the mouse can correctly distinguish PB samples from irradiated and non-irradiated human patients with an accuracy of 77%, sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 75%. Taken together, these data demonstrate that molecular profiles can be generated which are highly predictive of different levels of radiation exposure in mice and humans.Mouse Dataset only ..

To determine how CHF1/Hey2 affects the smooth muscle response to growth factors, we performed a genomic screen for transcripts that are differentially expressed in wild type and knockout smooth muscle cells after stimulation with platelet derived growth factor. We screened 45101 probes representing more than 39,000 transcripts derived from at least 34,000 genes, at eight different time points. We analyzed the expression data utilizing an algorithm based on Bayesian statistics to derive the best polynomial clustering model to fit the expression data. We found that in a total of 9827 transcripts the normalized ratio of knockout to wild type expression diverged more than 3 fold from baseline in at least one time point, and these transcripts separated into 17 distinct clusters.

Using RNA from wild-type ES cells as our reference sample, we observed a global loss of miRNAs in DGCR8 knockout cells, but normal levels of expression in DGCR8 heterozygous cells. The similarity in expression levels between wild-type and heterozygous cells suggests that DGCR8 is not limiting in the maintenance of steady-state levels of miRNAs in ES cells.  Of the eighty-nine miRNA array probes that showed significant signals with wild-type RNA, eighty-two were drastically reduced in the DGCR8 knockout cells.  The remaining seven were not significantly altered in the DGCR8 knockout cells, but at least four of these seven miRNAs appear to be due to unavoidable contamination with RNA from the mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells used for ES cell culture prior to the isolation of RNA.  These miRNAs were highly expressed in the MEFs and decreased when the ES cells were temporarily passaged on gelatin-coated plates without feeders.  The remaining three showed similar levels of expression in the heterozygous, knockout and MEF feeder cells.  Therefore, these signals may be small RNAs that are not processed with the help of the microprocessor complex.  Alternatively, these signals may result from unavoidable degradation products within the purified small RNA population.  In either case, our results show that DGCR8 is broadly required for miRNA processing with little evidence for redundancy or bypass mechanisms.

We and others have previously demonstrated the importance of the beta-glucan receptor Dectin-1 in the recognition of pathogenic fungi by macrophages and dendritic cells, and have elucidated some of the mechanisms by which Dectin-1 signals to coordinate the antifungal response. While Dectin-1 signals alone are sufficient to trigger phagocytosis and Src-Syk-mediated induction of antimicrobial reactive oxygen species, collaboration with Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 signaling enhances NF-kB activation and regulates cytokine production. In this study we demonstrate that Dectin-1 signaling can also directly modulate gene expression via activation of nuclear transcription of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors. Dectin-1 ligation by zymosan particles or live Candida albicans yeast triggers NFAT activation in macrophages and dendritic cells. Dectin-1-triggered NFAT activation plays a role in the induction of Egr2 and Egr3 transcription factors, and cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2). Furthermore, we show that NFAT activation regulates IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 p70 production by zymosan-stimulated dendritic cells.

In order to specifically analyze mRNA transcription, a technique has been developed that can be applied in-vivo in intact cells and animals. The technique is referred with the acronym NIAC-NTR (Non Invasive Application and Capture of Newly Transcribed RNA). This method makes use of the cellular pyrimidine salvage pathway and is based on affinity-chromatographic isolation of thiolated mRNA. When combined with data on mRNA steady-state levels, this method is able to assess the relative contributions of mRNA synthesis and degradation/stabilization.

The corneal epithelium is one of the most densely innervated tissues of the body. The characteristics of the cornea are established during fetal development, and are lost in adult life when the cornea regenerates after injury. The common reaction of the cornea to injury is the formation of opaque scars, the ingrowth of blood vessels, and distinct changes in the innervation pattern. Scar formation of the cornea is critically modulated by the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). To identify genes that are important for corneal transparency, dense innervation and absence of blood vessels by comparing corneas from wildtype mice with those that are under the influence of high doses of TGF-beta. Transparency, dense innervation, and absence of blood vessels in the cornea all depend on the expression of a critical set of genes that are not expressed when TGF-beta is present. Mice were generated that overexpress TGF-beta under control of a strong lens-specific promoter. These mice developed opaque corneas that are vascularized and lack sensory nerves. In addition, these corneas were densely populated with cells expressing neural cell adhesion protein.

Therefore, we employed oligo microarrays followed by real-time RT-PCR to compare expressions of genes involved in Wnt and cadherin systems in the cerebral wall of 18-day-old (E18) fetuses from cocaine-treated (20 mg/kg cocaine, s.c., b.i.d., E8-18) and drug-naive (saline, s.c.) mice. The pregnant mice chronically treated with cocaine in the above-described manner represent one of the animal models producing offspring with widespread cortical dysplasias. Out of more than 150 relevant genes in the arrays, 32 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated in cocaine-exposed fetuses. The majority of these genes (30 out of 41) were similarly affected in the frontal and occipital regions of the cerebral wall. We also used Western immunoblotting to examine the ability of cocaine to regulate the protein levels of beta-catenin, the key functional component of both Wnt and cadherin systems. While the total cell levels of beta-catenin were increased throughout the cerebral wall of cocaine-exposed fetuses, its nuclear (gene-transcription driving) levels remained unaltered. This suggests a transcription-unrelated role for cocaine-induced upregulation of this protein. Overall, our findings point to an intriguing possibility that that cerebral cortical dysplasias observed in several animal models of prenatal cocaine exposure may be at least in part related to alterations in the Wnt/cadherin molecular network.   It has been demonstrated that exposure to cocaine increases cell death in the fetal CNS. To examine the molecular mechanisms of this effect, we employed mouse oligo microarrays followed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) to compare expressions of apoptosis-related genes in the cerebral wall of 18-day-old (E18) fetuses from cocaine-treated (20 mg/kg cocaine, s.c., b.i.d., E8th-E18th) and drug-naive (saline, s.c.) mice. Out of approximately 400 relevant genes in the arrays, 53 showed alterations in expression in cocaine-exposed fetuses. Upregulation was observed in 35 proapoptotic and 8 antiapoptotic genes; 4 proapoptotic and 6 antiapoptotic genes were down-regulated. The affected genes encode a wide range of apoptosis-related proteins, including death receptors (NTF-R1, NTF-R2, DR3, DR5, LTbeta-R, GITR, P57 TR-1) and their adaptor and regulatory proteins (MASGE-D1, TRAF-2, SIVA, MET, FLIP, FAIM, IAP1, ATFA), members of transcription regulatory pathways (JNK, NF-kappaB, P53), members of BCL-2 family of proteins (BID, BAD, BAX, BIK, NIP21, NIP3, NIX, BCL-2), DNA damage sensor (PARP-1), caspases and their substrates and regulatory proteins (caspases 8, 4, 9, and 3, ACINUS, CIDE-A, CIDE-B, GAS2), mitochondrially released factors (cytochrome c, AIF, PRG3), specific endoplasmic reticulum- and oxidative stress-associated factors (BACH2, ABL1, ALG2, CHOP), members of cell survival AKT and HSP70 pathways (PIK3GA, PTEN, HSP70, BAG1, BAG2), and others. This suggests that cocaine affects survival of developing cerebral cells via multiple apoptosis-regulating mechanisms. Keywords: Whole genome oligo microarray, Real time RT-PCR, gene expression analysis AnimalsTimed pregnant Swiss Webster (CFW; Charles RiverLab. Wilmington, MA) dams were maintained in individualcages in a climate-controlled room on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. They were divided into two groups. The first(experimental) group received subcutaneous (at the dorsumof the neck) injections of 20 mg/kg cocaine hydrochloride(Research Technology Branch, National Instituteof Drug Abuse, Rockville, MD) dissolved in 200 mkl of0.9% saline, twice a day (at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM) from8th through 18th day of pregnancy (E8   E18). The second(control) group was subjected to the same schedule of0.9% saline only injections. The cocaine treatment wasdesigned to replicate the one capable of reducing cerebralcortical mass in mouse offspring. Also, therelatively protracted period the chronic treatment waschosen to maximize the changes in the tissue expressionof cocaine-regulated genes of interest. Throughout thetreatment, all mice were weighed daily, and, from E8, thecontrol and experimental animals were pair-fed, with thedaily amount of food (Mouse Chow; Ralston Purina SaintLouis, MO) provided to each control dam being matchedto that consumed by the paired experimental dam. Waterwas available ad libitum. We found that this feedingregiment resulted in similar weight gains from E8 to E18in both experimental and control animal groups(46.41F0.45% and 44.99F0.59% respectively). On E18,1 h after the morning treatment, the animals wereanesthetized by peritoneal injection of 50 mg/kg sodiumpentobarbital (Abbott Lab., Abbott Park, IL) and theiruteri were removed. The frontal cerebral wall (containingcerebral cortex and underlying transient cortical zonesanterior to the striatal level) and the occipital cerebral wall(containing cerebral cortex and underlying transientcortical zones posterior to the level of the hippocampus)were dissected from the fetuses and stored in liquidnitrogen prior to analysis. The animal experimentationsused in this study were approved by the University ofMaryland Animal Care and Use Committee.MicroarrayTissue from two control and two experimental fetuseswere used in the processing of a single microarray slide(Part G4121A, Agilent Technol). Five slides were processedper region of the fetal cerebral wall. For a given region, thetissue for each microarray slide was obtained from aseparate set of control and experimental litters. Total RNAwas isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,CA). The yield of total RNA was determined by absorbanceat 260 nm on a DU 640 Spectrophotometer (BeckmanCoulter, Fullerton, CA). The 260/280 nm ratios of thesamples were >1.8. For each assay, 5 mkg of RNA fromcontrol tissue and 5 mkg of RNA from experimental tissuewere reverse transcribed using 3DNA Array Detection Kit(Genesphere, Hatfield, PA) with primers containing differentdcaptureT sequences for control and experimentalsamples. SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase for thesereactions was purchased from Gibco BRL (Gaithersburg,MD). The resultant cDNAs were hybridized to microarrayslides for 16 h in Agilent Hybridization Buffer (AgilentTechnol) at 60 8C. Upon completion of the hybridization,the slides were washed for 10 min with 0.005% Triton in6xsodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer (pH 7; SSC) atroom temperature and then for five more min with 0.005%Triton in 0.1xSSC and 1 more minute in 0.1xSSC (pH 7),both at 4 8C. Washed slides were air-dried for 30 s. Forfluorescent labeling of microarray-bound cDNA, the slideswere incubated for 3 h at 65 8C with Capture ReagentHybridization Mixture from 3DNA Array Detection Kit(Genesphere). In this mixture, Alexa 546 fluorochromeincorporatingdendrimers contained single-stranded armscomplimentary to the dcaptureT sequences used in thereverse transcription of RNA from control tissue, whileAlexa 647 fluorochrome-incorporating dendrimers containedarms complimentary to the capture sequences usedin reverse transcription of RNA from experimental tissue.The labeling reaction was terminated by washing of themicroarray slides at room temperature for 10 min with0.005% Triton in 2xSSC and for another 10 min with in0.2xSSC. After that, the slides were air-dried for 30 s. Theprocessed microarray slides were scanned at 10 Amresolution on a GenePix 4100A scanner (Axon Instr., UnionCity, CA) with the laser excitation at 532 nm [emission filter575DF35 (green); photomultiplier voltage 550] for Alexa546 (control samples) and the laser excitation at 635 nm[emission filter 670DF40 (red); photomultiplier voltage695] for Alexa 647 (experimental samples). The signalswere converted into 16-bits-per pixel resolution images,providing color depth of 65,536 levels. The densitometrywas performed with GenePix Pro 4.1 software (Axon Instr.).Background was subtracted using the dlocal backgroundcorrectionT procedure available in the software. Quality control utilized 255 positive controls, 161 negative controlsand 646 QC-spots present on Agilent   s arrays. Forreplicates within a slide, median signal values werecalculated. For each array, the data were normalized inAcuity 3.1 software (Axon Instr.) by applying locallyweighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) transformation.The between array scale normalizationwas done using intensity log10 ratio distribution box plots (GeneSightsoftware, BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA) for verification.Statistical analysis of the normalized data was conductedby the Significant Analyses for Microarray Algorithm(SAM) using Excel macros available at the Stanford SAM website.In the analyses of both frontal and occipital regions of the fetal cerebral wall,the cut-off thresholds were set to identify the maximumnumber of cocaine exposure-regulated genes at the minimalfalse discovery rate (FDR) allowed by SAM for a given setof microarray data. For both regions, the FDR rates were<0.5%. The apoptosis and Wnt pathway-related genes were identified with Pathway Assist 2.0 software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).This was followed by manual review of literature for eachidentified gene. ..

MyoD is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation.

(GUDMAP Series ID: 11)|The long term objective is to create an encyclopedia of the expression levels of all genes in multiple components of the developing bladder.  The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected and laser capture microdissection (LCM) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

Crypts contain intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Thus intestinal polyposis provides an ideal condition for studying stem cell involvement in polyp/tumor formation. Using a conditional knock-out mouse model, we found that the tumor suppressor Phosphatase of Tension homolog (PTEN) governs the proliferation rate and number of ISCs and loss of PTEN results in an excess of ISCs. In PTEN mutants, excess ISCs initiate de-novo crypt formation and crypt fission, recapitulating crypt production in fetal/neonatal intestine.

The underlying mechanisms are still ill-defined. Here, we show for the first time that methylglyoxal (MG) and AGEs levels were elevated during mycobacterial infection of macrophages and that their increased levels mediated mycobacteria-induced apoptotic and immune response of macrophages. Moreover, we show that high levels of AGEs were formed at the sites of pulmonary tuberculosis. This observation represents the first evidence of the potential involvement of AGEs in tuberculosis and in infectious diseases in general. Global gene expression profiling of MG-treated macrophages reveals diversified potential roles of MG in cellular processes, including apoptosis, immune response, and growth regulation.

Methods and Results:  Transcriptional responses to both infection models were evaluated using microarrays.  After artificial infection with a variety of Aeromonas spp., mRNA extracts from the two models were processed and hydridized to murine microarrays to determine host gene response.  Definition of virulence was determined based on host mRNA production in murine neonatal intestinal tissue and mortality of infected animals.  Infections of mouse intestinal cell cultures were then performed to determine whether this simpler model system's mRNA responses correlated to neonatal results and therefore be predictive of virulence of Aeromonas spp.  Virulent aeromonads up-regulated transcripts in both models including multiple host defense gene products (chemokines, regulation of transcription and apoptosis, cell signaling).  Avirulent species exhibited little or no host response in neonates.  Mortality results correlated well with both bacterial dose and average fold change of up-regulated transcripts in the neonatal mice.   Conclusions:  Cell culture results were less discriminating but showed promise as potentially being able to be predictive of virulence.  Jun oncogene up-regulation in murine cell culture is potentially predictive of Aeromonas virulence. Significance and Impact of the Study: Having the ability to determine virulence of waterborne pathogens quickly would potentially assist public health officials to rapidly assess exposure risks.

How the three family members cooperate in tumor suppression remains unclear. Here, we report different but complementary functions of the individual members for regulating retinoblastoma protein (RB) function during myogenic differentiation. Whereas p53 transactivates the retinoblastoma gene, p63 and p73 induce the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57 to maintain RB in an active, hypophosphorylated state. DeltaNp73 inhibits these functions of the p53 family in differentiation control, prevents myogenic differentiation, and enables cooperating oncogenes to transform myoblasts to tumorigenicity. DeltaNp73 is frequently overexpressed in rhabdomyosarcoma and essential for tumor progression in vivo. These findings establish differentiation control as a key tumor suppressor activity of the p53 family.

If delivery is delayed after using AS, placental function and hence fetal growth may be compromised even further. We treated three pairs of pregnant C57/BL mice with AS and studied changes in placental gene expression by microarray analysis, these results were later confirmed by semi quantitative RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and Oligo ApopTaq assay. AS treated placentas were hydropic, friable and pale. Placental weight was decreased (78.8  16.7 mg compared to 81.3  17 mg, p<0.05) and so was fetal weight (914 38 mg compared to 1160 85 mg, p<0.05). There was more than 99% similarity between the three gene chip data sets. AS led to down-regulation of 1212 genes and up-regulation of 1382 genes. AS led to decrease in expression of genes involved in cell division like cyclin A2, B1, D2, CDK2, CDK4 and M phase protein kinase along with growth promoting genes like BMP4 and IGF-BP4. Tryptophan hydroxylase gene a key regulator of serotonin production was upegulated by >15 fold.

Short-term activation (2 weeks) of Akt1 resulted in completely reversible hypertrophy with maintained contractility. In contrast, chronic Akt1 activation (6 weeks) induced extensive cardiac hypertrophy, severe contractile dysfunction, and massive interstitial fibrosis. The focus of this study was to create a transcript expression profile of the heart as it undergoes reversible Akt1-mediated hypertrophy and during the transition from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure. Heart tissue was analyzed before transgene induction, 2 weeks after transgene induction, 2 weeks of transgene induction followed by 2 days of repression, 6 weeks after transgene induction and 6 weeks of transgene induction followed by 2 weeks of repression. Acute over expression of Akt1 (2 weeks) leads to changes in the expression of 826 transcripts relative to non-induced hearts, whereas chronic induction (6 weeks) led to changes in the expression of 1611, of which 65% represented transcripts that were regulated during the pathological phase of heart growth. Another set of genes identified were uniquely regulated during heart regression but not growth, indicating that non-overlapping transcription programs participate in the processes of cardiac hypertrophy and atrophy. These data define the gene regulatory programs downstream of Akt that control heart size and contribute to the transition from compensatory hypertrophy to heart failure. Keywords: transgenic mice, Akt1, time course, cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction, DNA microarrays Gene expression data from DTG-positive mouse hearts were examined before the induction of the transgene Akt1 (time point 1), 2 weeks after the induction of the transgene Akt1(time point 2), 2 weeks after the induction of the transgene Akt1 and 2 days after the repression of the transgene Akt1 (time point 3), 6 weeks after the induction of the transgene Akt1(time point 4) and 6 weeks after the induction of the transgene Akt1 and 2 weeks after the repression of the transgene Akt1 (time point 5).

A large body of evidence point to a role for Egr transcription factors in growth, survival, and differentiation. A major unanswered question is whether Egr transcription factors serve similar functions in diverse cell types by activating a common set of target genes. Signal transduction cascades in neurons and lymphocytes show striking parallels. Activation of either cell type activates the Ras-MAPK pathway and, in parallel, leads to increases in intracellular calcium stimulating the calcineurin-NFAT pathway. In both cell types, the strength of the activation signal affects the cellular outcomes and very strong stimuli lead to cell death.  Notably both these pathways converge on the induction of Egr genes. We believe that downstream targets of Egr transcription factors in lymphocytes may also be activated by Egr factors in activated neurons. There is precedence for common target gene activation in these two cell types: apoptosis in both activated T cells and methamphetamine stimulated neurons occurs via FasL induction by NFAT transcription factors.  We propose to use developing T lymphocytes (thymocytes) as a model system for discovery of Egr-dependent target genes for several reasons. First, we have observed a prominent survival defect in thymocytes from mice deficient in both Egr1 and Egr3 (1/3 DKO) and a partial differention block in the immature double negative (DN) stage. In addition, thymocytes are an easily manipulatable cell type, and the DN subpopulation affected in 1/3 DKO mice can be isolated to very high purity. We anticipate that 1/3 DKO thymocytes will provide an excellent experimental system that will provide insight into Egr-dependent transcription in neuronal development, activation, and death. To identify Egr transcription factor target genes in developing thymocytes. Egr1/3 DKO mice show a profound defect in thymocyte survival and differentiation, but the target genes downstream of Egr1 and Egr3 are unknown. Using Egr1/3 double knockout and wild type littermate mice, we will compare gene expression profiles from DN thymocytes  to identify genes that are deregulated in Egr1/3 DKO cells. Egr1 and Egr3 expression is necessary for the proper survival and differentiation of developing thymocytes.  We hypothesize that we will be able to identify crucial target genes of Egr1 and Egr3 by comparing gene expression profiles from wild type and 1/3 DKO thymocytes. Egr1 and Egr3 are first expressed in the immature double negative (DN) thymocytes. We will isolate DN thymocytes by FACS sorting which allows isolation of cell populations of >99% purity.  We will perform microarray analysis using the Mouse 430 2.0 gene array with thymocyte RNA samples from 3 wild type and 3 1/3 DKO mice (6 arrays total).  Differentially regulated genes (up-regulated and down-regulated) will be identified from the list of genes with significantly altered expression greater than or equal to 2-fold by paired T test.  Interesting genes will be validated by real-time PCR in wild type and 1/3 DKO thymocytes.  Recognizing that both direct and indirect target genes may be identified in the list of differentially expressed genes, real-time PCR validated target genes will be further screened using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with PCR (ChIP-PCR) to determine whether Egr1 and/or Egr3 are bound to potential regulatory regions of the putative target genes.

NRL, CRX and NR2E3 are key transcriptional regulators that control photoreceptor differentiation.  Mutations in NR2E3, a rod-specific orphan nuclear receptor, lead to loss of rods, increased density of S-cones, and supernormal S-cone-mediated vision in humans.  To better understand its in vivo function, NR2E3 was expressed ectopically in the Nrl-/- retina, where post-mitotic precursors fated to be rods develop into functional S-cones similar to the human NR2E3 disease.  Expression of NR2E3 in the Nrl-/- retina completely suppressed cone differentiation and resulted in morphologically rod-like photoreceptors, which were not functional.  Gene profiling of FACS-purified photoreceptors confirmed the role of NR2E3 as a strong suppressor of cone genes and an activator of a subset of rod genes (including rhodopsin) in vivo.  Ectopic expression of NR2E3 in cone precursors and differentiating S-cones of wild type retina also generates rod-like cells.  The dual regulatory function of NR2E3 is not dependent upon the presence of NRL and/or CRX, but on the timing and level of its expression.  Our studies reveal a critical role of NR2E3 in establishing functional specificity of post-mitotic photoreceptor precursors during retinal neurogenesis.   Keywords: genetic modification We mated the Crx::Nr2e3/Nrlko mice with the Nrl::GFP transgenic mice, in which the expression of GFP is driven by an Nrl promoter.

Restriction of T cell responses to a small number of selected epitopes (immunodominance) is a central feature of immune responses. Immunodominance is considered to be disadvantageous to the host because it allows pathogens to escape by selectively mutating the relevant epitope(s). Using Affymetrix microarrays, we compared the gene expression profile of unprimed CD8 T cells to that of effector CD8 T cells specific for a dominant (H7a) and a nondominant (HY) Ag. Our key finding is that T cells specific for the dominant and nondominant Ags displayed similar gene expression profiles except for a few gene transcripts, such as Gzma, Sell, Il7r and Klrg1, that contribute to the fitness of effector CD8 T cells. The differences between HY- and H7a-specific CD8 T cells were validated by real-time PCR and flow cytometry analyses. We propose that, by leading to selective expansion of the fittest CD8 effector T cells, immunodominance may be beneficial to the host. Inhibition of T cell response to nondominant Ags would ensure that host resources (APCs, cytokines) for which T cells compete are devoted to T cells that have the best effector potential. One implication is that, in general, favouring expansion of the fittest effector T cells may be more important that increasing the diversity of the T cell repertoire.

Consistent with this model is that inhibiting the RNAi pathway results in an increase in expression of repetitive elements in preimplantation mouse embryos.  Mouse oocytes are essentially transcriptionally quiescent providing a unique opportunity to assess the stability of repetitive element-derived transcripts in these cells.  We compared the transcriptome of freshly isolated fully-grown germinal vesicle (GV)-intact oocytes to that of oocytes in which meiotic maturation in vitro was inhibited for 48 h by milrinone.  Consistent with the aforementioned function for RNAi is that the abundance of only a relatively small number of transcripts decreased in the cultured oocytes, when compared to changes that occur during maturation or following fertilization, and of those, several belonged to mobile elements.

In EAE, therapeutic approaches targeting T cells have been successfully utilized leading to immunosuppression or tolerance. It has been recently shown that mesenchimal stem cells (MSC) isolated from C57BL/6J mice are an effective treatment of EAE induced by the encephalitogenic peptide pMOG 35-55. In this project we aim to track and evaluate the molecular changes the MSC acquire through several in-vitro passages that determine their therapeutic potential. Elucidation of the molecular pathways involved in this process will allow us to formulate better models of disease progression and curative strategies. Specific aim:The specific aim of this proposal is to dissect the molecular pathways that mesenchimal stem cells undergo during in-vitro treatment and confer them the therapeutic potential to cure EAE. To accomplish this aim, we will purify and grow murine MSC under the same conditions used for therapy as described in Zappia et al (In press. Brain, 2005) and obtain samples at several stages of the culture. RNA will be purified from each sample and profiled using Affymetrix microarrays. Initial bioinformatics analysis will include data transformation, normalization and filtering. A second stage analysis will involve time-series analysis by ANOVA and dynamic events modeling using neural networks. Stem cells are now viewed as potential source of cells for almost any tissue due to their postulated capacity to give rise to virtually any type of cell. Among them, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), can extensively proliferate in vitro and differentiate under appropriate conditions in bone, cartilage, and other mesenchymal tissues. It has been also reported that MSC can differentiate into other cells types including neuroectodermal cells. Furthermore, upon tissue injury MSC have been shown to migrate into the damaged brain. These results suggest that MSC could provide an ideal cell source for repair of injured organs including the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to their plasticity, MSC have been recently demonstrated to suppress several T lymphocyte activities thus exerting an immunoregulatory capacity both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms mediating such effect are only partially understood. We hypothesize that an analysis of how MSC acquire their therapeutic potential in vitro by expression profiling in a time series fashion will allow us to dissect the involved mechanisms. Before arriving to our lab in UCSF, samples will be processed as follows: Bone marrow from 6-8 weeks old C57BL/6J mice will be flushed out of tibias and femurs. After two washings by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min in PBS (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA), cells will be plated in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks at the concentration of 0.3-0.4 x 106 cells/cm2 utilizing Murine Mesencult as medium (Stem Cell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). Cells will be kept in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37  C for about 4-5 weeks, when only adherent cells will be collected following 10 min incubation at 37  C with 0.05% trypsin solution containing 0.02% EDTA. After the first cut and for the subsequent 4 or 5 passages, cells will be plated in 25 cm2 flasks at 1.2-2.0 x 104cells/cm2 . For the following passages cells will routinely seeded at 4-10 x 103cells/cm2 reaching confluence only after 4-5 days. Cells will be collected at selected timepoints and immersed in TRizol reagent and shipped to UCSF.  For the initial stage of this project cell will be collected at the following 5 time points: T0: Bone marrow aspirates (uncultured) T1: pre-mesenchymal stem cells (some cut before the population completely subtracted of Hematopoietic stem cells) T2: Mesenchymal  stem cells (in vitro assessed, functionally and phenotipically) T3: Mesenchymal stem cells biological active in vivo T4: Mesenchymal stem cells at the passage in vitro next to the one active in vivo T5: Mesenchymal stem cells no more active in vitro neither in vivo Once in our lab, RNA will be extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified by the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).

In the brain, loss of Dlx function results in defects in the production, migration and differentiation of GABAergic neurons, that can lead to epilepsy. In the branchial arches, loss of Dlx function leads to craniofacial malformations that include trigeminal axon pathfinding defects. To determine how these genes function, we wish to identify the transcriptional circuitry that lies downstream of these transcription factors by comparing gene expression in wild type with Dlx mutant CNS and craniofacial tissues. 1) Compare gene expression in the maxillay branch of the first branchial arch (BA) of E10.5 wild type and Dlx2 -/- mutants. 2) Compare gene expression in the maxillary branch of the first BA of E10.5 wild type and Dlx1/2 -/- mutants. 3) Compare gene expression in wild type maxillary and mandibular branchial arches. 4) Compare gene expressionin mandibular branch of Dlx5/6 -/- mutants with wild type mandibular branch. The Dlx transcription factors are essential for controlling patterning of the brain and craniofacial primordia. In the brain, they control differentiation of GABAergic neurons of the basal ganglia. In the branchial arches, they control regional patterning. I hypothesize that there will be some conserved and some divergent mechanisms that the Dlx genes use in controlling brain and craniofacial development. We have already performed array analyses on Dlx function in the developing basal ganglia (with TGEN) by comparing expressed genes in wild type and Dlx1/2 mutants. Here we will compare gene expression in the brachial arches of wild type and Dlx mutant mice. 1) Generate E10.5 mouse embryos that are either wild type, Dlx2-/-, Dlx1/2 -/- or Dlx5/6 -/-. 2) Determine genotype by PCR. 3) Dissect branchial arches from the different genotypes. 4) Separate maxillary and mandibular branch of each branchial arch. 5) Prepare total RNA from the specimens. Obtain sufficient tissue to obtain 10 ug of total RNA - based on previous experience we anticipate that this will require ~ 10 branchial arches.

Thousands of putative Myc target genes have been identified in in vitro studies, indicating that Myc exerts highly pleiotropic effects within cells and tissues. However, the complexity and diversity of Myc gene targets has confounded attempts at identifying which of these genes are the critical targets mediating Myc-driven tumorigenesis in vivo. Acute activation of Myc in a reversibly switchable transgenic model of Myc-mediated    cell tumorigenesis induces rapid tumor onset whereas subsequent Myc de-activation triggers equally rapid tumor regression. Thus, sustained Myc activity is required for tumor maintenance. We have used this reversibly switchable kinetic tumor model in combination with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to develop an unbiased strategy for identifying candidate Myc-regulated genes responsible for maintenance of Myc-dependent tumors. Consistent with known Myc functions, some Myc-regulated genes are involved in cell growth, cycle and proliferation. In addition, however, many Myc-regulated genes are specific to    cells, indicating that a significant component of Myc action is cell-type specific. Finally, we identify a very restricted cadre of genes whose expression is inversely regulated upon Myc activation-induced tumor progression and de-activation-induced tumor regression. By definition, such genes are candidates for tumor maintenance functions. Combining reversibly switchable, transgenic models of tumor formation and regression with genomic profiling offers a novel strategy with which to deconvolute the complexities of oncogenic signaling pathways in vivo Keywords: in vivo kinetic analyis myc function Transgenic mice expressing both the MycER and BclXL transgenes under the regulation of an insulin promoter were systemically injected with 4-hydroxytamoxifen to acutely activate MycER.

Cells coordinate the expression of voltage gated calcium channels with the expression of other proteins that regulate membrane potential and calcium homeostasis.  We report that the C-terminus of CaV 1.2, an L-type calcium channel (LTC) contains a C-terminal fragment that translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription.  This calcium channel associated transcription factor (CCAT) associates with transcriptional co-regulators such as p54nrb/NonO and binds to endogenous promoters.  CCAT regulates the expression of gap junctions, sodium calcium exchangers, NMDA receptors, potassium channels and other proteins that regulate neuronal signaling.  Electrical activity and developmental processes regulate the nuclear localization of CCAT, suggesting that the CCAT integrates information about the number of LTCs with information about the developmental history and electrical activity of a cell.  These findings provide the first evidence that voltage gated calcium channels can directly activate transcription and suggest a novel mechanism linking voltage gated channels to the function and differentiation of excitable cells. Keywords: Genetic modification Analysis The goal of these experiments was to identify the genes that are regulated by CCAT, a novel transcription factor derived from the C-terminus of CaV1.2.  Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells were transfected with the last 503 AA of CaV1.2 which is full length CCAT (CCAT FL) or with the last 280 AA of CaV1.2, a form of CCAT that lacks the transcriptional activation domain (CCAT DTA).  The mRNA from either CCAT FL or CCAT DTA expressing cells was hybridized to Agilent mouse genome microarrays along with mRNA from untransfected neuro2A cells (CCAT FL or DTA A series). Subsequent investigation revealed that transfection with the PA1 plasmid by itself increases the expression of some genes.  To control for this effect we compared Neuro2A cells transfected with full length CCAT (in PA1) with Neuro2A cells transfectected with PA1 alone (CCAT FL B series).

We are currently analyzing the protective effects on aSYN pathology by the molecular chaperone hsp70 in mice overexpressing wildtype human aSYN. Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing hsp70 have been cross-bred with the aSYN mouse line. Intriguingly, the aSYN / hsp70 double transgenics display a pronounced reduction in biochemically assessed aSYN aggregation. Gene expression of these mice will not only provide insight into the disease mechanisms of aSYN pathology but its prevention by the overexpression of hsp70, leading to new potential avenues of treatment.

To solve these questions, in this study, we performed transcriptome analyses of FO and MZ B cells sorted from spleens of normal unimmunized mice using gene chips. By comparison of gene expression profiles between FO and MZ B cells, we identified 1226 genes that are expressed higher in FO B cells than in MZ B cells.

To obtain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with the early onset of cardiac hypertrophy, we conducted a detailed comparative analysis of gene expression in 2.5-month-old control and FHC  alpha-TM175 and  alpha-TM180 ventricular tissue.  Results show that 754 genes (from a total of 22,600) were differentially expressed between the NTG and the FHC hearts.

This VP16-CREB-mediated L-LTP differs from the conventional late phase of LTP in not being dependent on new transcription. This finding suggests that in the transgenic mice the mRNA transcript(s) encoding the protein(s) necessary for this form of L-LTP might already be present in CA1 neurons in the basal condition. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify the mRNAs differentially expressed in the hippocampus of transgenic and wild-type mice. Keywords: Genetic modification, time course To identify the specific gene whose induction in hippocampal neurons correlated with the facilitated L-LTP phenotype, we harvested hippocampal mRNA at time points assessed in our physiological study and carried out a gene expression analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays. To obtain a sufficient quantity of poly(A)-RNA and reduce the effect of the biological variability of the sample, hippocampi from 6 to 10 mice matched for genotype and time of induction were pooled together in each sample. The final data set included genechips for animals on dox (gene Off) and for animals that were one, two, and five weeks after removal of dox (gene On). We also included samples from wild-type mice maintained under identical conditions and from transgenic mice that expressed VP16-CREB for three weeks before turning the transgene off again for two weeks with dox (Rev, gene Off). Since the isolation of mRNA from the whole hippocampus favors genes that are more broadly over-expressed in the hippocampus of transgenic mice and, therefore, may lead to an underestimation of the total complement of genes showing an altered expression in specific hippocampal subregions, we extended our comparison between transgenic and wild-type expression profiles using microdissected CA1 regions. We obtained two samples corresponding to VP16-CREB mice three weeks after induction and one sample corresponding to wild-type mice kept in the same conditions.

In order to elucidate molecular identities for these different  properties, we compared gene expression profiles of neurons located in nodose  ganglia (NG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in mice. Intraperitoneal administration of  Alexa Fluor-488 conjugated Cholera toxin B allowed identification of neurons  projecting to the viscera. Fluorescent neurons in DRG (from T10 to T13) and NG  were isolated using laser capture microdissection. Gene expression profiles of visceral  afferent neurons, obtained by microarray hybridization, were analysed using  multivariate spectral map analysis, SAM algorithm (Significance Analysis of  Microarray data) and fold-difference filtering. A total of 1996 genes were found to be  differentially expressed in DRG versus NG, including 41 G-protein coupled receptors  and 60 ion channels. Expression profiles obtained on laser-captured neurons were  contrasted to those obtained on whole ganglia demonstrating striking differences and  the need for microdissection when studying visceral sensory neurons because of  dilution of the signal by somatic sensory neurons. Furthermore, a detailed catalogue  of all adrenergic and cholinergic, GABA, glutamate, serotonin and dopamine  receptors, voltage-gated potassium, sodium and calcium channels and transient  receptor potential cation channels present in visceral afferents is provided. Our  genome-wide expression profiling data provide novel insight into molecular  signatures that underlie both functional differences and similarities between NG and  DRG visceral sensory neurons. Moreover, these findings will offer novel insight into  mode of action of pharmacologic agents modulating visceral sensation. Keywords: Cell type comparison Three separate experiments were performed.

In the present study, we explored the gene expression pattern of CD8+ DCs purified from the mouse spleen and treated with interferon (IFN)-gamma. The cytokine, indeed, potentiates the tolerogenic potential of this DC subset via induction of the immunosuppressive tryptophan catabolism mediated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). By comparing the expression of the IFN-gamma-modulated genes in IDO+ versus IDO- murine DCs, we found a consistent and selective association of the IDO-competent phenotype with the down-modulation of the Tyrobp gene, encoding the adapter molecule DAP12. IFN-gamma-mediated down-modulation of this gene involved IFN consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP), a transcription factor also known as IRF-8. While silencing of Tyrobp conferred IDO functional competence on IDO- DCs, silencing of Icsbp1 in IDO+ cells completely abolished IDO expression and function. In parallel, silencing of TYROBP conferred IDO competence on human IDO- DCs while silencing of IRF8 impaired IDO expression and activity in human IDO+ DCs. Therefore, the same small set of molecular switches controls IDO competence in murine and human DCs.

Using myogenic cell cultures, we asked whether hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces adaptive changes in skeletal muscle gene expression. H2O2 downregulated or failed to induce antioxidant or apoptotic genes in the myotubes. Instead, H2O2 changed the expression of genes for cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes, and upregulated inflammatory mediators. Finally, H2O2 had a mostly inhibitory effect on the expression of many transcription factors. The results indicate that mild oxidative stress may induce an adaptive response in skeletal muscle without antioxidant upregulation or apoptosis.

Microarrays were washed and stained with a streptavidin-bound marker and scanned. Data were analyzed with Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software. Only genes with consistent absent/present calls in all four independent replicates per group were considered for further analysis. Treatment comparisons were crossed so that each H2O2 sample was compared to each control. The software uses the one-sided Wilcoxon   s signed rank test to estimate    increase/no change/ decrease    difference calls for each pair-wise comparison. Only difference calls consistent in all pair-wise comparisons and with average changes > 1.75 were considered significant, resulting in a conservative list of genes with changed expression levels.

To identify genes that are differentially expressed in primary B cells lacking functional Btk, splenocytes from X-linked immunodeficiency (Xid), Btk knockout (KO) and immunocompetent CBA mice, were used in microarrays containing more than 12,000 genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). We found 4515 transcripts expressed in duplicate experiments in all three strains. Out of these, 38 were differentially expressed genes (21 up-regulated >2 fold and 17 down-regulated <-2 fold) between CBA and Btk defective mice. Ten out of these genes were selected and quantitative Real-Time PCR was conducted for validation and further investigation. Real-Time experiments correlated nicely with the microarray data.   No definitive phenotypic difference has previously been reported between Xid and Btk KO mice. We found 7 genes, whose expression differed (>2 fold) between the two strains. Moreover, when the 38 genes, which differed between immunocompetent CBA and Btk defective mice were ranked according to fold-increase, the levels in Btk KO mice were significantly more altered. This suggests that the defect in Btk KO mice is more severe and demonstrates that the mutant Btk protein in Xid mice does not generally function as dominant negative form.

Here we used microarray analysis of brown preadipocytes derived from wild-type and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) knockout (KO) animals, which exhibited progressively impaired differentiation, to define the set of genes that predict adipogenic potential in these cells.  374 genes/ESTs were identified whose expression in preadipocytes correlated with their ultimate ability to differentiate.  Many of these genes were related to early adipogenic events, including genes involved in extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal organization, growth arrest, post-mitotic clonal expansion, and inhibitors of adipogenesis, including preadipocyte factor-1 and multiple members of the Wnt-signalling pathway.  Reconstitution of IRS-1 KO cells with IRS-1 reversed these changes and restored the ability to differentiate.  Several of these genes showed concordant changes in brown adipose tissue in vivo.  Necdin was markedly increased in IRS-1 KO cells that could not differentiate, and knockdown of necdin restored brown adipogenesis with down-regulation of Pref-1 and Wnt10a expression.  We demonstrated a necdin-E2F4 interaction repressing PPARg transcription.  IRS proteins regulated necdin via a CREB dependent pathway, defining a signalling network involved in brown preadipocyte determination.

RNA expression data were generated in seven laboratories, comparing two standard RNA samples using twelve microarray platforms. At least two standard microarray types (one spotted, one commercial) were used by all laboratories.  Reproducibility for most platforms within any laboratory was typically good, but reproducibility between platforms and across laboratories was generally poor.  Reproducibility between laboratories dramatically increased when standardized protocols were implemented for RNA labeling, hybridization, microarray processing, data acquisition and data normalization.  Nonetheless, concordance could be found across different laboratories and platforms when data were analyzed in terms of enriched Gene Ontology categories.  These findings indicate that microarray results generated by multiple sites and platforms can be comparable, and that multi-investigator teams will maximize data comparability by adopting a common platform and a common set of procedures to generate compatible data.

Here we show that treatment of wild-type S49 lymphoma cells for 24 h with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (CPT-cAMP), a PKA-selective cAMP analog, alters the expression of ~4500 of ~13,600 unique genes. By contrast, gene expression was unaltered in Kin    S49 cells (that lack PKA) incubated with CPT-cAMP. Changes in mRNA and protein expression of several cell-cycle regulators accompanied cAMP-induced G1-phase cell-cycle arrest of wild-type S49 cells. Within 2 h, CPT-cAMP altered expression of 152 genes that contain evolutionarily conserved cAMP-response elements (CRE) within 5 kb of transcriptional start sites, including the circadian clock gene Per1. Thus, cAMP through its activation of PKA produces extensive transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic cells. These transcriptional networks include a primary group of CRE-containing genes and secondary networks that include the circadian clock.

We have developed a novel isolation method based on collagenase digestion and culture on a fetal liver-derived feeder layer and demonstrate that the feeder cells or their supernatants are required for endothelial progenitor survival and proliferation. Proteogenomic profiling of the endothelial progenitors and the feeder cells was done with tandem mass spectrometry proteomics using MudPIT and gene transcript expression profiling using high density DNA microarrays. This approach identified a number of gene transcripts, proteins and candidate growth factor pathways that are likely to be involved in endothelial progenitor growth, differentiation and angiogenesis.

Tourtellotte-5R01NS040748-03|Muscle spindles are skeletal muscle stretch receptors that mediate axial and limb position sensation (proprioception) to the central nervous system.  Defective proprioception, often characterized by gait ataxia and poor coordination, is present in a variety of human sensory and motor neuropathies having diverse etiologies. Spindles contain specialized intrafusal muscle fibers that are induced during development by sensory innervation.  The molecular events mediating the morphogenetic induction process are poorly characterized but depend upon neuregulins and their cognate ErbB receptor signaling.  Recently, we demonstrated that the transcription factor Egr3 is induced and regulated by intrafusal muscle fiber sensory innervation during spindle induction.  Moreover, Egr3-deficient mice have impaired spindle morphogenesis and profound gait ataxia.  Thus, Egr3 mediated transcription is critical for muscle stretch receptor development and potentially for myotube fate specification. Egr3 may mediate spindle morphogenesis induced by Neuregulin/ErbB signaling after myotubes are contacted by sensory axons during development.  As a starting point for understanding the specific role for Egr3 in this process, we will use a genome wide expression analysis to identify genes regulated (either directly or indirectly) by Egr3 in primary myotubes.  It is not practical to examine Egr3 mediated gene expression directly within spindles since they comprise less than 0.1% of the muscle mass.  Therefore, gene expression analysis will be examined in primary myotubes grown in vitro.  Primary myoblasts isolated from mice and differentiated in vitro are biochemically most similar to extrafusal muscle fibers which do not express Egr3.  To identify genes regulated by Egr3 in myotubes, gene expression in myotubes enforced to express full length Egr3 will be compared to gene expression in myotubes enforced to express truncated (transcriptionally inactive) Egr3. Egr3-deficient mice lack muscle spindles and have profound proprioceptive deficits.  Egr3 is specifically expressed in a subset of developing primary myotubes after innervation by sensory axons.  Spindle induction is dependent upon sensory/myotube contact which involves sensory axon produced neuregulin and ErbB receptor signaling in the myotube.  Shortly after or during induction, Egr3 expression is upregulated and maintained in the nascent myotube/spindle as one of the earliest molecular events know to occur during spindle morphogenesis.  We hypothesize that Egr3 mediated transcription is critical for engaging gene programs specific to and essential for, muscle spindle formation.  Moreover, Egr3 may be involved in fate specification of myotubes that develop into biochemically and physiologically distinct intrafusal muscle fibers within spindles.  To date, the target genes regulated by Egr3 during spindle morphogenesis have not been characterized. Myoblasts from wild type newborn mice will be isolated and purified.  Myoblasts will be plated on collagen coated plates and differentiated in vitro for 7 days.  During in vitro differentiation, myoblasts fuse to form multinucleated myotubes that exhibit contractile properties.  Egr3 is not expressed in myotubes in vitro, which is consistent with their similarity to extrafusal muscle fibers that also do not express Egr3 in vivo.  Only intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles express high levels of Egr3 in this muscle fiber context.  Adenoviruses that express full length Egr3 (Egr3wt; transcriptionally active) and truncated Egr3 (Egr3tr; transcriptionally inactive) have been generated and characterized in our laboratory.  After 7 days of in vitro differentiation, primary myotubes will be infected with either Egr3wt or Egr3tr adenoviruses.  100% infection is routinely obtained which is confirmed by coexpression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP).  Care will be taken to minimize viral induced toxicity of the myotubes after infection.  Myotubes are maintained after infection for 24 hours, after which total RNA is extracted from the cell lysates.  The two RNA samples will be used for microarray analysis to identify genes that are upregulated and downregulated by Egr3 in the myotube cellular context.  We will repeat the infection, RNA isolation and microarray analysis three times to minimize identifying false positive differentially expressed genes. Differentially expressed genes will be confirmed using real-time PCR.  Interesting differentially expressed genes will be examined by in situ hybridization to determine if they are specifically expressed in wild type spindles.  Since the identified differentially expressed genes will represent both indirect and direct target genes, we will perform Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from Egr3wt infected myotubes and screen the ChIP DNA library by PCR to determine which gene promoters are directly bound by Egr3.

We used RAKE to study human cell lines and brain tumors. We show that the RAKE assay is sensitive and specific for miRNAs and is ideally suited for rapid expression profiling of all known miRNAs. RAKE offers unique advantages for specificity over Northern blots or other microarray-based expression profiling platforms.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that miRNAs can be isolated and profiled from formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tissue, which opens up new opportunities for analyses of small RNAs from archival human tissue.

It is characterised by progressive movement, emotional and cognitive deficits. R6/2 transgenic mice carrying the Huntington   s disease mutation have a progressive neurological phenotype, including deterioration in cognitive function. The mechanism underlying the cognitive deficits in R6/2 mice is unknown, but dysregulated gene expression, reduced neurotransmitter levels and abnormal synaptic function are present before the cognitive decline becomes pronounced. Our goal here was to ameliorate the cognitive phenotype in R6/2 mice using a combination drug therapy (tacrine, moclobemide and creatine) aimed boosting neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Treatment from 5 weeks of age prevented deterioration in two different cognitive tasks until at least 12 weeks. However, motor deterioration continued unabated. Microarray analysis of global gene expression revealed that many genes significantly up- or down-regulated in untreated R6/2 mice had returned towards normal levels after treatment. Thus dysregulated gene expression was reversed by the combination treatment in the R6/2 mice and probably underlies the observed improvements in cognitive function. Our study shows that cognitive decline caused by a genetic mutation can be slowed by a combination drug treatment, and gives hope that cognitive symptoms in HD can be treated.

Stages correspond to Kit(+)/EpoR-high/CD71(+)/Ter119(-) proerythroblasts [stage I]; Kit-low/EpoR(+)/CD71-high/Ter119(+) polychromatophilic erythroblasts [stage II]; and Kit(-)/EpoR-low/CD71-low/Ter119-high/lowFALS normoblasts [stage III]. Primary splenic (pro)erythroblasts were prepared at 80, 100 and 120 hours post thiamphenicol dosing, and were purified by MACS using a transgenic erythroid-restricted    EE    tag. For each stage, duplicate hybridizations were performed. GSM3371 and GSM3372 are results from stage I hybridizations; GSM3373 and GSM3374 are results for stage II; and GSM3375 and GSM3376 are results for stage III. The order of listed genes is organized based first on average p-value among all six hybridizations in ascending order, and second on fold-increases in expression levels from stage I to stage II (descending order).   B] METHOD DETAILS (as a supplement to Zhang et al., submitted) B1-B6 below:   B.1/ ERYTHROID PROGENITOR CELL PREPARATIONS: Thiamphenicol (TAP) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was administered on day 1 to 8-week old Gata1-   EE    mice [1] (15 mg per gram weight in 0.4 mL of water) as a subcutaneous implant in Spectra Por 2 tubing (Spectrum, Houston, TX) [2]. On days 2 through 4, mice were phlebotomized (80mL blood per day), and TAP implants were removed on day 6. Splenocytes were prepared at 80, 100, or 120 hours post TAP withdrawal by disruption of spleens in Dulbecco   s Modified Eagle   s Medium (DMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1 U/mL Epo. Cells were passed through a 70 um strainer (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ), collected at 300 x g for 10 minutes, resuspended in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4), exposed for 2 minutes to 9 mL of 0.8% NH4Cl, 0.01 mM Na2EDTA buffered at pH 7.5 with KHCO3. Cells then were collected through 50% FBS in PBS, and washed in DMEM. B.2/ MACS: Splenocytes (3x10^8 cells per 3 spleens per preparation) in 3 mL of 5mM Na2EDTA, 0.5 % BSA in PBS, pH 7.2 (PBE) were incubated for 5 minutes at 15  C with murine IgG Fc fragment (5   g per mL) (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and pre-absorbed for 20 minutes at 15  C with anti-mouse IgG2a+2b magnetic microbeads (100   L per mL) (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Samples were passed through a magnetized MACS-LS column (non-specific adsorption) and unbound cells were collected, washed and resuspended (at 1 x 10^8 cells per mL) in 3 mL of PBE buffer. Cells then were incubated at 15  C for 15 minutes with monoclonal antibody EGFR.1 (5   g per mL) (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), washed in 20 mL of 2  C PBE buffer, resuspended in PBE at 1 x 10^8 cells per mL, and incubated for 20 minutes at 15  C with anti-mouse IgG2a+2b magnetic microbeads (200   L per mL). Bead-tagged (pro)erythroblasts were washed in 2  C PBE buffer, resuspended in 3 mL PBE, and applied to a MACS-LS column. Columns were washed six times with 3 mL of PBE, and EE-positive cells were recovered in 5 mL of PBE buffer. Overall, 6 x 10^6 stage I, II and III (pro)erythroblasts were purified from 12, 4, and 3 mice, respectively. B.3/ RNA ISOLATION AND ANALYSIS: Purified (pro)erythroblasts (6 x 10^6 cells) were lysed in 1 mL Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Chloroform (0.2 mL) was added and samples were vortexed and microcentrifuged at 7,500 rpm for 15 minutes at 4  C. The aqueous phase (approximately 0.5 mL) was recovered, and extracted using 0.5 mL of Trizol LS reagent plus 0.1 mL of chloroform. From the recovered epi-phase (750   L), RNA was precipitated using isopropanol (750   L), collected (10 minutes at 4  C, 12,000 rpm), washed with 80% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in 35   l of 70  C DEPC-treated water. In Northern blotting, RNA samples were electrophoresed in 6% formaldehyde 1.2% agarose gels, blotted to Nytran membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH), and fixed (312 nm radiation for 3 minutes; 2 hours at 80  C under vacuum). In hybridizations, Redivue deoxyadenosine 5'-(  -32P)-triphosphate labeled probes were prepared by random priming (Prime-a-Gene System, Promega, Madison, WI) using 25 ng of the following cDNA fragments: murine Epo receptor, 880 bp Bgl II to Xba I fragment of pUC19ER-DpI3K [3]; murine beta-major globin, 1,100 bp Bgl II to Xba I fragment of pGEM7-betamaj-globin [4]; murine Kit, 1,500 bp BamH I to Nhe I fragment of pRep4DEB-cKit [5]; murine Gata-1, Xho I fragment of pBluescript-GATA-1 [6]; 32P-labeled probes were isolated using Sephadex G-50 microcolumns (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Hybridizations were for 4 hours at 68  C using 2    10^6 cpm of probe per mL in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were exposed to X-OMAT AR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) and were assayed quantitatively by phosphor imaging (Storm 860 system, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). B.4/ BIOTIN-cRNA PREPARATION, AND ARRAY HYBRIDIZATIONS: First-strand cDNA was synthesized with a T7-oligo (dT) 24 primer (5'-GGC CAG TGA ATT GTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGG CGG-(dT) 24-3') (Geneset, La Jolla CA) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA) (1 hour, 42  C). DNA polymerase I (cat# 18010-017, Invitrogen) and RNase H (cat# 18021-041, Invitrogen) were used in second strand syntheses (2 hours, 16  C). Products were extracted in Tris-phenol: chloroform: isoamyl (25:24:1) using a phase-lock gel (cat# 175850, Eppendorf 5-prime, Boulder, CO). Precipitation was with 0.5 volumes of 7.5M NH4Ac, 5   g of glycogen and 2.5 volumes of -20  C absolute ethanol. Double stranded -cDNA (1   g in 10   l DEPC-treated water) was used per T7 RNA pol transcription (Enzo BioArray High Yield biotin-UTP and -CTP RNA Labeling Kit) (cat# 42655, Farmingdale, NY). Products were purified using QIAGEN RNeasy columns (cat# 72104) (Valencia, CA). For each sample (16   g total RNA) approximately 60   g of purified biotin-labeled cRNA was recovered. Labeled cRNA was fragmented for 35 min at 94  C in 500 mM potassium acetate (C2H3KO2), 150 mM magnesium acetate (C4H6MgO4), 200 mM Tris-acetate (C4H11NO3     CH3COOH), pH 8.1. Each sample (diluted 1:10 in hybridization buffer) was first hybridized to a Test2 Genechip to confirm full-length transcript representation. Replicate hybridizations were to Affymetrix murine U74Av2 arrays, and data were analyzed using Affymetrix Genechip 5.1 software. B.5/ ANALYSES OF PROFILING OUTCOMES: Transcripts expressed (detected) at each stage were identified based on a detection p-value of <0.05 in one replicate, and <0.1 in the other. 3'/5' ratios of housekeeping genes confirmed uniform biotin cRNA syntheses. Pair-wise comparisons among stages included 4659 transcripts detected in at least one stage, and employed averages of log expression values from duplicate hybridizations for each gene. In these comparisons, modulation is defined by vertical distances from a regression (no-modulation) trendline. For the above 4659 detected transcripts, mean expression values were normalized to account for chip/sample variability by subtracting the stage mean, and dividing by the stage standard deviation. The three normalized values of each gene (one for each stage) then were standardized by subtracting the gene mean and dividing by the gene standard deviation. Non-modulated genes (less than two-fold change) then were removed from further consideration. Clustering of the resulting data was performed by K-means (S+ package), a partitioning algorithm that pursues a minimum of the within-clusters sums of squares (WSS, which measures square Euclidean distances between cluster points and the cluster average within each cluster) [7]. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualize K-means clustering results. PCA is a common method for reduction of dimensionality.

Microarray methodology follows: cDNA for each sample was synthesized from 8.5   g total RNA using a Superscript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in combination with a T7-(dT)24 primer. Following phenol-chloroform extraction of the cDNA, biotinylated cRNA was transcribed in vitro using the BioArray HighYield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (ENZO Biochem, New York, NY) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Twenty micrograms of purified cRNA was fragmented by incubation in fragmentation buffer (200 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8.1, 500 mM potassium acetate, 150 mM magnesium acetate) at 94  C for 35 minutes and chilled on ice. Fifteen micrograms of fragmented biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized to the Murine Genome U74Av2 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), interrogating a total of 12,488 murine gene cDNA probes, for 16 hr at 45  C with constant rotation (60 rpm). The arrays were washed and then stained for 10 min at 25  C with 10   g/mL streptavidin-R phycoerythrin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) followed by 3   g/mL biotinylated goat anti-streptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories) for 10 minutes at 25  C. Arrays were then stained once again with streptavidin-R phycoerythrin for 10 min at 25  C. After washing and staining, the arrays were scanned using an Agilent GeneArray Scanner (Agilent Technologies) at 570 nm. Pixel intensities were measured, expression signals were analyzed and features extracted using a commercial software package (Microarray Suite ver 5.0, Affymetrix). Data mining and statistical analyses were performed with Data Mining Tool ver 3.0 (Affymetrix) algorithms. Arrays were globally scaled to a target intensity value of 2,500 in order to compare individual experiments. The absolute call (present, marginal, absent) of 12,488 gene expressions in each sample, as well as the direction of change, and fold change of gene expressions between samples were identified using the above-mentioned software.

RNA from the tibialis anterior of 4 animals were pooled and then split into two groups for hybridization onto two separate Affymetrix MGU74Av2 chips. Control samples were contralateral to the exercised legs, and were only subjected to enough contractions to measure isometric torque.   Eccentric contractions (ECs), in which a muscle is forced to lengthen while activated, result in muscle injury and, eventually, muscle strengthening and prevention of further injury. Although the mechanical basis of eccentric contraction-induced injury has been studied in detail, muscle's biological response is less well characterized. This study presents the development of a minimally-invasive model of EC injury in the mouse, follows the time course of torque recovery after an injurious bout of ECs, and uses Affymetrix microarrays to compare the gene expression profile 48 hours after ECs to both isometrically stimulated muscles and contralateral muscles. Torque dropped by about 55% immediately after the exercise bout, and recovered to initial levels 7 days later. 36 known genes were upregulated after ECs compared to contralateral and isometrically stimulated muscles, including five muscle specific genes: muscle LIM protein (MLP), Muscle Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (MARP 1 and 2; also known as cardiac ankyrin repeat protein and Arpp/Ankrd2, respectively), Xin, and Myosin Binding Protein H. The time courses of MLP and MARP expression after the injury bout (determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) indicate that these genes are rapidly induced, reaching a peak expression level of 6-11 times contralateral values 12-24 hours after the EC bout and returning to baseline within 72 hours. Very little gene induction was seen after either isometric activation or passive stretch, indicating that the MLP and MARP genes may play an important and specific role in the biological response of muscle to EC-induced injury.

Both types of challenges ultimately converge to activate common response systems represented in PVH, including the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathoadrenal system. Oligonucleotide microarrays (U74A; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were used to compare and contrast gene expression profiles in the PVH elicited at 1 and 3 hr after acute exposure to representative physiological [intraperitoneal injection of 10 microg lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] and emotional (30 min RST) stressors. In general, the two challenges recruited relatively few genes in common, with the degree of overlap varying across functional classes of genes. The greatest degree of commonality was seen among signaling molecules and neuropeptides, whereas transcription factors upregulated by RST and LPS were largely distinct. Unexpectedly, RST induced a number of immune-related molecules, which were not regulated by LPS. Hybridization histochemical analyses localized a subset of responsive transcripts to the PVH and/or immediately adjoining regions. Immunerelated molecules in particular distributed broadly to vascular and other barrier-associated cell types. These global transcriptional profiles inform the search for early (transcription factors) and late (target genes) mechanisms in the modulation of PVH, and generalized CNS, responses to categorically distinct stressors.

Subsequently, the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) was up-regulated in mouse cells of a Hes1- or RBP-J-null background. MLL-AF9-expressing Hes1-null AML cells showed enhanced proliferation and ERK phosphorylation following FLT3 ligand stimulation. FLT3 inhibition efficiently abrogated proliferation of MLL-AF9-induced Hes1-null AML cells. Furthermore, an agonistic anti-Notch2 antibody induced apoptosis of MLL-AF9-induced AML cells in a Hes1-wild type but not a Hes1-null background. These observations demonstrate that Hes1 mediates tumor suppressive roles of Notch signaling in AML development by down-regulating FLT3 expression. 4 samples are analyzed,  two pairs of MLL-AF9/Hes1-/- and MLL-AF9/Hes1+/+ leukemic bone marrows. ..

We therefore sought to compare gene expression profiles at the site of neural tube closure between stage-matched embryos from normal dams, and embryos from diabetic dams. Neurulation-stage mouse embryos at 8.5 days of gestation were used to prepare neural tissue at the anterior aspect of neural tube closure site 1. Tissue was procured from the open neural tube immediately anterior of the closure site, and from the closed neural tube immediately posterior to the closure site by laser microdissection. For each sample, 10 sections were pooled, total RNA was extracted, and 7 ng of total RNA were used for expression profiling by Tag sequencing using an Applied Biosystems SolidSAGE kit for library construction, and an AB SOLiD 5500 XL instrument for sequencing. Sequence reads were mapped to RefSeq RNA, and count data per gene were obtained using a modified version of the Applied Biosystems SOLiD    SAGE    Analysis Software. diabetic dam - closed neural tube // diabetic dam - open neural tube // normal dam - closed neural tube // normal dam - open neural tube .. diabetic;  normal;  total RNA;  closed;  open;  E8.5 embryo, neural tube at anterior boundary of closure 1;  FVB;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Cryosections of embryos at 8.5 days of gestation were used to prepare neural tube tissue by Laser microdissection.

We conducted a comparative study on metabolism-regulatory roles of VAAM, casein-simulating amino acid mixture (CAAM), and pure water on murine hepatic and adipose tissue transcriptomes. Mice were orally fed VAAM solution ( 0.675 g/ kg BW = 2% of food-derived amino acids = 0.38% of total food energy/ day), CAAM solution ( 0.675 g / kg BW/ day) or water under ad libitum for five days. Hepatic transcriptome comparison of VAAM, CAAM and water-treated groups revealed a VAAM-specific regulation of the metabolic pathway, i.e., the down-regulation of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, and up-regulation of poly unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and glycogenic amino acids utilization in TCA cycle. Similar transcriptomic analysis of white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT) suggested the up-regulation of phospholipid synthesis in WAT and the negative regulation of cellular processes in BAT. Because these coordinated regulations of tissue transcriptomes implicated the presence of upstream signaling common to these tissues, we conducted Ingenuity Pathways Analysis of these transcriptomes with the results that estrogenic and glucagon signals seemed to be activated in liver and WAT as well as beta-adrenergic signaling did in the three tissues by administration of VAAM. Our data provide a clue to understanding the role of VAAM in metabolic regulation of multiple tissues. Mice were divided randomly into three groups, VAAM, CAAM or water administered group. VAAM, CAAM or water was orally administrated five times once a day using feeding tube. The dosage of 1.8%VAAM, 1.8%CAAM or water was 37.5 microliter per gram of body weight. On day of last administration, food was removed and mice were moved to clean cages at 8:00. The last administrations started at 10:00. At 4 hours later after last administration, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation to collect blood, liver, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT).

This RNA seq experiment aimed to determine the molecular pathways affected by loss of Zfp36l1 and Zfp36l2, and to deduce direct targets of these RNA binding proteins. Methods: RNA was isolated from sorted Zfp36l1fl/fl; Zfp36l2fl/fl DN3a (Lineage-negative, CD44-, Kitlow, CD25+, CD98low) and DN3b (Lineage-negative, CD44-, Kitlow, CD25intermediate, CD98+) cells as well as Zfp36l1fl/fl; Zfp36l2fl/fl; CD2cre DN3 (Lineage-negative, CD44-, Kitlow, CD25+) cells with the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). RNAseq libraries were prepared from 20-200ng RNA using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA and rRNA Removal Mix     Gold from Illumina. Libraries were sequenced by Hiseq in 100bp single-end reads. The reads were trimmed to remove adapter sequences using Trim Galore then mapped using Tophat (version 2.0.12) to the GRCm38 mouse assembly; reads with an identical sequence to more than one genomic locus were not mapped.  Quality control analysis was carried out with FastQC.  Reads were counted using htseq-count tool and mouse gtf file version 78. Results:  Differences in the abundance of transcripts between DCKO and control samples were calculated in the R/Bioconductor program DESeq2 (version 1.6.3).  Adjusted P values for differential expression were calculated in DESeq2 using a Benjamini-Hochberg correction: genes with an adjusted p-value of less than 5% were considered significant. Differentially expressed mouse transcripts identified using DESeq2 were analyzed for gene set enrichment using Toppfun. Conclusions: We identified an enrichment of mRNAs involved in cell cycle progression within Zfp36l1 Zfp36l2 double conditional knockouts. 4 biological replicates of control DN3a, control DN3b and DCKO DN3-like cells were analyzed .. pre-T cell, lymphocyte;  Zfp36l1fl/fl, Zfp36l2fl/fl;  Zfp36l1fl/fl, Zfp36l2fl/fl, CD2cre;  total RNA;  thymus;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;

The following abstract from the submitted manuscript describes the major findings of this work.        Coupling of mitochondrial function and skeletal muscle fiber type by a miR-499/Fnip1/AMPK circuit. Jing Liu, Xijun Liang, Danxia Zhou, Ling Lai, Tingting Fu, Yan Kong, Qian Zhou, Rick B. Vega, Min-Sheng Zhu, Daniel P. Kelly, Xiang Gao, and Zhenji Gan.      Upon adaption of skeletal muscle to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli, muscle fiber type and mitochondrial function are coordinately regulated. Recent studies have identified pathways involved in control of contractile proteins of oxidative type fibers. However, the mechanism for coupling of mitochondrial function to muscle contractile machinery during fiber type transition remains unknown. Here, we show that the expression of the genes encoding type I myosins, Myh7/Myh7b and their intronic miR-208b/miR-499 parallels mitochondrial function during fiber type transitions. Using in vivo approaches in mice, we found that miR-499 drives a PGC-1a-dependent mitochondrial oxidative metabolism program to match shifts in slow-twitch muscle fiber composition. Mechanistically, miR-499 directly targets Fnip1, a known AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-interacting protein that negatively regulates AMPK, a known activator of PGC-1a. Inhibition of Fnip1 reactivated AMPK/PGC-1a signaling and mitochondrial function in myocytes. Restoration of the expression of miR-499 in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) reduced the severity of DMD. Thus, we have identified a miR-499/Fnip1/AMPK circuit that can serve as a mechanism to couple muscle fiber type and mitochondrial function.

Here we show that PDGF-BB induces pericyte fibroblast transition (designated as PFT), which significantly contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that the PDGF-BB-PDGFR   signaling promotes PFT in vitro and in in vivo tumors. Genome-wide expression analysis indicates that PDGF-BB-activated pericytes acquire mesenchymal progenitor features. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of PDGFR   ablate the PDGF-BB-induced PFT. Genetic tracing of pericytes with two independent mouse strains, i.e., TN-AP-CreERT2:R26R-tdTomato and NG2:R26R-tdTomato, shows that PFT cells gains stromal fibroblast and myofibroblast markers in tumors. Importantly, co-implantation of PFT cells with less-invasive tumor cells in mice markedly promotes tumor dissemination and invasion, leading to an increased number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastasis. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of vascular pericytes in PDGF-BB-promoted cancer invasion and metastasis by inducing PFT and thus targeting PFT may offer a new treatment option of cancer metastasis.

We have recently demonstrated that IVIg protects against airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) and inflammation in mouse models of allergic airway disease (AAD), associated with induction of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg). Using DEREG (DEpletion of REGulatory T cell) mice, in which endogenous Treg can be ablated with Diphtheria toxin (DTx) treatment, we demonstrate that IVIg generates a de novo population of induced Treg (iTreg) in the absence of endogenous Treg. IVIg-generated iTreg were sufficient for inhibition of ovalbumin-induced AHR in an antigen-driven murine model of AAD. In the absence of endogenous Treg, IVIg failed to confer protection against AHR and airway inflammation. Adoptive transfer of purified IVIg-generated iTreg prior to antigen challenge effectively prevented airway inflammation and AHR in an antigen-specific manner. The goal of this study was to characterize the gene expression profile of a pure population of IVIg-generated induced Treg (iTreg). Treg were isolated from mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). Animals were treated with IVIg to generate iTreg with or without DTx endogenous Treg pre-depletion.

To study the molecular processes underlying the association of plasma Fgf21 with NAFLD, we explored the liver transcriptome data of a mild NAFLD model of aging C57BL/6J mice at 12, 24, and 28 months of age. The plasma Fgf21 level significantly correlated with intrahepatic triglyceride content. At the molecular level, elevated plasma Fgf21 levels were associated with dysregulated metabolic and cancer-related pathways. The up-regulated Fgf21 levels in NAFLD were implied to be a protective response against the NAFLD-induced adverse effects, e.g. lipotoxicity, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress. An in vivo PPARalpha challenge demonstrated the dysregulation of PPARalpha signalling in the presence of NAFLD, which resulted in a stochastically increasing hepatic expression of Fgf21. Notably, elevated plasma Fgf21 was associated with declining expression of Klb, Fgf21   s crucial co-receptor, which suggests a resistance to Fgf21. Therefore, although liver fat accumulation is a benign stage of NAFLD, the elevated plasma Fgf21 likely indicated vulnerability to metabolic stressors that may contribute towards progression to end-stage NAFLD. In conclusion, plasma levels of Fgf21 reflect liver fat accumulation and dysregulation of metabolic pathways in the liver. Male C57Bl/6J mice were divided to 3 dietary intervention groups: Control (AIN-93W), 30% calorie restriction (CR; AIN-93W-CR) and medium fat (MF; AIN-93W-MF; 25% energy from fat).

Blood flow to the affected tissue must be restored quickly if viability and function are to be preserved. Collaterals are artery-to-artery or arteriole-to-arteriole interconnections that can bypass an occlusion by providing an alternative route for blood flow to the affected tissue. The increased flow and sheer stress initiate processes that result in the remodeling (arteriogenesis) of these vessels into efficient conductance arteries. Here we report that the mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) pathway activates cJun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) in endothelial cells. Disruption of Mlk2/3 or Jnk1/2 genes caused severe blockade of blood flow and failure to recover in the femoral artery ligation model of hindlimb ischemia because of abnormal collateral arteries. We show that the MLK-JNK pathway is essential for patterning and maturation of collateral arteries during development, but this pathway is not required for angiogenesis or arteriogenesis in adults. JNK in endothelial cells promotes Delta-like 4-induced Notch signaling and suppresses excessive sprouting angiogenesis during development. This function of the MLK-JNK pathway contributes to normal formation of native collateral arteries. The MLK-JNK pathway is therefore a key regulatory mechanism for vascular development. These data highlight the crucial importance of the collateral circulation in the response to arterial occlusive diseases.

However, the mechanism(s) that control their specification remain unclear. We performed transcriptional, molecular and in situ spatio-temporal analyses of macrophage development in mice. We report that Erythro-Myeloid Progenitors generate pre-macrophages (pMacs) that simultaneously colonize the head and caudal embryo from embryonic day (E)9.5 in a chemokine-receptor dependent manner, to further differentiate into tissue F4/80+ macrophages. The core macrophage transcriptional program initiated in pMacs, is rapidly diversified in early macrophages as expression of transcriptional regulators becomes tissue-specific. For example, the preferential expression of the transcriptional regulator Id3 initiated in early fetal liver macrophages appears critical for Kupffer cell differentiation, as inactivation of Id3 causes a selective Kupffer cell deficiency that persists in adults. We propose that colonization of developing tissues by differentiating macrophages is immediately followed by their specification as they establish residence, hereby generating the macrophage diversity observed in post-natal tissues.

Therefore, it is critical to elucidate the biological mechanisms that underlie tumor progression and metastasis.  Using signaling pathway signatures we previously predicted a role for E2F transcription factors in Myc induced tumors.  To test this role we interbred MMTV-Myc transgenic mice with E2F knockouts.  Surprisingly, we observed that the loss of E2F2 sharply increased the percentage of lung metastasis in MMTV-Myc transgenic mice. Examining the gene expression profile from these tumors, we identified genetic components that were potentially involved in mediating metastasis.  These genes were filtered to uncover the genes involved in metastasis that also impacted distant metastasis free survival in human breast cancer.  In order to elucidate the mechanism by which E2F2 loss enhanced metastasis we generated knockdowns of E2F2 in MDA-MB-231 cells and observed increased migration in vitro and increased lung colonization in vivo.  We then examined genes that were differentially regulated between tumors from MMTV-Myc, MMTV-Myc E2F2-/-, and lung metastases samples and identified PTPRD. To test the role of PTPRD in E2F2-mediated breast cancer metastasis, we generated a knockdown of PTPRD in MDA-MB-231 cells. We noted that decreased levels of PTPRD resulted in decreased migration in vitro and decreased lung colonization in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that E2F2 loss results in increased metastasis in breast cancer, potentially functioning through a PTPRD dependent mechanism.

In addition to exhibiting social deficit and hyperphagia-like behavior, the sCSDS mice keep much more water in their body than control mice. In order to investigate the effect of social defeat stress on not only central nervous system but also function of gastrointestinal tract, the gene expression in ileum of stressed mice was compared with control mice. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression after 10 days of social defeat stress and identified distinct classes of down-regulated genes during this process.

A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate CD8 T cell responses during chronic infection is required to improve immunotherapies that restore function in exhausted CD8 T cells. Here we identify a novel population of virus-specific CD8 T cells with a T follicular helper (Tfh)-like signature in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). These Tfh-like CD8 T cells expressed the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitory receptor but at the same time also expressed co-stimulatory molecules and had a gene signature that was related to CD8 T cell memory precursor cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). These Tfh-like CD8 T cells acted as stem cells during chronic infection undergoing self-renewal and also differentiating into the terminally exhausted CD8 T cells that were present in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. The Tfh-like CD8 T cells were found only in lymphoid tissues and resided predominantly in the T cell zones along with na  ve CD8 T cells. Interestingly, the proliferative burst after PD-1 blockade came almost exclusively from this Tfh-like CD8 T cell subset. Importantly, the transcription factor TCF1 played a cell intrinsic and essential role in the generation of Tfh-like CD8 T cells. Taken together, our study identifies Tfh-like CD8 T cells as the critical subset for maintaining the pool of virus-specific CD8 T cells during chronic infection and as the cells that proliferate after PD-1 blockade. These findings provide a better understanding of T cell exhaustion and have implications towards optimizing PD-1 directed immunotherapy. 8 samples isolated from CD8 T-cells in LCMV clone 13 GK1.5 infected mice (2 na  ve, 3 CXCR5+Tim3-, 3 CXCR5-Tim3+) cells were analyzed ..

The resulting protein does not bind to ligands and is constitutively activated. The expression of EGFRvIII is likely confined to various types of cancer, particularly glioblastomas. Although an anti-EGFRvIII vaccine is of great interest, low-molecular-weight substances are needed to obtain better therapeutic efficacy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify low molecular weight substances that can suppress EGFRvIII-dependent transformation. Methods: We constructed a new throughput screening system and searched for substances that decreased cell survival of NIH3T3/EGFRvIII spheres under 3-dimensional (3D)-culture conditions, but retained normal NIH3T3 cell growth under 2D-culture conditions. In vivo activity was examined using a mouse transplantation model, and derivatives were chemically synthesized. Functional characterization of the candidate molecules was investigated using an EGFR kinase assay, immunoprecipitation, western blotting, microarray analysis,quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, and measurement of lactate and ATP synthesis. Results: In the course of screening 30,000 substances, a reagent,    Ertredin,    was found to inhibit anchorage-independent 3D growth of sphere-forming cells transfected with EGFRvIII cDNA. Ertredin also inhibited sphere formation in cells expressing wild-type EGFR in the presence of EGF. However, it did not affect anchorage-dependent 2D growth of parental NIH3T3 cells. The 3D-growth-inhibitory activity of some derivatives, including those with new structures, was similar to Ertredin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ertredin suppressed tumor growth in an allograft transplantation mouse model injected with EGFRvIII- or wild-type EGFR-expressing cells; a clear toxicity to host animals was not observed. Functional characterization of Ertredin in cells expressing EGFRvIII indicated that it stimulated EGFRvIII ubiquitination, suppressed both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis under 3D conditions, and promoted cell apoptosis. Conclusion: We developed a high throughput screening method based on anchorage-independent sphere formation induced by EGFRvIII-dependent transformation. In the course of screening, we identified Ertredin, which inhibited anchorage-independent 3D growth and tumor formation in nude mice. Functional analysis suggests that Ertredin suppresses both mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cytosolic glycolysis in addition to promoting EGFRvIII degradation, and stimulates apoptosis in sphere-forming, EGFRvIII-overexpressing cells. Patterns of gene expression in cells treated with Ertredin (sample 2), rotenone (sample 3), and AG1478 (sample 4) were compared with vehicle-control cells (sample 1). ..

This kind of drug consumption during adolescence is a matter of concern. We studied, in adolescent CD-1 mice, whether low-moderate doses of EtOH could enhance the psychostimulant (locomotor acivity) and reinforcing (conditioned place preference, CPP) effects of mephedrone. Simultaneously we also determined the most relevant transcriptional changes associated to a reinforcing treatment. A single dose of Meph (10 mg/kg, sc) induced an increase of about 100% in locomotor activity, which was a further enhanced by 40% when associated with a dose of EtOH (1 g/kg). The hyperlocomotion was partially antagonized by ketanserin and haloperidol, but only haloperidol blocked the potentiation induced by EtOH.  Furthermore, Meph (25 mg/kg) induced significant positive conditioning, which increased by 70% when administered with 0.75 mg/kg EtOH. Microarray analysis of mRNA extracted from anterior striata of the mice used in CPP experiments reported significant modifications in genes related with neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, which were further validated by Real-time PCR for all three drug-treated groups. Four groups were compared in the study: adolescent Swiss CD-1 mice treated with saline, ethanol, mephedrone or mephedrone + ethanol during the conditioned place preference (CPP) ten-day procedure, aimed at evaluating reward.

METHODS   Differential gene expression of over 34,000 well-characterized mouse genes, in the RPE/choroid of 6 week old C57BL/6J mice were analyzed after intravitreal steroid injections at 1 week and 1 month post injection, using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays.  The data were analyzed using GeneSpringGX12.5 and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) microarray analysis software for biologically relevant changes.    RESULTS   Both triamcinolone and dexamethasone caused differential activation of genes involved in    Circadian Rhythm Signaling    pathway at both time points tested.  Triamcinolone (TAA) uniquely induced significant changes in gene expression in    Calcium Signaling    (1 week) and    Glutamate Signaling    pathways (1month).  In contrast, Dexamethasone (Dex) affected the    GABA Receptor Signaling    (1 week) and    Serotonin Receptor Signaling    (1month) pathways.    CONCLUSIONS  Understanding how intraocular steroids affect the gene expression of RPE/choroid is clinically relevant.  This in vivo study has elucidated several genes and pathways that are potentially altering the circadian rhythms and several other neurotransmitter pathways in RPE/choroid cells during intravitreal steroid injections, which likely has consequences in the dysregulation of RPE function and neurodegeneration of the retina.

Mouse models of SCLC based on inactivation of Rb1 and Trp53 developed earlier showed frequent amplifications of two transcription factor genes: Nfib and Mycl. Overexpression of Nfib but not Mycl in SCLC mouse results in an enhanced and altered metastatic profile, and appears to be associated with genomic instability. NFIB promotes tumor heterogeneity with the concomitant expansive growth of poorly differentiated, highly proliferative, and invasive tumor cell populations. Consistent with the mouse data, NFIB expression in high-grade human neuroendocrine carcinomas correlates with advanced stage III/IV disease warranting its further assessment as a potentially valuable progression marker in a clinical setting.

Further studies have proposed that developmentally distinct tissue MF can be identified based on the differential expression of F4/80 and CD11b, but whether a characteristic transcriptional profile exists is largely unknown. Here, we established an inducible fate mapping system that facilitated the identification of A2 progenitors of the YS as source of F4/80hi but not CD11bhi MF. Large-scale transcriptional profiling of MF precursors from the YS until adulthood allowed the description of a complex MF pedigree. We further identified a distinct molecular signature of F4/80hi and CD11bhi MF and found that Irf8 was vital for MF maturation and the innate immune response. Our data provide new cellular and molecular insights into the origin and developmental pathways of tissue MF. All samples are from mouse tissue at early developmental stages (E8, E9.5, E14) and from adulthood (6 weeks old). For the early developmental time points timed matings were performed.

Further, given the heterogeneity of treatment response in human populations, examining both treatment response and non-response is critical. Methods: We compared the effects of a conventional monoamine-based tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine (14 daily injections), and a rapidly acting, experimental, non-monoamine-based antidepressant, ketamine (single injection), in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress, a validated model of depression, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze transcriptional profiles associated with susceptibility, resilience and antidepressant response and non-response in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. Results: We identified approximately equal numbers of responder and non-responder mice following ketamine or imipramine treatment. Ketamine induced more expression changes in hippocampus than other brain regions; imipramine induced more expression changes in nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Transcriptional profiles in ketamine and imipramine responders were most similar in PFC, where the least transcriptional regulation occurred for each drug. Non-response reflected both the lack of response-associated gene expression changes and unique gene regulation. In responders, both drugs reversed susceptible associated transcriptional changes as well as induced resilient associated transcription in PFC, with effects varying by drug and brain region studied. Conclusions: We generated a uniquely large resource of gene expression data in four inter-connected limbic brain regions implicated in depression and its treatment with imipramine or ketamine. Our analyses highlight the PFC as a key site of common transcriptional regulation by both antidepressant drugs and in both reversing susceptibility and inducing resilience associated molecular adaptations. In addition, we found region-specific effects of each drug suggesting both common and unique effects of imipramine versus ketamine. mRNA profiles of susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress as well as treatment response were generated across 4 separate brain regions, with a sample size of 3-5 per group. ..

However, the spatiotemporal mechanisms by which PRC2 achieves diverse epigenomes for specific tissue or cellular contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we discovered that LATS2 knockout causes dysregulation of PRC2 and subsequent transcriptome changes for differentiation in both mouse and human cells. LATS2 depletion dependent dysregulation of PRC2 also effects H3K4me3 and forms negative feedback loop for maintenance of PRC2. Further analyses reveal that LATS2 on chromatin binds to EZH2 and LATS2 has ability to phosphorylate PRC2 in vitro. These LATS2 dependent H3K27me3 targets are highly induced during neurogenesis, and statistical analysis of glioblastoma multiforme reveals that LATS2-high cases show more dedifferentiated transcriptome and poor prognosis with silencing of H3K27me3 targets. These observations suggest that LATS2-mediated epigenome coordination is pivotal for development and disease, including cancer.

Existing induction methods, however, mostly rely on the effects of growth factors, which generally tend to result in  mixed populations of neurons. Here we report that over-expression of specific transcription factors (TFs) in ESCs can rather guide the differentiation of ESCs towards specific neuron types. Analysis of published data on gene expression changes early (two days) after induction of each of 185 induced TFs implicated candidate TFs for further ESC differentiation studies. After induction for 6 days four of them (Ascl1, Smad7, Nr2f1, and Ascl2) generated a high proportion (>35%) of cells with neural progenitor marker PSA-NCAM and clear neural morphology on day 14. The capacity of these TFs to induce neural differentiation is inferred to be most likely linked to early activation of the Notch signaling pathway. Among the neuron-like cells, GABA-positive cells were most abundant (32-97% for 4 top TFs), whereas Isl1-positive cells and TH-positive cells were less abundant (<12% and <5%, respectively). Enrichment of cells obtained with the induction of Ascl1, Smad7, and Nr2f1 using beads with anti-PSA-NCAM antibody resulted in essentially pure population of neuron-like cells with expression profiles similar to neural tissues and highly expressed markers of GABAergic neurons. A time-course experiment with induction of Ascl1 showed early upregulation of most neural-specific and GABAergic-specific mRNA and miRNAs. We identified mRNA and miRNAs, whose expression depended on the induction of Ascl1, and showed that they were enriched in Ascl1 target genes. In summary, this study indicates that induction of transcription factors is a promising approach to generate candidate specific neural cell types from ESCs. Transcription factor Ascl1 was induced in mouse ESCs to facilitate neural differentiation. Expression of transgenic Ascl1 was repressed by doxycycline (Dox); thus, it were induced in Dox- conditions, whereas Dox+ conditions represent control cells with no expression of Ascl1 transgene. For neural differentiation, cells were cultured 3 days in alpha-MEM medium and then - in NeuroCult neural differentiation medium for 2-11 days (total up to 14 days).

It has been largely documented that IBD frequently lead to colorectal cancers (CRC). The identification of causative factors of IBD is thus essential to understand CRC progression and develop therapeutical approaches. Models have been described in which molecular alterations are combined with inflammatory treatments in order to recapitulate IBD-associated CRC. Here, we describe a mouse line,   6fl/fl Villin-Cre, in which inactivation of the gene encoding the integrin alpha-6 subunit (ITGA6) specifically in the intestinal mucosa results into chronic inflammation and intestinal carcinogenesis. In these mice, the loss of integrin alpha-6 beta-4, a receptor mediating the attachment of epithelial cells to laminins, leads to epithelial detachment, hyperplasia, chronic inflammation, rectal prolapses, and ultimately adenocarcinomas. Alterations of differentiation affecting mucus secreting (goblet) cells as well as changes in expression of essential intestinal transcription factors were detected. Thus alpha-6 beta-4 integrin is a key factor for the maintenance of intestinal integrity and its loss may represent a risk factor for tumor progression associated with IBD. Transcriptome analysis of RNA from normal versus inflamed and carcinomatous rectal mucosa of   6 integrin deficient intestinal epithelium mice was performed. RNAs were prepared from 5 adenocarcinomas, which were macrodissected from the rectal prolapses and 4 flanking inflamed rectal mucosa of 53-80 week-old   6fl/fl Villin-Cre mice.

We integrate CLIP-seq and RNA Bind-N-Seq technologies to discover that TAF15 binds to ~4,900 RNAs enriched for GGUA motifs. In the mouse brain, TAF15 and FUS, but not TDP-43, exhibit strikingly similar RNA binding profiles, yet they alter the expression of distinct mRNA populations upon their individual depletions. TAF15 has a minimal role in alternative splicing and instead affects RNA turnover, consistent with an enrichment of TAF15 binding sites in 3    untranslated regions. In human stem cell-derived motor neurons, loss of both TAF15 and FUS affected mRNAs distinct from those altered by loss of either protein alone, revealing redundant roles for TAF15 and FUS in maintaining mRNA levels. Furthermore, concomitant rather than individual depletion of TAF15 and FUS more closely resembles RNA profiles of motor neurons derived from FUS R521G ALS patients or from late-stage, sporadic ALS patients. Our study reveals convergent and divergent mechanisms by which FUS, TAF15 and TDP-43 affects RNA metabolism in neurological disease.

FXS is due to the absence of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein mainly involved in translational control. Even if this molecular defect is known, no specific therapy is available for FXS. The first alteration observed in the brain of FXS patients and of Fmr1 KO mice, model for FXS, is represented by an abnormal dendritic morphology that is associated with an altered synaptic plasticity. These findings led to numerous studies focused on mature neurons. However, recently, an increasing body of evidence is pointing out the importance of FMRP in the early steps of brain development. Thus, with the purpose to decipher the earliest molecular events leading to FXS we developed a stem-cell-based disease model by knocking-down the expression of Fmr1 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. To gain insights in the pathways that are affected when FMRP is repressed, we performed a gene expression profile analysis comparing total RNA from shFmr1 and shControl ES cells using whole genome mouse microarrays. Transcripts were clustered according to their Gene Ontology classification using the DAVID software. Surprisingly, the most altered functional category was Nervous system development and function, highlighting the role of FMRP also during the earliest steps of neural development. To study the precise role of FMRP in Embryonic stem (ES) cells, we used an RNAi-based loss-of-function strategy by transducing mouse ES cells with a lentivirus expressing GFP and a shRNA targeting the constitutive exon 1 of Fmr1 (shFmr1).

Greater understanding of the mechanisms of action of these cytokines could allow new therapeutic approaches.  We found that type 1 IFNs induced changes in cellular metabolism that were critical for changes in target cell function. This was apparent in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are specialized for type 1 IFN production, where toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9)-dependent activation was found to be dependent on increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) induced by autocrine signaling through the type 1 IFN receptor (IFNAR). Type 1 IFNs also induced FAO/OXPHOS in non-hematopoietic cells and were found to be responsible for increased FAO/OXPHOS in virus-infected cells.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of   -cells from 3 and 26 month old mice to explore how changes in gene expression contribute to improved function with age. The old mice were healthy, had reduced blood glucose levels and increased   -cell mass, which correlated to their body weight.   -cells from young and old mice had similar transcriptome profiles. In fact, only 193 genes (0.89% of all detected genes) were significantly regulated (    2-fold; false discovery rate < 0.01; normalized counts > 5). Of these, 183 were downregulated and mainly associated with pathways regulating gene expression, cell cycle, cell death and survival as well as cellular movement, function and maintenance. Collectively, our data show that   -cells from very old mice have transcriptome profiles similar to those of young mice. These data support previous findings that aging is not associated with reduced   -cell mass or functional   -cell decline in mice.

ILC2s do not directly recognize allergens but they are stimulated by cytokines including interleukin (IL)-33 released by damaged epithelium.Lung ILC2s, upon stimulation, produce T helper 2 cell-type cytokines inducing T cell independent allergic lung inflammation. We now report that lung ILC2s, upon activation by an allergen or IL-33, acquire the properties of memory cells. The activated ILC2s initially proliferate and secrete cytokines, followed by a contraction phase as they stop producing cytokines. Nevertheless, some persist long after the resolution of the inflammation and acquire intrinsic capacities to react to unrelated allergens more vigorously than na  ve ILC2s, thus mediating a severe allergic lung inflammation. Gene expression profiles of the previously activated ILC2s show a gene signature of memory T cells. These antigen non-specific memory ILC2s may explain why asthma patients are often sensitized to multiple allergens. ILC2s were isolated from mouse lungs from naive and IL-33 injected mice 4 days, 14 days and 4 months after the initial treatment. RNA was extracted from those ILC2 populations and analyzed for gene expression profiles.

Using a murine chronic virus that models human infections, we investigated the function of the adhesion molecule, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) that is upregulated on responding T cells. PSGL-1-deficient mice unexpectedly cleared the virus due to dramatic increases in the intrinsic survival of multifunctional effector T cells that had downregulated PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors. Notably, this response resulted in CD4+ T cell-dependent immunopathology. Mechanistically, PSGL-1 ligation on exhausted CD8+ T cells inhibited TCR and IL-2 signaling, and upregulated PD-1, leading to diminished survival with TCR stimulation. In models of malignant melanoma where T cell dysfunction occurs, PSGL-1-deficiency led to PD-1 downregulation, improved T cell responses, and tumor control. Thus, PSGL-1 plays a fundamental role in balancing viral control and immunopathology, and also functions as a checkpoint that regulates T cell responses in the tumor microenvironment. WT or PSGL-1 KO mice were infected with 2 x 10^6 PFU LCMV Clone 13. Spleens from 10 WT or 10 PSGL-1 KO animals were pooled and processed.

Using an AML mouse model driven by tet-regulated MLL-AF9 co-expressed with oncogenic NRASG12D (Tet-off MLL-AF9), we demonstrated that MLL-AF9 regulates the E protein pathway by suppressing Id2, while activating the expression of its target E2-2. Moreover, we found that Id2 over-expression in Tet-Off MLL-AF9 AML cells in vitro partially phenocopies MLL-AF9 depletion and results inhibition of leukemia growth, loss of leukemia stem cell-associated gene expression pattern and induction of differentiation. To compare gene expression changes associated with enforced Id2 expression and MLL-AF9 withdrawal, RNA sequencing analysis was performed on Tet-off MLL-AF9 cells transduced with an Id2 over-expressing or a control vector, or upon MLL-AF9 dox-inducible knock-down. Primary AMLs driven by Tet-off inducible MLL/AF9 expression linked to dsRED reporter, in association with oncogenic NRASG12D (Tet-off MLL-AF9) were generated by reconstituting lethally irradiated congenic mice with foetal liver cells co-transduced with a Tet-Off-MLL-AF9-dRED retroviral vector and a second vector co-expressing NRASG12D together with the Tet-Off responsive transcriptional activator.

To clarify lineage commitment mechanisms, we followed developing T cells at the single-cell level using Bcl11b knock-in fluorescent reporter mice. Notch signaling and Notch activated transcription factors collaborate to activate Bcl11b expression irrespectively of Notch-dependent proliferation. These inputs work via three distinct, asynchronous mechanisms: an early locus    poising    function dependent on TCF-1 and GATA-3, a stochastic-permissivity function dependent on Notch signaling, and a separate amplitude-control function dependent on Runx1, a factor already present in multipotent progenitors.

MLL-AF9 expression in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) in vitro resulted in unprecedented clonogenic growth and expression of genes involved in migration and invasion. In vivo, some LT-HSC-derived AMLs were particularly aggressive with extensive tissue infiltration, chemo-resistance and expression of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in solid cancers. Knockdown of the EMT regulators Zeb1 and Tcf4 significantly reduced leukemic blast invasion. By classifying mouse and human leukemia according to Evi1/EVI1and Erg/ERG expression, reflecting aggressiveness and cell-of-origin and performing comparative transcriptomics we identified numerous EMT-related genes that were significantly associated with poor overall survival of AML patients.

After grouping the cells into cell types (based on the single-cell transcriptomes), we identified actual physical interactions that occurred more, or less, than what would be expected by chance. We compared the micro-dissected data to sorted hematopoietic stem cells. After mild dissociation of the bone marrow, we micro-dissected many small interacting structures (cell doublets, triplets etc.) into single cells, and sequenced their mRNAs.

Furthermore, DNMT3A-R882H induced DNA hypomethylation facilitates gene enhancer/promoter activation and recruitment of Dot1l-associated transcription elongation machineries.

We developed a method, MARIO (MApping Rna-rna Interactions in vivO), to map protein-assisted RNA-RNA interactions in vivo. By circumventing the selection for a specific RNA-binding protein 2-5, our approach vastly expands the identifiable portion of the RNA interactome. Using this technology, we mapped the RNA interactome in mouse embryonic stem cells, which was composed of 46,780 RNA-RNA interactions. The RNA interactome was a scale-free network, with several lincRNAs and mRNAs emerging as hubs. We validated an interaction between two hubs, Malat1 and Slc2a3 using single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. Base pairing was observed at the interaction sites of long RNAs, and was particularly strong in transposonRNA-mRNA and lincRNA-mRNA interactions. This reveals a new type of regulatory sequences acting in trans. Consistent with their hypothesized roles, the RNA interaction sites were more evolutionarily conserved than other regions of the transcripts. MARIO also provided new information on RNA structures, by simultaneously revealing the footprint of single stranded regions and the spatially proximal sites of each RNA. The unbiased mapping of the protein-assisted RNA interactome with minimum perturbation of cell physiology will greatly expand our capacity to investigate RNA functions.

However, factors that induce differentiation of mucosal mast cells in the intestinal mucosa are largely unknown. To identify factors involved in mucosal mast cell differentiation, we compared the gene expression profiles between mucosal mast cells isolated from the small intestine and bone marrow-derived mast cells cultured in the presence of TGF-   or Notch ligand. Mucosal mast cells were isolated from the small intestine of na  ve BALB/c mice by flow cytometry. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) were generated by culturing BALB/c bone marrow cells with murine interleukin-3 and stem cell factor for 3-4 weeks, and then cells were cultured for 6 days in the presence or absence of TGF-   or Delta-like 1 (Dll1), which is a Notch ligand. Total RNAs extracted from these cells were processed and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips. .. bone marrow derived mast cell;  intestinal mast cell;  total RNA;  cocultured with mouse Notch ligand Dll1-expressing CHO cells for 6 days;  cultured in normal medium for 6 days;  cultured with TGF-?1 (5 ng/ml) for 6 days;  isolated from the small intestine lamina propria of na?ve BALB/c mice by flow cytometry;  Bone marrow derived mast cells cultured in normal medium for 6 days;  Bone marrow derived mast cells cultured in the presence of Notch ligand Dll1 for 6 days;  Bone marrow derived mast cells cultured in the presence of TGF-? for 6 days;  Mucosal mast cells isolated from the small intestine of na?ve mice;  BALB/c;  10090;  Mus musculus;

In this study, we investigated metabolic mechanisms underlying the differentiation of IL-9 producing-CD4+T cells (TH9) in allergic airway inflammation and cancerous tumors. We found here that SIRT1 negatively regulates TH9 differentiation. A deficiency of SIRT1 induced by either conditional deletion in mouse CD4+T cells or the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in mouse or human T cells increased IL-9 production, whereas ectopic SIRT1 expression inhibited it. Notably, SIRT1-inhibited the differentiation of TH9 cells that regulated anti-tumor immunity and allergic pulmonary inflammation. Glycolytic activation through the mTOR-hypoxia-inducible factor-1   (HIF1  ) pathway was required for the differentiation of the TH9 cells that confer protection against tumors and are involved in allergic airway inflammation. Our results define the essential features of a SIRT1-mTOR-HIF1   signaling-coupled glycolytic pathway in inducing TH9 cell differentiation, with implications for metabolic reprogramming as an immunotherapeutic approach. Lymphocytes were isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes of mice and sorted on a FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson).

LTHSC expressing high levels of MPL showed enhanced JAK/STAT signaling and proliferation in response to THPO in vitro, and increased leukemogenic capacity in vivo compared to LTHSC with low MPL expression. Although both G0 and S-phase subpopulations were increased in MPL expressing LTHSC, LSC capacity was restricted to quiescent cells. Inhibition of MPL expression in CML LTHSC resulted in reduced THPO-induced JAK/STAT signaling and leukemogenic potential. Similar observations were made with LTHSC from CML patients. MPL expressing LTHSC demonstrated reduced sensitivity to BCR-ABL TKI treatment but demonstrated increased sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. Our studies identify MPL expression levels as a key determinant of heterogeneous leukemia-initiating capacity and drug sensitivity of CML LTHSC, and suggest that MPL-expressing CML stem cells are critical targets for therapy. To evaluate heterogeneity in LSC potential, donor LTHSC from SCL-tTA/BCR-ABL mice (200 cells/mouse) were transplanted into a cohort of congenic FVBN mice.

Despite recent advances in our understanding of the cellular and secreted factors that promote the inflammatory milieu of obesity, we have much less insight into the transcriptional pathways that drive these processes. While most attention has focused on the canonical inflammatory transcription factor NF-KB, other potentially important factors exist, including members of the interferon regultory factor (IRF) family. Here we show that IRF3 expression is upregulated in the adipocytes of obese mice and humans. TLR3/TLR4 activation induces insulin resistance in adipocytes, which can be prevented by IRF3 knockdown. Furthermore, Irf3KO mice display improved insulin sensitivity, associated with reduced intra-adipose and systemic inflammation in the high-fat fed state, enhanced browning of subcutaneous fat, and increased adipose expression of Glut4. Taken together, our data indicates that IRF3 is a major transcriptional regulator of adipose inflammation to maintain systemic glucose and energy homeostasis.

The characterization of the precise functions of the TFs that regulate blood formation is essential to understand how these mechanisms are altered in malignancies. We have found that Engrailed-2 becomes methylated in the progression to blast crises of T-cell phenotype in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in human samples. Subsequently we found that En2 is expressed during T-cell development in the mouse and in humans. Engrailed-2 plays an essential role in central nervous system development but it has not been shown to participate in haematopoiesis. Many TFs have been found to play essential functions both in nervous system and blood development, thus making En2 a likely candidate to be involved in haematopoiesis. We have studied haematopoiesis of wild-type vs. En2 knockout mice. To increase our understanding of the possible molecular role(s) of En2 during T cell development, we have compared by microarray analysis the gene expression patterns of En2-/- versus WT sorted DP thymocytes and also CD8+ splenocytes (the two populations in which we had detected En2 expression).

Parameters determining the specificity and extent of mRNA degradation within the entire inflammation-associated transcriptome remain incompletely understood. Using transcriptome-wide high resolution occupancy assessment of the mRNA-destabilizing protein TTP, a major inflammation-limiting factor, we qualitatively and quantitatively characterize TTP binding positions and functionally relate them to TTP-dependent mRNA decay in immunostimulated macrophages. We identify pervasive TTP binding with incompletely penetrant linkage to mRNA destabilization. A necessary but not sufficient feature of TTP-mediated mRNA destabilization is binding to 3    untranslated regions (UTRs). Mapping of binding positions of the mRNA-stabilizing protein HuR in activated macrophages revealed that TTP and HuR binding sites in 3    UTRs occur mostly in different transcripts implicating only a limited co-regulation of inflammatory mRNAs by these proteins. Remarkably, we identify robust and widespread TTP binding to introns of stable transcripts. Nuclear TTP is associated with spliced-out introns and maintained in the nucleus throughout the inflammatory response. Our study establishes a functional annotation of binding positions dictating TTP-dependent mRNA decay in immunostimulated macrophages. The findings allow navigating the transcriptome-wide landscape of RNA elements controlling inflammation. Experiment comparing RNA decay rates in WT and TTP-/- macrophages at LPS 3 h and 6 h.

Herein we demonstrate that smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific knockout of Oct4 within atherosclerotic mice resulted in increased lesion size and multiple changes consistent with decreased plaque stability. SMC-lineage tracing studies showed that lesions from SMC-specific conditional Oct4 KO mice had a reduced number of SMCs likely due to impaired SMC migration. RNA-seq analysis of lesion specimens showed that loss of Oct4 in SMCs was associated with marked activation of genes associated with inflammation and suppression of genes associated with cell migration, a number of which were shown to be activated in cultured SMCs by the combination of hypoxia and oxidized phospholipids in an OCT4-dependent manner. Activation of Oct4 within SMCs was associated with hydroxymethylation of the Oct4 promoter and was HIF1  - and KLF4-dependent. Results provide the first genetic evidence that OCT4 plays a functional role in somatic cells and highlight the importance of further investigation of possible OCT4 functions in somatic cells.

The spontaneously active GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. A depolarizing "leak" current supports this firing pattern, but its molecular basis remains poorly understood. To understand how SNr neurons maintain tonic activity, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual SNr neurons. We discovered that SNr neurons express the sodium leak current, NaLCN and that SNr neurons lacking NaLCN have impaired spontaneous firing.

Using a network built from genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptomic profiling of sorted oligodendrocyte lineage cells that integrates oligodendrocyte-specific ChIP-Seq data, we defined a crucial role of DNA methylation in coordinating the transition between progenitor cell cycle arrest and oligodendrocyte differentiation. We further identified DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) as key regulator of oligodendrocyte survival at this transition point, as we detected severe and extensive developmental hypomyelination only in Olig1cre/+;Dnmt1flox/flox but not in Olig1cre/+;Dnmt3aflox/flox mice  or in Cnpcre/+;Dnmt1flox/flox. This phenotype was characterized by decreased expression of genes regulating myelination and lipid metabolism     despite the hypomethylation observed at these genetic loci       and upregulation of cell cycle and DNA-damage pathways. Therefore DNMT1 is a nodal point regulating proliferation, survival, and differentiation in the oligodendrocyte lineage, and is critical for cell number regulation in the developing brain. mRNA profiles of FAC-sorted P2 Pdgfra::GFP and P18 Plp1-GFP purified cell samples from mouse brains were generated by RNA-sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. ..

Here, we report that this phenomenon is not simply a consequence of loss of DNA methylation. By exploiting conditional deletions of Dnmt1 and Np95, each of which is essential for maintenance methylation, we find that while IAPs are indeed de-repressed in Dnmt1-ablated embryos and embryonic stem cells (ESCs), these proviruses remain silenced in Np95-ablated cells, despite similar kinetics of passive demethylation. Paradoxically, transient IAP activation in Dnmt1-ablated ESCs requires the presence of NP95. We subsequently show that in the absence of NP95, the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 maintains IAP silencing; while in the absence of DNMT1, prolonged binding of NP95 to hemimethylated DNA perturbs SETDB1-dependent H3K9me3 deposition. Taken together, these observations reveal that following acute loss of Dnmt1, H3K9 methylation-dependent IAP silencing is disrupted by aberrant NP95 binding to hemimethylated DNA.

However, it is unclear how Msi2 recognizes and regulates mRNA targets in vivo and whether Msi2 primarily controls cell growth in all cell types. Here we identified Msi2 targets with HITSCLIP and revealed that Msi2 primarily recognizes mRNA 3UTRs at sites enriched in multiple copies of UAG motifs in epithelial progenitor cells. RNA-seq and ribosome profiling demonstrated that Msi2 promotes targeted mRNA decay without affecting translation efficiency. Unexpectedly, the most prominent Msi2 targets identified are key regulators that govern cell motility with a high enrichment in focal adhesion and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, in addition to regulators of cell growth and survival. Loss of Msi2 stimulates epithelial cellmigration, increases the number of focal adhesion and also compromises cell growth. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Msi2   s recognition and repression of targets and uncover a key function of Msi2 in restricting epithelial cell migration.

In CN-AML with poorer prognosis, mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) commonly co-occur (1-3). We demonstrate that mice with Flt3-internal-tandem duplication (Flt3ITD) and inducible deletion of Dnmt3a spontaneously develop a rapidly-lethal, completely-penetrant, and transplantable AML of normal karyotype. These murine AML retain a single Dnmt3a floxed allele, revealing the oncogenic potential of Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency. FLT3-ITD/DNMT3A-mutant primary human and murine AML demonstrate a similar pattern of global DNA methylation. In the murine model, rescuing DNMT3A expression was accompanied by DNA re-methylation and loss of clonogenic potential, suggesting that Dnmt3a-mutant oncogenic effects are reversible.  Differentially methylated genomic regions were associated with changes in the expression of nearby genes. Moreover, dissection of the cellular architecture of the AML model using single-cell RNA-Seq, flow cytometry and colony assays identified clonogenic subpopulations that differentially express genes that are sensitive to the methylation of nearby genomic loci and varied in response to Dnmt3a levels. Thus, Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency transforms Flt3ITD myeloproliferative disease by modulating methylation-sensitive gene expression within a clonogenic AML subpopulation.

Loss of UTX in female mice is embryonic lethal. Unexpectedly, male UTX-null mice escape embryonic lethality due to expression of UTY, a paralog lacking H3K27-demethylase activity. This suggests that UTX plays an enzyme-independent role in development, and challenges the need for active H3K27-demethylation in vivo. However, the requirement for active H3K27-demethylation in stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration remains untested. Using an inducible mouse knockout that ablates UTX in satellite cells, we show that active H3K27-demethylation is necessary for muscle regeneration. Indeed, loss of UTX in satellite cells blocks myofiber regeneration in both male and female mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UTX mediates muscle regeneration through its H3K27-demethylase activity using a chemical inhibitor, and a demethylase-dead UTX knock-in mouse. Mechanistically, dissection of the muscle regenerative process revealed that UTX is required for expression of the transcription factor Myogenin that drives differentiation of muscle progenitors. Thus, we have identified a critical role for the enzymatic activity of UTX in activating muscle-specific gene expression during myofiber regeneration, revealing for the first time that active H3K27-demethylation has a physiological role in vivo.

[RNA expression]|Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can develop from alterations in hippocampal structure and circuit characteristics, and can be modeled in mice by administration of kainic acid (KA). Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) contributes to hippocampal functions and has been reported to contribute to the development of TLE. Some of the phenotypical changes include neural stem and precursor cells (NPSC) apoptosis, shortly after their birth, before they produce hippocampal neurons. Here we explored these early phenotypical changes in the DG 3 days after systemic KA administration to mice. Our specific aim was to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying altered apoptosis levels in NSPC following KA-induced status epilepticus (KA-SE). Accordingly, we chose a multi-omics experimental setup and analyzed DG tissue samples using proteomics, transcriptomics and microRNA profiling techniques. We here present a description of how these date were obtained and provide them to others for further analysis and validation.

The primitive endoderm is an extraembryonic lineage established alongside the pluripotent epiblast in the blastocyst, and is the progenitor pool for extraembryonic endoderm stem (XEN) cells. Several studies have shown that endodermal genes are upregulated in fibroblasts undergoing reprogramming, although whether endodermal genes promote or inhibit acquisition of pluripotency is unclear. We show that, in fibroblasts undergoing conventional reprogramming, OSKM-induced expression of endodermal genes leads to formation of induced XEN (iXEN) cells, which possess key properties of blastocyst-derived XEN cells, including morphology, transcription profile, self-renewal, and multipotency. Our data show that iXEN cells arise in parallel to iPS cells, indicating that OSKM are sufficient to drive cells to two distinct fates during reprogramming.

However, previous studies reported that a subset of osteosarcomas also harbor EWS-ETS family fusion, suggesting that the fusion gene may be involved in the development of a particular type of osteosarcomas. Here using the doxycycline inducible EWS-FLI1 system, we established an EWS-FLI1-dependent osteosarcoma model from murine bone marrow stromal cells. We revealed that the withdrawal of EWS-FLI1 expression enhances the osteogenic differentiation of sarcoma cells, leading to mature bone formation. Taking advantage of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, we also showed that the sarcoma-derived iPSCs with cancer-related genetic abnormalities exhibited the impaired differentiation program of osteogenic lineage irrespective of the EWS-FLI1 expression. Finally, we demonstrated that EWS-FLI1 contributed to in vitro sarcoma development from the sarcoma-iPSCs after osteogenic differentiation. These findings demonstrated that modulating cellular differentiation is fundamental principle of the EWS-FLI1-induced osteosarcoma development. Furthermore, the in vitro cancer model using sarcoma-iPSCs should provide a novel platform for dissecting relationship between cancer genome and cellular differentiation.

Method : By high speed cell sorting, we isolated primary MCs (Lin- SCA1+ cells) from mouse thymus, bone and skin. We extracted their respective total RNA and compared their transcriptome by high-throughput RNA-sequencing. Results : We found a total of 2036 differentially expressed genes (FC>5, p-adj<0.1 and RPKM>1) between the 3 MC populations. IPA analyses revealed that each MC population was enriched for genes associated to phagocyte chemotaxis. We also denoted 2850 genes with shared expression across MC populations. IPA analysis of those shared genes also revealed an enrichment for genes influencing phagocyte migration, chemotaxis and function. Finally, MC transcriptomes showed that all 3 MC populations were expressing genes associated with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) support, strongly suggesting that MCs from thymic, bone and skin all possess the ability to support HSPCs. Conclusion : Overall, our study highlighted 3 potential novel roles for tMCs : 1) Promoting macrophage/monocyte chemotaxis, 2) Enhacing the apoptotic cell clearance process and 3) setting an inviting niche for hematopoietic progenitors. These novel biological roles for tMCs could have substantial effets on thymic biology.

The use of estrogen only hormone replacement therapy increases ovarian cancer risk. Despite estrogen   s influence in OVCA, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) typically demonstrate only a 20% response rate. This low response could be due to a variety of factors including the loss of estrogen receptor signaling or the role of estrogen receptor signaling in different potential cell types of origin. The response of fallopian tube epithelium to SERMs is not known, and would be useful when determining therapeutic options for tumors that arise from this cell type, such as high-grade serous cancer. Using normal murine derived oviductal epithelial cells (mouse equivalent to the fallopian tube) estrogen receptor expression was confirmed and interaction with its ligand, estradiol, triggered mRNA and protein induction of progesterone receptor (PR).  The SERMs 4-hydroxytamoxifen, raloxifene and desmethylarzoxifene, functioned as estrogen receptor antagonists in the oviductal cells. Cellular proliferation and migration assays suggested that estradiol does not significantly impact cellular migration and increased proliferation in CD1, but not in FVB derived cell lines. Further, using RNAseq, the oviduct specific transcriptional genes targets of estrogen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen signaling were determined and validated. The RNA-seq revealed enrichment in proliferation, anti-apoptosis, calcium signaling and steroid signaling processes. Finally, the ER and PR receptor status of a panel of HGSC cell lines was investigated highlighting the need for better models of estrogen responsive HGSC cell lines. Murine oviductal epithelial cells from the FVB background were hormone starved for 48 hours (with a media change after 24 hours), then treated in triplicate with solvent control (DMSO) (0.1%), 1 nM 17-betaestradiol or 100 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 24 hours.

Here, we investigate the function of H2A.Z.1 mono-ubiquitylation (H2A.Z.1ub) by mutation of the PRC1 target residues (H2A.Z.1K3R3). We show that H2A.Z.1K3R3 is properly incorporated at target promoters in murine ESCs (mESCs), however, loss of mono-ubiquitylation leads to de-repression of bivalent genes, loss of Polycomb binding, and to faulty lineage commitment. Using quantitative proteomics, we find that tandem bromodomain proteins, including the BET family member Brd2, are enriched in H2A.Z.1 chromatin. We further show that Brd2 is gained at de-repressed promoters in H2A.Z.1K3R3 mESCs whereas Brd2 inhibition restores gene silencing at these sites. Together, our study reveals an antagonistic relationship between H2A.Z.1ub and Brd2 to regulate the transcriptional balance at bivalent genes to enable proper execution of developmental programs. RNA-Seq analysis on mouse embryonic stem cells harboring H2A.Z or H2A.Z.K3R3 (3 C-terminal lysines mutated to arginines) tagged with YFP, in the presence of a knockdown hairpin targeting the endogenous H2A.Z transcript. ..

The H2AZ.K3R3 mutant is a triple point mutant in the C-terminus of H2AZ with replacement of K119,K120, K123 with arginines, with the GFP in this vector being replaced by YFP, such that it is in frame C-terminal to the cDNA. EcoRI and XbaI digestion was performed to place H2AZ, AP3 and H2A cDNA in frame. This vector contains a CMV-promoter driven by an rtTA drug inducible system. The resulting lentiviral constructs were transfected into 293 cells using the protocol outlined by the RNAi consortium (BROAD Institute, http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/). The viral supernatant generated 48hrs after transfection was used to infect KH2 ESCs (Beard, 2006) to generate wildtype and mutant H2AZ transgenic ESC lines. The YFP transgenic ESCs were induced with 1?g/ml of doxycycline and FACS sorted for YFP positive cells. In order to study the selective impact of the H2AZ mutants, lentiviral constructs expressing short hairpins specifically directed at the 3? UTR of endogenous H2AZ were introduced into the wild-type and mutant H2AZ transgenic KH2 ESC lines using RNA. Sequences of the different H2AZ 3?UTR-directed hairpin oligos are as follows: sh#2 5?- AACAGCTGTCCAGTGTTGGTG-3?; sh#5 5?- AATTAGCCTTCCAACCAACCA-3?. Hairpin oligos were annealed and cloned into pLKO.1 vector (Sigma) as detailed by the RNAi consortium, BROAD (http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/trc/lib). Blasticidin was used as a selection marker for the generation of endogenous H2AZ-depleted transgenic KH2 ESCs. The puromycin marker in the pLKO.1 vector was removed by digestion with BamHI and KpnI and replaced with blasticidin. The blasticidin cDNA was PCR amplified from pLenti6.2/V5-DEST Gateway? Vector (Invitrogen). V6.5 (129SvJae and C57BL/6) and the YFP transgenic ESCs were cultured as previously described (Boyer et al., 2006). The endogenous H2AZ-depleted transgenic KH2 ESCs were similarly cultured with the addition of blasticidin (5?g/ml) on blasticidin-resistant feeder cells (Iuchi, 2006).;

Here we show that PRC2 is a critical regulator of Kras-driven non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression. Modulation of PRC2 by either Ezh2 overexpression or Eed deletion enhances Kras-driven adenomagenesis and inflammation, respectively. Eed-loss-driven inflammation leads to massive macrophage recruitment and marked decline in tissue function. Additional Trp53 inactivation activates a cell autonomous epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program leading to an invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. A switch between methylated/acetylated chromatin underlies the tumor phenotypic evolution, prominently involving genes controlled by Hippo/Wnt-signaling. Our observations in the mouse models were conserved in human cells. Importantly, PRC2 inactivation results in context-dependent phenotypic alterations, with implications for its therapeutic application. We generated ChIP-seq from primary Kras;p53 (KP) cells in culture with and without Eed (KPE) and from KP primary tumors generated by injection of NSCLC into the tail vein.

Given that DNA damage can also trigger production of type I interferons (IFN) that contribute to senescence development, we sought to determine the role of IFN in the oncogene-induced senescence. Our data in mouse model demonstrate that inactivation of IFN signaling is sufficient for inducing melanomas in melanocytes harboring mutant Braf. Restoration of IFN signaling in IFN-deficient melanoma cells induces cell senescence and suppresses melanoma progression. In addition, data in human patients that received high dose IFN therapy and in mouse transplanted tumor models strongly suggest the importance of the non-cell-autonomous IFN signaling. Suppression of IFN signaling mediated by the downregulation of IFN receptor IFNAR1 invariably occurs during development of mouse melanoma. Mice harboring the IFNAR1 mutant, which is relatively resistant to downregulation, delay melanoma development, suppress the metastatic disease, and better respond to treatment with BRAF or PD1 inhibitors. These results suggest that IFN signaling is an important tumor suppressive pathway that inhibits melanoma development and progression. Accordingly, the inhibition of IFN pathway via IFNAR1 downregulation plays a key role in melanoma pathogenesis. Conversely, these data also argue for targeting IFNAR1 downregulation to prevent the metastatic disease and improve the efficacy of molecularly targeted and immune-targeted therapies.

Using a new conditional knockout mouse, we found that Satb1 is required for normal differentiation of conventional dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, Satb1 governs the differentiation of inflammatory DCs by regulating MHC-II expression through Notch1 signaling. Mechanistically, Satb1 binds to the Notch1 promoter, activating Notch expression and driving RBPJ occupancy of the H2-Ab1 promoter, which activates MHC-II transcription. However, tumor-driven, unremitting expression of Satb1 in activated Zbtb46+ inflammatory DCs that universally infiltrate ovarian tumors results in an immunosuppressive phenotype characterized by increased secretion of tumor-promoting Galectin-1 and IL-6. Correspondingly, specific in vivo silencing of Satb1 in tumor-associated DCs reverses their tumorigenic activity and boosts protective immunity. Therefore, dynamic fluctuations in Satb1 expression govern the generation and immunostimulatory activity of steady-state and inflammatory DCs, but relentless Satb1 overexpression in differentiated DCs converts them into tolerogenic/pro-inflammatory cells that contribute to malignant progression.

We investigated this in an in vitro model, where na  ve pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in bFGF/ActivinA develop as epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), and gain competence for PGC-like fate5. Consequently, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4), or ectopic expression of key germline transcription factors Prdm1/ Prdm14/ Tfap2c, directly induce PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) in EpiLCs, but not in ESCs6-8. Here we report an unexpected discovery that Nanog alone can induce PGCLCs in EpiLCs, independently of BMP4. We propose that following the dissolution of the na  ve ESC pluripotency network during establishment of EpiLCs9,10, the epigenome is reset for cell fate determination. Indeed, we found genome-wide changes in NANOG binding pattern between ESCs and EpiLCs, indicating epigenetic resetting of regulatory elements. Accordingly, we show that NANOG can bind and activate enhancers of Prdm1 and Prdm14 in EpiLCs in vitro; BLIMP1 (encoded by Prdm1) then directly induces Tfap2c. Furthermore, while SOX2 and NANOG promote the pluripotent state in ESCs, they show contrasting roles in EpiLCs since Sox2 specifically represses PGCLC induction by Nanog. This study demonstrates a broadly applicable mechanistic principle for how cells acquire competence for cell fate determination, resulting in the context-dependent roles of key transcription factors during development.

Here, we describe the antral stomach as a previously unrecognized source highly amenable to conversion into functional insulin-secreting cells.  Native antral endocrine cells share a surprising degree of transcriptional similarity with pancreatic beta-cells.  Expression of beta-cell reprogramming factors in vivo converts antral cells efficiently into insulin+ cells with close molecular and functional resemblance to beta-cells.  Our data further indicate that the intestine-expressed Cdx2 acts as a molecular barrier for beta-cell conversion.  Induced GI insulin+ cells can suppress hyperglycemia over at least 6 months and they regenerate rapidly after ablation from the native stem-cell compartment.  Transplantation of bioengineered stomach mini-organs also produced insulin+ cells and suppressed hyperglycemia.  These studies demonstrate the potential of developing engineered stomach tissue as a renewable source of functional beta-cells for glycemic control.

By performing BrdU pulse-labeling studies, we found that MBC formation preceded the formation of LLPC in an adoptive transfer immunization system, which allowed for a synchronized Ag-specific response with homogeneous Ag-receptor, yet at natural precursor frequencies. We confirmed observations in wild type (WT) mice and extended them with germinal center (GC) disruption experiments and variable region gene sequencing. We thus show that the GC response undergo a temporal switch in its output as it matures, revealing that the reaction engenders both MBC subsets with different immune effector function and, ultimately, LLPC at largely separate points in time. These data demonstrate the kinetics of the formation of the cells that provide stable humoral immunity and therefore have implications for autoimmunity, vaccine development, and for understanding long-term pathogen resistance.

This approach has proven difficult in neuroscience due to the marked diversity across different neuron classes, but may also be further hampered by prominent within-class variability.  Here, we considered a well-defined, canonical neuronal population     hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells     and systematically examined the extent and spatial rules of transcriptional heterogeneity.  Using next-generation RNA sequencing, we identified striking variability in CA1 PCs, such that the differences along the dorsal-ventral axis rivaled differences across distinct pyramidal neuron classes. This variability emerged from a spectrum of continuous expression gradients, producing a profile consistent with a multifarious continuum of cells.  This work reveals an unexpected amount of variability within a canonical and narrowly defined neuronal population and suggests that continuous, within-class heterogeneity may be an important feature of neural circuits.

Akin to the other mammalian Runx genes, Runx1 has two promoters P1 (distal) and P2 (proximal) which generate distinct protein isoforms. The activities and specific relevance of these two promoters in adult hematopoiesis remain to be fully elucidated. Utilizing a dual reporter model, we demonstrate here that the distal P1 promoter is broadly active in adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) populations. By contrast, the activity of the proximal P2 promoter is more restricted and its upregulation, in both the immature Lineage- Sca1high cKithigh (LSK) and bipotential Pre-Megakaryocytic/Erythroid Progenitor (PreMegE) populations, coincides with a loss of erythroid specification. Accordingly, the PreMegE population can be prospectively separated into "pro-erythroid" and "pro-megakaryocyte" populations based on Runx1 P2 activity. Comparative gene expression analyses between Runx1 P2+ and P2- populations indicated that the level of CD34 expression could substitute for P2 activity to distinguish these two cell populations in wild type (WT) bone marrow (BM). Prospective isolation of these two populations will provide the opportunity to further investigate and define the molecular mechanisms involved in megakaryocytic/erythroid (Mk/Ery) cell fate decisions. Moreover, comparison of a RUNX1C null (KO) PreMegE to its WT counterpart demonstrated considerably enhanced erythroid specification at the expense of megakaryopoiesis in the absence of P1-specified RUNX1C expression. mRNA profiles of wild type (WT), Runx1 P2-hCD4+ (P2+), Runx1 P2-hCD4- (P2-) and RUNX1C knockout (KO) bone marrow Pre-Megakaryocyte/Erythroid (PreMegE) progenitors were generated from young adult (12-16 weeks) mice by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina NextSeq 500. .. 12-16 weeks;  PreMegE;  Runx1 P2-hCD4+ PreMegE;  Runx1 P2-hCD4- PreMegE;  RUNX1C knockout;  Runx1 P1-GFP::P2-hCD4/+;  wild type;  total RNA;  Bone marrow Pre-Megakaryocyte/Erythroid progenitor, KO;  Bone marrow Pre-Megakaryocyte/Erythroid progenitor, P2+;  Bone marrow Pre-Megakaryocyte/Erythroid progenitor, P2-;  Bone marrow Pre-Megakaryocyte/Erythroid progenitor, WT;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  adult bone marrow;

Indeed, our genome-wide studies demonstrate that Aff3 specifically binds both imprinting control regions (ICRs) and enhancers within imprinted loci in an allele-specific manner. We have identified the molecular regulators involved in the recruitment of Aff3 to ICRs to impede transcription through the ICR, and provide a mechanism requiring Aff3 within the Super Elongation Complex-like 3 (SEC-L3) in the expression of an imprinted polycistronic transcript spanning the Dlk1-Dio3 locus.

Recently, it has been discovered that the injured heart is enriched with c-kit+ cells, which also express the hematopoietic marker CD45. In this study, we characterize the phenotype and transcriptome of the c-kit+/CD45+ cell population, originating from the left atrial appendage. These cells are defined as cardiac macrophage progenitors. We also demonstrate that the c-kit+/CD45+ progenitor cell population activates heart development, neural crest and pluripotency associated pathways in vitro, in conjunction with CD45 down-regulation, and acquire a c-kit+/lin- phenotype. This spontaneous reprogramming progresses further to a highly proliferative, partially myogenic phenotype. Our data suggests that c-kit+/lin- cells and cardiac macrophages have a common lineage origin possibly resolving some current conundrums in the field of cardiac regeneration.

In mice, paternal consumption of low protein diet alters cholesterol and lipid metabolism of progeny. Here, we examine RNA species expressed in male reproductive tissues of mice. Protein restriction leads to altered levels of multiple small RNAs in mature sperm, as well as throughout the male reproductive tract, with decreased levels of let-7 family members and increased levels of 5    fragments of tRNA-Gly isoacceptors. Intriguingly, tRNA fragments are scarce in the testis, but their levels increase in sperm during post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. We find that epididymosomes     extracellular vesicles which fuse with sperm during epididymal transit     exhibit RNA payloads closely matching those of mature sperm, and can deliver tRNA fragments to immature sperm in vitro both in mouse and in bull. Finally, we show that tRNA-Gly-GCC fragments play a role in repressing genes associated with the endogenous retroelement MERVL, both in ES cells and in preimplantation embryos. Our results shed light on small RNA biogenesis during post-testicular sperm maturation, and link tRNA fragments to regulation of endogenous retroelements active in the early embryo.

Major efforts have been made to characterize the molecular events involved in this process. Yet, it remains elusive how gene expression change, epigenetic landscape remodelling and cell fate conversion are triggered by expression of these Yamanaka factors. To address this gap, we utilized a secondary inducible reprogramming system and performed genome-wide profilings of Oct4 binding, histone modification (H3K4me3/H3K27me3/H3K4me1/H3K27ac), and gene expression analysis during this process. Through integrative analysis, we revealed stage-specific Oct4 binding and enhancer signatures in consistence with gene expression changes, in which the initial regression of somatic program is followed by the gradual acquisition of pluripotent program. Oct4 preferatially binds to H3K4me1 marked enhancer regions and Oct4 binding is positively correlated with active mark H3K27ac. Moreover, we observed significant enhancer activation of epigenetic related genes, especially acetylation associated genes, prior to pluripotency network activation, suggesting a pivotal role of epigenetic remodelling in the process of pluripotency acquisition and maintenance.

In this context, the key players of liver regeneration immediately after injury have not been adequately studied. Using an in vitro liver culture system, we show that after liver injury, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2)  and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (Erk)1/2  were activated within 15 min and continued to be phosphorylated for more than 2 h. Both p38MAPK and Erk1/2 were activated at the edge of the cut as well as on the liver surface where the mesothelial cell sheet expresses several cytokines. Notably, in human liver Erk1/2 was also activated under the mesothelial cell sheet shortly after liver resections. Furthermore, in in vitro liver slice culture immediate early genes (IEGs) were upregulated within 1-2 h and the S phase marker proliferation-cell-nuclear-antigen (PCNA) appeared 24 h after injury. Although Erk1/2 was activated after injury, in MK2 depleted liver a set of IEGs, such as Dusp1, Cox2, or c-Myc and proliferation marker gene Ki67 were not induced. In addition, in immortalized hepatocyte cells, THLE-2, the same subset of genes was upregulated upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but not in the presence of MK2 inhibitor. The protein level of tristetraprolin (TTP), a substrate for MK2 that plays a role in mRNA degradation, was increased in the presence of MK2 inhibitor. In this context, the depletion of TTP gene rescued Dusp1, Cox2, or c-Myc upregulation in the presence of MK2 inhibitor. These data imply that MK2 pathway is positively involved in Erk1/2 induced IEG response after liver injury. These data also suggest that in vitro liver culture may be a useful tool for measuring the proliferation potential of hepatocytes in individual liver.

The latter mechanism deletes an interstitial region of ~3Mb and it remains largely unanswered whether genes deleted within this region contribute to prostate cancer. By characterizing two knockin mouse models recapitulating TMPRSS2-ERG fusions with or without the interstitial deletion, we found that only those with deletion developed poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, when under a Pten-null background. We identified several interstitial genes, including ETS2 and BACE2, whose reduced expression correlates with worse disease-free survival and lethal disease. By using an Ets2 conditional knockout allele, we demonstrated that loss of one copy of Ets2 was sufficient for prostate cancer progression when under a Pten-null background. Collectively, our data suggest that ETS2 is a prostate tumor suppressor and haploinsufficiency of one or more interstitial genes contributes to prostate cancer progression. Genotyped male mice were euthanized at 12 months of age and prostates isolated. Prostates were fixed overnight in 10% formalin and stored in 70% ethanol until tissue processing and paraffin embedding.

Using Affymetrix mouse 1.0 ST array platform, we obtained and analyzed the transcriptome data for significantly changed genes in expression. Here, we identified 446 genes and categorized the genes based on their biological roles. We observed gradual down-regulation of several signaling pathways including insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-  ) and canonical Wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt) signaling according to the CR strengths. Many genes related to structural feature including extracellular matrix (ECM), cell adhesion and cytoskeleton were also down-regulated with a strong correlation to the serial CR treatments. Furthermore, genes for cell cycle and adipogenesis were down-regulated. According to previous studies, these are target functions of the aforementioned four signaling pathways. On the other hand, the genes for specific metabolic features including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) exhibited a transcriptional increase. In addition, adipose tissue expansion markers such as leptin, Mesoderm specific transcript (Mest) and Secreted frizzled-related sequence protein 5 (Sfrp5), and most genes for transport and immune response showed a down-regulation by CR.

The transcription factor Nkx2-1, essential for lung cell differentiation, mainly acts in transcriptional activation but can directly or indirectly repress gene expression. microRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA that control one of the major mechanisms of gene repression. To identify miRNAs regulated by Nkx2-1 that may mediate its repressing effects, we knocked-down Nkx2-1 in mouse lung epithelial cell lines and systematically identified targets by genome-wide miR and mRNA expression analyses. Nkx2-1 controls expression of miRs known to contribute to lung cell differentiation in development and disease and others not previously described. Amongst the significantly altered miRs, the mir-106a-363 cluster, miR-1195, miR-378, and miR-346 are directly correlated with the levels of Nkx2-1, whereas miR-200c/b, miR-221, and miR- 222 are inversely correlated. These miRNAs are expressed in embryonic lung at day E11.5, and/or E19.5 determined by in-situ hybridization. Expression of predicted targets of mir-1195, mir-346 and miR-200c and mir-221/222 were evaluated by mRNA expression microarrays in Nkx2-1 knockdown cells identifying those anti-correlated to the corresponding miRNA expression. Genes regulated by mir-1195, Cyp2s1 and Map3k2, by mir-346, Klf6, and miR-200c, Myb, Nfib, and Six1, were validated by qRT-PCR. Inhibition of mir-1195 confirms the inverse correlation of this miRNA with its putative targets Cyp2s1 and Map3k2. This miRNA-mRNA expression analysis identifies potential paths of Nkx2-1 mediated gene repression, and contributes to the understanding of gene regulation in lung epithelial differentiation and development.

We find that one microRNA, microRNA-218, is highly enriched and abundantly expressed in motoneurons.  Furthermore, we find that miR-218 is transcribed from alternative, motoneuron-specific alternative promoters embedded within the Slit2 and Slit3 genes by performing RNA sequencing of FACS-isolated motoneurons and a dissected embryonic floor plate cells which served as a control.  Next, we performed RNA sequencing of FACS-isolated wild type (WT) motoneurons and motoneurons lacking miR-218 expression (218DKO motoneurons), and find that a large set of genes (named 'TARGET218' genes) with predicted miR-218 binding sites are de-repressed in the absence of miR-218 expression.  Finally, we examine the expression of TARGET218 genes in other neuronal subpopulations by FACS-isolating  V1, V2a, and V3 interneurons expressing Cre-inducible fluorescent reporters and performing RNA sequencing.

Chromatin has the potential to restrict accessibility of binding sites; however, in which context chromatin states are instructive for TF binding remains mainly unknown. To explore the contribution of DNA methylation to constrained TF binding, we mapped DNase-I-hypersensitive sites in murine stem cells in the presence and absence of DNA methylation. Methylation-restricted sites are enriched for TF motifs containing CpGs, especially for those of NRF1. In fact, the TF NRF1 occupies several thousand additional sites in the unmethylated genome, resulting in increased transcription. Restoring de novo methyltransferase activity initiates remethylation at these sites and outcompetes NRF1 binding. This suggests that binding of DNA-methylationsensitive TFs relies on additional determinants to induce local hypomethylation. In support of this model, removal of neighbouring motifs in cis or of a TF in trans causes local hypermethylation and subsequent loss of NRF1 binding. This competition between DNA methylation and TFs in vivo reveals a case of cooperativity between TFs that acts indirectly via DNA methylation. Methylation removal by methylation-insensitive factors enables occupancy of methylation-sensitive factors, a principle that rationalizes hypomethylation of regulatory regions.

MDMA   s acute cardiotoxicity includes tachycardia and arrhythmia which are associated with cardiomyopathy (CM). MDMA acute cardiotoxicity has been explored, but neither long-term MDMA cardiac pathological changes nor epigenetic changes have been evaluated.  Microarray analyses were employed to identify cardiac gene expression changes and epigenetic DNA methylation changes. To identify permanent MDMA-induced pathogenetic changes, mice received daily 10d or 35d MDMA , or daily 10d MDMA followed by 25d saline washout (10+25d).  MDMA treatment (10d) caused differentially gene expression (p<0.05, fold change >1.5), with 752 genes 558 genes following 35d MDMA, and 113 genes following 10d treatment +25d washout.  Changes in MAPK and circadian rhythm gene expression were identified following 10d administration.  After 35d, circadian rhythm genes (Per3, CLOCK, ARNTL, and NPAS2) remained differentially expressed.  MDMA caused DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation that was independent of gene expression; hypermethylation of genes was 71% at 10d, 68% at 35d, and 91% at 10+25d.  Differential gene expression that corresponded directly with DNA methylation changes occurred in 22% of genes at 10d, 17% at 35d, and 48% at 10d+25d washout.  MDMA treatment resulted in epigenetic changes in cardiac DNA methylation. Hypermethylation was the predominant effect.  MDMA induced gene expression of key elements of circadian rhythm regulatory genes and suggest a fundamental mechanism for MDMA dysfunction in the heart.

As the principal cell type supporting bacterial replication, epithelial cells are central to Chlamydia immunobiology initially as sentries and innate defenders, and subsequently as collaborators in adaptive immunity-mediated bacterial clearance.  In asymptomatic individuals who do not seek medical care a decisive struggle between C. trachomatis and host defenses occurs at the epithelial interface.  For this study we modeled the immunobiology of epithelial cells and macrophages lining healthy genital mucosa and inflamed/infected mucosa during the transition from innate to adaptive immunity.  Upper reproductive tract epithelial cell line responses were compared to bone marrow-derived macrophages utilizing gene expression microarray technology.  Those comparisons showed minor differences in the intrinsic innate defenses of macrophages and epithelial cells.  Major lineage-specific differences in immunobiology relate to epithelial collaboration with adaptive immunity including an epithelial requirement for inflammatory cytokines to express MHC class II molecules, and a paucity and imbalance between costimulatory and coinhibitory ligands on epithelial cells that potentially limits sterilizing immunity (replication termination) to Chlamydia-specific T cells activated with limited or unconventional second signals. 2 mouse reproductive tract epithelial cell lines compared to bone marrow macrophages untreated vs. treated with inflammatory supernatant (4 replicates each).Contributor: The Indiana University Center for Medical Genomics- Jeanette McClintick ..

A remarkable heterogeneity in peripheral Treg cells has been evidenced and underscored the need to better characterize them and compare their suppressive function to determine which Treg subset will be optimally suitable for a given clinical situation.   We demonstrated that repetitive injections of immature dendritic cells (DC) expand FoxP3-negative CD49b+ Treg cells that display an effector memory phenotype. Transcriptome analysis of ex-vivo isolated Treg-expanded by DC injections contains multiple transcripts of the canonical Treg signature shared mainly by CD25+ but also by other Treg subphenotypes. We provided an in-depth characterization of the CD49b+ Treg cells phenotype underscoring their similarities with CD25+ Treg cells and highlighting some specific expression pattern for several markers including LAG3, KLRG1, CD103, ICOS, CTLA-4 and GZB. Comparison of their suppressive mechanism in vitro and in vivo with that of FoxP3-positive Treg cells provide evidence of their potent suppressive activity in vivo, partly dependent on IL-10 secretion. Altogether our results underscore the therapeutic potential of IL-10 secreting CD49b+ Treg cells in arthritis and strongly suggest that expression of several canonical markers and suppressive function could be FoxP3-independent All gene expression profiles were obtained from highly purified T cell populations sorted by flow cytometry.

By combining ribosome affinity purification and high-throughput sequencing, a cascade of mutant SOD1-dependent, cell type-specific changes are now identified. Initial mutant-dependent damage is restricted to motor neurons and includes synapse and metabolic abnormalities, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and selective activation of the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response. PERK activation correlates with what we identify to be a naturally low level of ER chaperones in motor neurons. Early changes in astrocytes are to genes involved in inflammation and metabolism and that are targets of the PPAR and LXR transcription factors. Dysregulation of myelination and lipid signaling pathways and activation of ETS transcription factors occur in oligodendrocytes only after disease initiation. Thus, pathogenesis involves a temporal cascade of cell type selective damage initiating in motor neurons, with subsequent damage within glia driving disease propagation.

Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or polarized in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic differentiation conditions. Computational analysis reveals a spectrum of cellular states in vivo, including a self-renewal state, Th1-like effector/memory states and a dysfunctional/senescent state. Relating these states to in vitro differentiated Th17 cells, unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four novel genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity, and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.

Here, we show an alternative and previously unknown bivalent modified histone signature in lineage-committed mesenchymal stem cells and preadipocytes that pairs H3K4me3 with H3K9me3 to maintain adipogenic master regulatory genes (Cebpa and Pparg) expressed at low levels yet poised for activation when differentiation is required. We show lineage-specific gene-body DNA methylation recruits H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 which methylates H3K9 immediately downstream of transcription start sites marked with H3K4me3 to establish the bivalent domain. At the Cebpa locus, this prevents transcription factor C/EBP   binding, histone acetylation, and further H3K4me3 deposition and is associated with pausing of RNA polymerase II, which limits Cebpa gene expression and adipogenesis.

Here we show that the key haematopoietic LIM-domain-binding protein-1 (LDB1) TF complex contains several activator and repressor components that together maintain an erythroid-specific gene expression programme primed for rapid activation until differentiation is induced. A combination of proteomics, functional genomics and in vivo studies presented here identifies known and novel co-repressors, most notably the ETO2 and IRF2BP2 proteins, involved in maintaining this primed state. The ETO2   IRF2BP2 axis, interacting with the NCOR1/SMRT co-repressor complex, suppresses the expression of the vast majority of archetypical erythroid genes and pathways until its decommissioning at the onset of terminal erythroid differentiation. Our experiments demonstrate that multimeric regulatory complexes feature a dynamic interplay between activating and repressing components that determines lineage-specific gene expression and cellular differentiation.

Male and female hNAG-1 expressing mice have reduced body weight, increased longevity and metabolic activity. This study investigates the role of hNAG-1 in female reproduction and finds that the female mice have reduced fertility and pup survival after birth. Examination of the mammary glands in these mice suggests that hNAG-1 overexpressing mice have altered mammary epithelial development during pregnancy, including reduced occupancy of the fat pad and increased apoptosis via TUNEL positive cells at lactation day 2. Pups nursing from hNAG-1 overexpressing dams have reduced milk spots compared to pups nursing from WT dams. When CD-1 pups were cross-fostered with hNAG-1 or WT dams; reduced milk volume was observed in pups nursing from hNAG-1 dams compared to pups nursing from WT dams in a lactation challenge study. Milk was isolated from WT and hNAG-1 dams, and the milk was found to have secreted NAG-1 protein (approximately 25ng/mL) from hNAG-1 dams compared to WT dams, which had no detectable NAG-1 in the milk. A decrease in non-esterified free fatty acids in the milk of hNAG-1 dams was observed. Altered milk composition suggests that the pups were receiving inadequate nutrients during perinatal development; to examine this hypothesis serum was isolated from pups and clinical chemistry points were measured. Male and female pups nursing from hNAG-1 dams had reduced serum triglyceride concentrations. Cidea/CIDEA expression was reduced in hNAG-1 mammary glands, and microarray analysis suggests that genes involved in lipid metabolism are differentially expressed in hNAG-1 mammary glands.

Its N-terminus binds BCL9/9L proteins, which bind co-activators that in mammals contribute to fine-tuning the transcriptional output. We found that a BCL9/9L-dependent gene expression signature was strongly associated with patient outcome in colorectal cancer and that stem cell and mesenchymal genes determine its prognostic value. Abrogating BCL9/9L-  -catenin signaling in independent mouse colorectal cancer models resulted in virtual loss of these traits, and oncogenic intestinal organoids lacking BCL9/9L proteins proved no longer tumorigenic. Our findings suggest that the BCL9/9L arm of Wnt-  -catenin signaling sustains a stemness-to-differentiation equilibrium in colorectal cancer, which critically affects disease outcome. Mutational activation of the Wnt pathway is a key oncogenic event in colorectal cancer. Targeting the pathway downstream of activating mutations is challenging, and the therapeutic window is limited by intestinal toxicity. Contrasting with phenotypes caused by inactivating key Wnt pathway components, ablation of BCL9/9L proteins in adult mice indicated that they were dispensable for intestinal homeostasis, consistent with their role in tuning transcription. Cancer stem cells are increasingly recognized as responsible for tumor recurrence. The correlation between stemness traits in colorectal cancer models and BCL9/9L-  -catenin signaling suggests that high Wnt signaling output is required for their maintenance. Our findings suggest that pruning Wnt-  -catenin signaling might be well tolerated and prove sufficient for trimming stemness traits and improving disease outcome.

Stress, germinal and neuronal granules contain RNA-binding proteins capable of self-assembly due to prion-like domains. Hyperassembly mediated by these prion-like domains causes several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report a subset of the mammalian prion protein (PrP), also prone to self-assembly, propagation and to cause devastating diseases, is a component of naturally occurring messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) in adult mouse brains. Biomolecules co-purified with PrP revealed a multitude of diverse RNA granule associated proteins and mRNAs encoding members of the translation machinery, indicating a role in a specialized translation process. Importantly, PrP mutations linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or fatal familial insomnia (FFI) severely impaired recovery of mRNPs from preclinical mice, possibly representing a very early pathological process. Thus, mutant PrP may cause dysfunction in RNA regulation, thereby joining the constantly expanding ranks of disease associated RNP granule proteins.

The core Notch complex consists of an ICN protein, a Maml cofactor, and the DNA binding factor Rbpj. The known direct cofactors of Notch appear to act nonselectively, homogeneously driving Notch gene expression functions. It is unclear whether there are direct cofactors of Notch that act selectively and heterogeneously regulate ICN. We discovered that Zmiz1, a Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT (PIAS)-like coactivator, directly bound ICN1.  ChIP-Seq showed that Zmiz1 selectively co-bound only a subset of Notch-regulated enhancers. This led to hypothesize that Zmiz1 regulates only a subset of Notch1 target genes. To investigate this, we performed RNA-Seq on four 8946 cell linesin which L1601P (activated Notch1) or Zmiz1 were expressed alone or in combination. Zmiz1 induced  ~10% of Notch target genes. The Notch target gene that was most strongly induced by Zmiz1 was Myc. Our data suggest that Zmiz1 selectively amplifies a subset of Notch target genes with strong amplification of Myc.

Previouly, we reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression and angiotensin II level were enhanced by repeated UVB-irradiation of hairless mice skin, and ACE inhibitor enalapril maleate accelerated recovery of UVB-induced wrinkle. In present study, we analyzed gene expression with DNA microarray and protein distribution with immunofluorecence method to clarify the process of wrinkle repairing with enalapril maleate in UVB-irradiated hairless mouse.  In microarray analysis, we detected up-regulation of various extracullular matrix (ECM) genes and ECM related genes. In immunofluorescence, we confirm that type 1 collagen, fibrillin1, elastin, and dystroglycan 1 were decreased by repeated UVB-irradiation and the distribution of these components were improved by enalapril maleate treatment. In addition, ADAMTS2 and MMP-14, these were perticipate in ECM structure formation and degradation, were increased in enalapril maleate-treated mouse skin. While the functions of these molecules in skin is not clear yet, it is suggested that these molecules participate in improvement of wrinkles induced by UVB-irradiation.

Therefore, we sought to investigate if SPEM plays a role in epithelial regeneration. Methods: Acetic acid ulcers were induced in young (2-3 months) C57BL/6 mice to determine the quality of ulcer repair.  Gastric tissue was collected and analyzed to determine the expression of SPEM within the regenerating epithelium.  As a comparison to native tissue the expression of SPEM was also identified within cultured gastric mouse-derived organoids. Results:  Wound healing in the mice coincided with the emergence of SPEM expressing CD44v within the ulcerated region.  The emergence of SPEM was also observed in cultured gastric organoids.  Conclusions: These data demonstrate the SPEM may play a role in epithelial regeneration. Conclusions: These data demonstrate the SPEM may play a role in epithelial regeneration. 4 samples were used for ulcerated and uninjured tissue.  1 sample was used for intact tissue and organoid-derived RNA.The 'Ulcerated' samples represent C57BL/6 mice with ulcers and the 'Uninjured' samples represent the healthy controls (for "ulcerated" samples).

Longitudinal analysis of ulcerative colitis patients following total colectomy with ileal anal anastomosis (IPAA) where >50% develop pouchitis, offers a unique setting to examine cause vs. effect. To recapitulate human IPAA, we employed a mouse model of surgically-created blind self-filling (SFL) and self-emptying (SEL) ileal loops. SFL exhibit fecal stasis due to directional peristalsis motility  oriented towards away from the loop end, whereas SEL remain empty.  In wild type mice, SFL, but not SEL, develop pouch-like microbial communities without accompanying active inflammation. However, in genetically susceptible IL-10-/- deficient mice, SFL, but not SEL, exhibit severe inflammation and mucosal transcriptomes resembling human pouchitis. Germ-free IL10-/- mice conventionalized with wild type SFL, but not SEL, microbiota, develop severe colitis. These data demonstrate an essential role for fecal stasis, gut dysbiosis, and genetic susceptibility and offer insights into human pouchitis and ulcerative colitis. All animal protocols were approved by IACUC at the University of Chicago. All animals were C57Bl/6 mice that were bred and housed under standard 12:12 light/dark conditions at the University of Chicago. Female mice aged 6-8 weeks were fed ad libitum gel diet 76A (Cat# 72-07-5022, Clear H20, Portland, ME) for 5-days prior to surgery to prevent obstruction at the anastomosis. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine. Aseptic surgery was performed to resect 2.5cm of ileum 3cm proximal to the ileal-cecal value with anastomosis to the ileum using 8-0 suture (Figure 1a).

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase  (AID) has been recently implicated recently in DNA demethylation through its deaminase activity coupled with DNA repair.  We investigated the epigenetic function of AID in vivo in germinal center B cells (GCB) isolated from wild type (WT) and AID-deficient (Aicda-/-) mice.  We determined that the transit of B cells through the GC is associated with marked locus-specific loss of methylation and increased methylation diversity, both of which are lost in Aicda-/- animals.  Differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) between GCB and na  ve B cells (NB) are enriched in genes that are targeted for somatic hypermutation (SHM) by AID and these genes form networks required for B cell development and proliferation.

Early clinical trials have shown significant promise especially in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)3; therefore the evaluation of resistance mechanisms, an inevitable consequence of cancer therapies, is of utmost importance to optimise the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Using primary murine stem and progenitor cells immortalised with MLL-AF9, we have used an innovative approach to generate 20 cell lines derived from single cell clones demonstrating stable resistance, in vitro and in vivo, to the prototypical BET inhibitor, I-BET. Resistance to I-BET confers cross-resistance to chemically distinct BET inhibitors such as JQ1, as well as resistance to genetic knockdown of BET proteins. Resistance is not mediated through increased drug efflux or metabolism but is demonstrated to emerge from leukaemia stem cells (LSC). Resistant clones display a leukaemic granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (L-GMP) phenotype (Lin-, Sca-, cKit+, CD34+, Fc  RII/RIII+) and functionally exhibit increased clonogenic capacity in vitro and markedly shorter leukaemia latency in vivo. Chromatin bound BRD4 is globally reduced in resistant cells, however expression of key target genes such as MYC remains unaltered, highlighting the existence of alternative mechanisms to regulate transcription. We demonstrate that resistance to BET inhibitors is in part a consequence of increased Wnt/  -catenin signaling. Negative regulation of this pathway results in differentiation of resistant cells into mature leukaemic blasts, inhibition of MYC expression and restoration of sensitivity to I-BET in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that the sensitivity of primary human AML cells to I-BET correlates with the baseline expression of Wnt/  -catenin target genes. Together these findings provide novel insights into the biology of AML, highlight the potential therapeutic limitations of BET inhibitors and identify strategies that may overcome resistance and enhance the clinical utility of these unique targeted therapies.

In mammalian cells 14-3-3 colocalizes and binds DNMT1pSer143 post-DNA replication. The level of DNMT1pSer143 increased with overexpression of 14-3-3 and decreased by its depletion. Binding of 14-3-3 proteins with DNMT1pSer143 resulted in inhibition of DNA methylation activity in vitro. In addition, overexpression of 14-3-3 in NIH3T3 cells led to decrease in DNMT1 specific activity and was rescued by transfection of DNMT1. Decrease in DNMT1 specific activity led to hypomethylation of the genome. Genes representing cell migration, mobility, proliferation and focal adhesion pathway were hypomethylated and overexpressed. Furthermore, 14-3-3 overexpression also resulted in enhanced cell invasion. Therefore, we suggest that 14-3-3 is a crucial reader of DNMT1pSer143 that regulates DNMT1 level, DNA methylation and altered gene expression that contributes to cell invasion.

We use CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) to comprehensively map transcription start sites (TSSs) across different etiologies of human HCC as well as mouse HCC, with particular emphasis on ncRNAs distant from protein-coding genes. We find thousands of significantly up-regulated distal ncRNAs in HCC tumors compared to their matched non-tumors, which are as many as protein-coding genes. Moreover, we identify many LTR retroviral promoters activated in HCC tissues and expressed in a subfamily-specific manner, which account for approximately 20% of the up-regulated distal ncRNAs. The transcripts derived from LTRs, determined by 3' RACE, are multi-exon nuclear ncRNAs typically 0.5-2kb in length. This study sheds light on ncRNA transcriptome of human and mouse HCC.

Identification of epigenetic processes that contribute to ASD development and progression is of major importance and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Here we identify the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain containing transcriptional regulators (BETs) as epigenetic drivers of an ASD-like disorder in mice. We found that the pharmacological suppression of the BET proteins by a novel, highly selective and brain-permeable inhibitor, I-BET858, leads to selective suppression of neuronal gene expression followed by the development of an autism-like syndrome in mice. Many of the I-BET858 affected genes have been linked to ASD in humans thus suggesting the key role of the BET-controlled gene network in ASD. Our studies also suggest that environmental factors controlling BET proteins or their target genes may contribute to the epigenetic mechanism of ASD. There are 24 total samples.

These are believed to be the critical events that account for the induction of the adaptive immune response. Here, we have examined the role of micro-RNA-155 (miR-155) in DC function and the induction of immunity. Using a model where the transfer of self-antigen-pulsed, TLR-matured DCs can induce a functional CD8 T cell response and autoimmunity, we find that DCs lacking miR-155 have an impaired ability to break immune tolerance. Importantly, transfer of self- antigen-pulsed DCs overexpressing miR-155 was sufficient to break tolerance in the absence of TLR stimuli. Although these unstimulated DCs induced T cell function in vivo, there was no evidence for the upregulation of costimulatory ligands or cytokine secretion. Further analysis showed that miR-155 influenced the level of the phosphatase SHIP1 in DCs, and that the lack of SHIP1 in DCs was sufficient to break T cell tolerance in vivo, again in the absence of TLR induced DC maturation. Our study demonstrates that the overexpression of miR-155 in DCs is a critical event that is alone sufficient to break self tolerance and promote a CD8-mediated autoimmune response in vivo. This process is independent of the induction of conventional DC maturation markers, indicating that miR-155 regulation of SHIP represents a unique axis that regulates DC function in vivo. Dendritic cell culture: Bone marrow was flushed from tibias and femurs of mice with HBSS. Bone marrow cells were cultured at 2x106 cells/ml in 10 ml non-tissue culture treated dishes in RPMI 1640 containing 10% LPS-free FBS, Penicillin:streptomycin glutamine 2-mercaptoethanol (cRPMI), with 40ng/ml murine GM-CSF (Peprotech). On day 3 of cultures 10ml of fresh media was added also containing 40ng/ml GM-CSF. On days 6 and 8, 10ml of media was removed and centrifuged to collect cells, which were resuspended in 10ml fresh media containing GM-CSF and were added back to dishes. Non-adherent cells were isolated on day 9.

Here we show that in mouse models of BCR-ABL1 leukemia, Ikzf1 and Arf alterations synergistically promote the development of an aggressive lymphoid leukemia. Ikzf1 alterations were associated with acquisition of stem cell-like features, including self-renewal and increased bone marrow stromal adhesion. Rexinoid receptor agonists reversed this phenotype, in part by inducing expression of IKZF1, resulting in abrogation of adhesion and self-renewal, cell cycle arrest and attenuation of proliferation without direct cytotoxicity. Retinoids potentiated the activity of dasatinib in mouse and human BCR-ABL1 ALL, providing a new therapeutic option in IKZF1-mutated ALL. Significance: The outcome of therapy for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia remains suboptimal despite contemporary chemotherapy and the advent of targeted therapeutic approaches. Recent genomic studies have identified deletions or mutations of IKZF1 as a hallmark of high-risk ALL, but an understanding of how IKZF1 alteration contribute to leukemia development are lacking. Here we show that IKZF1 alterations drive lymphoid lineage, a stem cell-like phenotype, abnormal bone marrow adhesion, and poor responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Using a high-content screen, we show that retinoids reverse this phenotype in part by inducing expression of wild type IKZF1, and increase responsiveness to TKIs. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of high-risk ALL and potential new therapeutic approaches.

Although only 166 (0.59%) of the 27901 quantified transcripts in all samples were significantly up- and 88 (0.32%) down-regulated, the synergistic coupling of the heart contraction genes increased by 22% while their antagonistic coupling decreased by 43%.

They not only provide physical and nutritional support but also secrete factors essential to the complex developmental processes of germ cell proliferation and differentiation. The SC transcriptome must therefore adapt rapidly during the different stages of spermatogenesis. We report comprehensive genome-wide expression profiles of pure populations of SCs isolated at 5 distinct stages of the first wave of mouse spermatogenesis, using RNA sequencing technology. We were able to reconstruct about 13 901 high-confidence, nonredundant coding and noncoding transcripts, characterized by complex alternative splicing patterns with more than 45% comprising novel isoforms of known genes. Interestingly, roughly one-fifth (2939) of these genes exhibited a dynamic expression profile reflecting the evolving role of SCs during the progression of spermatogenesis, with stage-specific expression of genes involved in biological processes such as cell cycle regulation, metabolism and energy production, retinoic acid synthesis, and blood-testis barrier biogenesis. Finally, regulatory network analysis identified the transcription factors endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 (EPAS1/Hif2  ), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT/Hif1  ), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) as potential master regulators driving the SC transcriptional program.

To test the hypothesis that mutation of the APC gene alters microbial interactions with host intestinal mucosa prior to the development of polyposis, culture-independent methods (targeted qPCR assays and Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V1V2 hypervariable region) were used to compare the intestinal microbial composition of 30 six-week old C57BL/6 APCMin/+ and 30 congenic wild type (WT) mice.  The results demonstrate that similar to 12-14 week old APCMin/+ mice with intestinal neoplasia, 6 week old APCMin/+ mice with no detectable neoplasia, exhibit an increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes spp in the colon.  Parallel mouse RNA sequence analysis, conducted on a subset of proximal colonic RNA samples (6 APCMin/+, 6 WT) revealed 130 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, fold change     2, FDR <0.05). Hierarchical clustering of the DEGs was carried out by using 1-r dissimilarity measurement, where r stands for the Pearson correlation, and Ward minimum variance linkage, in order to reduce the number of input variables.  When the cluster centroids (medians) were included along with APC genotype as input variables, analysis of variance and covariance (ANCOVA) with stepwise variable selection, selected two of seven mouse gene clusters, in addition to APC genotype, as significantly associated (p = 0.011 and p = 0.004) with the increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes spp.  One of the two clusters includes several downregulated genes encoding immunoglobulin variable regions and non-protein coding RNAs.   These results support the concept that mutation of the APC gene alters colonic-microbial interactions prior to polyposis. It remains to be determined whether interventions directed at ameliorating dysbiosis in APCMin/+mice, such as through probiotics, prebiotics or antibiotics, could reduce tumor formation.

However, the RAG proteins bind widely to open chromatin, which suggests that additional mechanisms must restrict RAG-mediated DNA cleavage. Here we show that developmental downregulation of interleukin 7 (IL-7)-receptor signaling in small pre-B cells induced expression of the bromodomain-family member BRWD1, which was recruited to a specific epigenetic landscape at Igk dictated by pre   BCR-dependent Erk activation. BRWD1 enhanced RAG recruitment, increased gene accessibility and positioned nucleosomes 5    to each J   recombination signal sequence. BRWD1 thus targets recombination to Igk and places recombination within the context of signaling cascades that control B cell development. Our findings represent a paradigm in which,at any particular antigen-receptor locus, specialized mechanisms enforce lineage- and stage-specific recombination.

The role of tissue microenvironments in the pathogenesis of T-ALL or any other type of acute leukemia is little understood. In delineating interactions between T-ALL cells and their environment, we initially found that T-ALL cells express high surface levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Intravital imaging of an intact tibia revealed T-ALL cells in direct contact with bone marrow stromal cells producing the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12. Genetic targeting of CXCR4 on T-ALL cells resulted in a marked reduction of leukemia burden and prolonged disease remission, and disruption of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis using small molecule inhibitors prevented T-ALL progression in a primary xenograft model. Finally, we were able to show that CXCR4 inhibition significantly decreased expression of Myc and its target genes. Myc expression is a key regulator of T-ALL leukemia initiating cell (LIC) activity, suggesting that CXCR4 inhibition can suppress LIC activity by silencing the Myc response in T-ALL cells. Our data suggest that targeting of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling could be a powerful new tool for combating T-ALL, a disease with no current targeted therapies. Mouse T-ALL cells were treated ex vivo with Cxcr4 inhibitor AMD3100 or vehicle control. Additionally, mouse T-ALL primary tumors were isolated from control (Cxcr4+/+) or knockout (Cxcr4-/-) animals. Total RNA was extracted from samples using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). Samples were then subject to PolyA selection using oligo-dT beads (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting RNA samples were then used as input for library construction using the dUTP method as described by Parkhomchuck et al., 2009. RNA libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 using 50bp single-end reads. ..

Loss of Kdm5a rescues myogenic differentiation, as judged by appearance of morphologically normal myotubes that display expression of late markers of differentiation. In order to better understand how Kdm5a loss rescues differentiation, we induced mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of different genotypes to undergo myogenic differentiation and analyzed gene expression changes in wild-type, Kdm5a-/-, Rb1-/- and Kdm5a-/-; Rb1-/- cells. Rb1-/- cells stained single nucleated, did not exhibit morphological changes and increased expression of the myogenic marker MYHC. Except for Rb1-/- cells, all other cells were undergoing successful convertion into aligned multinucleated myotubes and were MYHC-positive.

Thus, a treatment reversing the Warburg effect could decrease tumor cell survival both in the presence or absence of chemotherapy. Short-term starvation (STS) could accomplish this task since it is accompanied by a glucose and amino acid decrease and fatty acid increase, which require respiration for energy production.   We tested the cytotoxicity of STS+Oxaliplatin on colon cancer cells by Trypan Blue,  Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl ester and  Annexin V staining. Reactive oxygen species production was measured by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining. In vitro glucose consumption was evaluated by 18F-Fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake. Gene expression was tested by microarray analysis.  Protein expression and activity were studied by western blot, proteomic analyses and spectrophotometric assays. CT26 bearing mice consumed only water for 48 hours (STS) before oxaliplatin treatment. Dynamic micro-Positron Emission Tomography and tumor growth measurements were performed. STS+Oxaliplatin cause a potent suppression of colon carcinoma growth and glucose consumption in in vitro and in vivo models. In CT26 cells, STS down-regulates aerobic glycolysis, and glutaminolysis, while increasing oxidative phosphorylation.  STS-dependent increase in  O2 consumption is associated with reduced ATP synthesis and increased oxidation. In combination with chemotherapy, these effects of STS cause additive toxicity to cancer cells. Our findings indicate that during and following STS the decreased glucose levels promote an anti-Warburg effect characterized by increased oxygen consumption but failure to generate ATP, resulting in oxidative damage and apoptosis.

Moreover, long-term drinking of H2-water (water infused with H2) enhanced energy expenditure to improve obesity and diabetes in db/db mice, accompanied with the increased gene expression of an energy metabolism stimulatory hepatic hormone, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21); however, the molecular mechanism is unknown particularly on whether this gene regulation is a primary cause or the secondary consequence.

We are investigating the role of VDR in epidermal stem cells and their progenies in the regeneration process of epidermis and hair in the skin. VDR null mice are utilized in which VDR is specifically deleted in keratin 14 (K14) expressing keratinocytes by Cre-lox strategy. The impact of VDR deletion was evaluated by comparison of VDR null mice with no cre littermate control mice. The VDR was abundantly expressed in potential epidermal stem cells including basal cells in interfollicular epidermis (IFE), and in CD34 expressing bulge keratinocytes in hair follicles. Gene expression profiles and subsequent pathway analysis of stem cell enriched keratinocyte populations revealed that the VDR deletion significantly suppressed   -catenin signaling as well as VDR signaling. The role of VDR in epidermal stem cells was studied during hair follicle cycling and wound healing processes. The epidermal stem cells were not appropriately stimulated by hair depilation, and did not reinitiate anagen in the hair follicles resulting in a failure of hair regrowth. In addition, the stem cells were not fully activated after full thickness wounds were generated in VDR null skin under a low calcium diet to suppress compensation pathways. Cell proliferation was not fully induced in potential stem cells located in both IFE and hair follicles near the wounding edges, and re-epithelialization rate was delayed in VDR null skin. Gene expression profiling of the wounded skin (3 days after injury) indicated that   -catenin signaling was not fully induced in VDR null skin comparable to that observed in   -catenin null mice.  The   -catenin target genes including Axin2 and cell cycle regulators involved in epidermal stem cell function were not induced in the edges of the wound of VDR null skin. These results demonstrated that VDR plays an essential role in hair cycling and wound healing processes through regulation of   -catenin signaling in epidermal stem cells and their progenies. n=3 CON and KO (each sample contain RNA isolated from wounded skins excised from 3 mice) .. 3 months;  b-catenin fl/fl;  b-catenin fl/fl Cre K14 driven;  total RNA;  skin;  C57BL6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  skin;  b-catenin KO mice and their littermate control mice received two full-thickness wounds with a 6-mm biopsy punch on the back skin at 3 month of age.

We developed a clinically-relevant mouse model of lethal polymicrobial gut-derived sepsis in mice using a 4-member pathogen community (Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus faecalis) isolated from a critically ill patient. In order to mimic pre-operative surgical patient condition mice were exposed to food restriction and antibiotics. Approximately 18 hours prior to surgery food was removed from the cages and the mice were allowed only tap water. Each mouse received an intramuscular Cefoxitin injection 30 minutes prior to the incision at a concentration of 25 mg/kg into the left thigh. Mice were then subjected to a midline laparotomy, 30% hepatectomy of the left lateral lobe of the liver and a direct cecal inoculation of 200   L of the four pathogen community.

We previously reported that immunosuppressive cells can be generated in vitro from bone marrow cells (BM) after four days GM-CSF and IL-6 treatment. Here, we describe that miR-142-3p down-regulation directs macrophage differentiation and determines the acquisition of their immunosuppressive function in cancer. Enforced miR over-expression impaired monocyte to macrophage transition both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, forced miR down-regulation promoted the generation of immunosuppressive macrophages even during G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation. To identify how miR-142-3p regulates MDSC generation and activity, we analyze the gene expression of BM cultures transfected  with either CTRL- or miR 142-3p mimic oligo -transfected before  four days GM-CSF and IL-6 treatment.

Loss of Tbx3 induces differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, we show that mESCs exist in an alternate stable pluripotent state in the absence of Tbx3. In-depth transcriptome analysis of this mESC state reveals Dppa3 as a direct downstream target of Tbx3. Also Tbx3 facilitates the cell fate transition from pluripotent cells to mesoderm progenitors by directly repressing Wnt pathway members required for differentiation. Wnt signaling regulates differentiation of mESCs into mesoderm progenitors and helps maintain a na  ve pluripotent state. We show that Tbx3, a downstream target of Wnt signaling, fine-tunes these divergent roles of Wnt signaling in mESCs. In conclusion, we identify a signaling-TF axis that controls the exit of mESCs from a self-renewing pluripotent state towards mesoderm differentiation.

Physiological responses to CR are cell-type specific and variable throughout the lifespan; however, the mosaic of molecular changes responsible CR benefits remain unclear, particularly in brain regions susceptible to deterioration throughout aging. Thus, we examined the influence of long-term CR on the CA1 hippocampal region, a key learning and memory brain area that is vulnerable to age-related pathologies, such as Alzheimer   s disease (AD). Through mRNA sequencing and NanoString nCounter analysis, we demonstrate that one year of CR feeding suppresses an age-dependent signature of 882 genes functionally associated with synaptic transmission-related pathways, including calcium signaling, long-term potentiation (LTP), and Creb signaling in wild-type mice. By comparing the influence of CR on hippocampal CA1 region transcriptional profiles at younger- (5 months) and older-adult (15 months) timepoints, we identify conserved upregulation of proteome quality control and calcium buffering genes, including heat shock 70 kDa proteins 1b and 5 (Hspa1b and Hspa5), protein disulfide isomerase family A members 4 and 6 (Pdia4 and Pdia6), and calreticulin (Calr). Expression levels of putative neuroprotective factors, klotho (Kl) and transthyretin (Ttr), are also elevated by CR throughout adulthood, although the global CR-specific expression profiles at young and older timepoints are highly divergent. At a previously unachieved resolution, our results demonstrate conserved activation of neuroprotective gene signatures and broad CR-suppression of age-dependent hippocampal CA1 region expression changes, indicating that CR functionally maintains a more youthful transcriptional state within hippocampal CA1 throughout aging. Hippocampal CA1 region mRNA profiles of younger- (5 months) and older-adult (15 months) mice on calorie-restricted (CR) and normal (AD) diets were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500. .. 15 months;  5 months;  calorie-restricted;  normal;  total RNA;  hippocampal CA1 region;  10090;  Mus musculus;  hippocampal CA1 region;

The genes that Myt3 regulates and its role in islet-cell development, function and survival are not fully known. The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in gene expression following the suppression or over-expression of Myt3 to identify possible pathways that may be regulated by Myt3. Methods: Pancreatic islets were isolated from both male and female C57/B6 mice by collagenase digestion and were picked by hand. Hand-picked islets were plated onto 804G, a complete extracellular-matrix (ECM) produced by a rat bladder carcinoma cell line, treated tissue culture dishes and transduced with 1x106 pfu virus overnight. The next  day media was changed to fresh RPMI and islets were cultured for 7 days. At the end of the culture period islets were dispersed and FACs sorted for GFP+ cells. Sorted cells from at least 5 experiments were pooled and RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent. 800ng of RNA was used in the Illumina TruSeq kit for library preparation. Results: Comparison of gene expression levels between control-transduced islets and either shMyt3- or Myt3-transduced islets resulted in the identification of 51 and 89 significantly altered genes respectively. Conclusions: Our study represents the first comprehensive analysis of genes that are potentially regulated by Myt3 and highlight potential pathways that are likely important for mediating Myt3's effects of islet development, function and survival.

These transcripts persist within the male gamete despite the dramatic reduction in cellular volume achieved through expulsion of the cytoplasm and quite possibly the nucleoplasm. The precise location of RNAs retained within the sperm cell remains largely unknown. However, early evidence suggested that many are embedded within the nucleus (1). To discern the global pattern of transcript compartmentalization in sperm, total RNA was extracted from whole mouse spermatozoa and detergent demembranated nuclei fractionated through a sucrose gradient. Isolated RNAs were subjected to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and their abundance used to infer localization. Transcripts enriched in the unfractionated cells were related to the production and function of mitochondria and surprisingly, exosomes. The absence of these extracellular vesicles associated RNAs within the inner-nuclear compartment was suggestive of an origin other than sperm. This contributes to the growing evidence for sperm-bound exosomes rich in RNA. In comparison, the majority of the remaining sperm RNAs were associated with the nucleus. This included the abundant fragmented ribosomal transcripts which likely persist between the nuclear envelope and the perinuclear theca. The spermatozoal inner-nuclear compartment was also enriched in repetitive transcribed sequences. This included LINE elements and simple repeat sequences both of which have been shown to contribute to chromatin structure in other cell types suggesting that they may serve parallel roles in the spermatozoon.

Here we show that IL-21 unexpectedly induces IL-1   production in conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) via a STAT3-dependent but NF-  B-independent pathway. IL-21 does not induce Il1b expression in CD4+ T cells, with differential histone marks present in these cells versus cDCs.  IL-21-induced IL-1   processing in cDCs does not require caspase-1 or caspase-8 but depends on IL-21-mediated death and activation of serine protease(s).

Animal models of genetically diverse mouse strains are well suitable to identify host genes involved in severe pathology, viral replication and immune responses. Here, we have utilizing a dual RNAseq approach that allowed us to investigate both viral and host gene expression in the same individual from a single expression assay after H1N1 infection. We performed a comparative expression analysis to identify (i) correlations between host genes and the viral gene expression, (ii) host genes involved in viral replication, and (iii) genes showing differential expression between the two mouse strains after infection. These genes may be key players involved in regulating the differences in pathogenesis and host defense mechanisms after influenza A infections. Expression levels of influenza segments correlated well with the viral load and may thus be used as surrogates for conventional viral load measurements. Furthermore, we investigated the functional role of two genes, Reg3g and Irf7, in knock-out mice and found that deletion of the Irf7 gene renders the host highly susceptible to H1N1 infection.

In particular, we demonstrate that eIF4E dose is essential for translating mRNAs regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that fuel transformation and cancer cell survival in vivo. Therefore, mammalian cells have evolved surplus eIF4E levels that cancer cells hijack to drive a translational program supporting tumorigenesis Total cellular RNA and high MW polysome associated RNA were isolated from matched untransformed and tranformed WT and Eif4e+/- MEFs for analysis on Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays.

Although IL-21 can activate several STAT family transcription factors, previous studies focused mainly on the role of STAT3 in IL-21 signaling. Here, we investigated the role of STAT1 and show that STAT1 and STAT3 have at least partially opposing roles in IL-21 signaling in CD4+ T cells. IL-21 induced STAT1 phosphorylation, and this was augmented in Stat3-deficient CD4+ T cells. RNA-Seq analysis of CD4+ T cells from Stat1- and Stat3-deficient mice revealed that both STAT1 and STAT3 are critical for IL-21-mediated gene regulation. Expression of some genes, including Tbx21 and Ifng, was differentially regulated by STAT1 and STAT3, and interestingly, ChIP-Seq analysis showed that STAT3 binding at Tbx21 and Ifng loci was attenuated in Stat1-deficient cells. Moreover, opposing actions of STAT1 and STAT3 on IFN-    expression in CD4+ T cells were demonstrated in vivo during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) infection. Finally, IL-21-mediated induction of STAT1 phosphorylation, as well as IFNG and TBX21 expression, were higher in CD4+ T cells from patients with autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), which is caused by STAT3 deficiency. These data indicate an interplay between STAT1 and STAT3 in fine-tuning IL-21 actions.

Current m6A mapping approaches rely on immunoprecipitation of m6A-containing RNA fragments to identify regions of transcripts that contain m6A.  This approach localizes m6A residues to 100-200 nt-long regions of transcripts.  The precise position of m6A in mRNAs cannot be identified on a transcriptome-wide level because there are no chemical methods to distinguish between m6A and adenosine.  Here we show that anti-m6A antibodies can induce specific mutational signatures at m6A residues after ultraviolet light-induced antibody-RNA crosslinking and reverse transcription.  Similarly, we find these antibodies induce mutational signatures at N6, 2   -O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), a nucleotide found at the first encoded position of certain mRNAs.  Using these mutational signatures, we map m6A and m6Am at single-nucleotide resolution in human and mouse mRNA and identify snoRNAs as a novel class of m6A-containing ncRNAs. UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation with m6A-specific antibodies was used to map m6A and m6Am in cellular RNA with single nucleotide resolution. ..

Treg cells are characterized by a distinct pattern of gene expression, including upregulation of immune-suppressive genes and silencing of inflammatory cytokine genes. However, the molecular mechanisms that establish and/or maintain such gene regulation in Treg cells remain largely unknown. We recently reported that Nr4a family nuclear orphan receptors are essential for the development of Treg cells. The fact that Treg cells maintain high levels of expression of all Nr4a family components suggests that they may also play critical roles beyond Treg cell development. Thus, we compared mRNA expression pattern between wild-type Treg cells and Nr4a-deficietn Treg cells. As a result, we found that expression of 'Treg-signature genes' were globally down regulated in Nr4a-deficient Treg cells. mRNA from wild-type and Nr4a-deficient Treg cells were analyzed. .. 5 week old;  regulatory T cells;  Nr4a-deficient;  wild type;  total RNA;  Nr4a-deficient Treg cells;  Wild-type Treg cells;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Treg cells from wild-type or Nr4a-TKO mice were sorted, and directly lysed with RNA-iso total RNA extraction solution (Takara, Japan).;

Although p53-dependent regulation of Wnt signalling activity is known to occur, the importance of these regulatory mechanisms during the early stages of intestinal neoplasia has not been demonstrated. METHODS: We have conditionally deleted the Adenomatous Polyposis coli gene (Apc) from the adult murine intestine in wild type and p53 deficient environments and subsequently compared the phenotype and transcriptome profiles in both genotypes. RESULTS: Expression of p53 was shown to be elevated following the conditional deletion of Apc in the adult small intestine. Furthermore, p53 status was shown to impact on the transcription profile observed following Apc loss. A number of key Wnt pathway components and targets were altered in the p53 deficient environment. However, the aberrant phenotype observed following loss of Apc (rapid nuclear localisation of beta-catenin, increased levels of DNA damage, nuclear atypia, perturbed cell death, proliferation, differentiation and migration) was not significantly altered by the absence of p53. CONCLUSION: p53 related feedback mechanisms regulating Wnt signalling activity are present in the intestine, and become activated following loss of Apc. However, the physiological Wnt pathway regulation by p53 appears to be overwhelmed by Apc loss and consequently the activity of these regulatory mechanisms is not sufficient to modulate the immediate phenotypes seen following Apc loss. Thus we are able to provide an explanation to the apparent contradiction that, despite having a Wnt regulatory capacity, p53 loss is not associated with early lesion development. Samples were collected from genetically modified mice. Gene recombination was induced using IP administration of beta-napthoflavone. ..

We have identified cytokine, signaling and transcription factors that are required for cachexia in the mouse C26 colon carcinoma model of cancer. C2C12 myotubes treated with conditioned medium from C26 cancer cells induced atrophy and activated a STAT-dependent reporter gene but not reporter genes dependent on SMAD, FOXO, C/EBP, NF-  B, or AP-1. Of the gp130 family members IL-11, IL-6, oncostatin M (OSM), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), only OSM and LIF were sufficient to activate the STAT reporter in myotubes. A LIF blocking antibody abolished C26 CM-induced STAT reporter activation STAT3 phosphorylation and myotube atrophy, but blocking antibodies to IL-6 or OSM did not. JAK2 inhibitors also blocked the C26 CM-induced STAT reporter activation, STAT3 phosphorylation, and atrophy in myotubes. LIF at levels found in the C26 CM was sufficient for STAT reporter activation and atrophy in myotubes. In vivo, an increase in serum LIF preceded the increase in IL-6 in mice with C26 tumors. Overexpression of a dominant negative Stat3C  -EGFP gene in myotubes and in mouse muscle blocked the atrophy caused by C26 CM or C26 tumors, respectively. Taken together these data support an important role of LIF- JAK2-STAT3 in C26 cachexia and point to a therapeutic approach for at least some types of cancer cachexia. from three replicate wells of cells at each treatment, pools of total RNA were used to create cDNA which were evaluated on Affymetrix mouse gene 1.0 ST v.1 arrays. .. 1/3 volume C26 conditioned medium in differentiation medium;  LIF;  control;  total RNA;  C2 myotubes 24 hours C26 CM treatment;  C2 myotubes 24 hours LIF treatment;  C2 myotubes 24 hours no treatment;  C2 myotubes 4 hours C26 CM treatment;  C2 myotubes 4 hours LIF treatment;  C2 myotubes 4 hours no treatment;  C2 myotubes 8 hours C26 CM treatment;  C2 myotubes 8 hours LIF treatment;  C2 myotubes 8 hours no treatment;  10090;  Mus musculus;  24 hrs;  4 hrs;  8 hrs;  cultured C2 myotubes;  __untreated;  __untreated;

In order to better understand the response to 90Sr, using an easily attainable and standard biodosimetry sample fluid, we analyzed the global transcriptomic response of blood cells in an in vivo model system.  Methods We injected C57BL/6 mice with a solution of 90SrCl2 and followed them over a 30-day period. At days 4, 7, 9, 25 and 30, we collected blood and isolated RNA for microarray analyses. These days corresponded to target doses in a range from 1 to 5 Gy. We investigated changes in mRNA levels using microarrays, and changes in specific microRNA (miRNA) predicted to be involved in the response using qRT-PCR.  Results We identified 8082 differentially expressed genes in the blood of mice exposed to 90Sr compared with controls. Common biological functions were affected throughout the study, including apoptosis of B and T lymphocytes, and atrophy of lymphoid organs. Cellular functions such as RNA degradation and lipid metabolism were also affected during the study. The broad down regulation of genes observed in our study suggested a potential role for miRNA in gene regulation. We tested candidate miRNAs, mmu-miR-16, mmu-miR-124, mmu-miR-125 and mmu-mir-21; and found that all were induced at the earliest time point, day 4. Conclusions Our study is the first to report the transcriptomic response of blood cells to the internal emitter 90Sr in mouse and a possible role for microRNA in gene regulation after 90Sr exposure. The most dramatic effect was observed on gene expression related to B-cell development and RNA maintenance. These functions were affected by genes that were down regulated throughout the study, suggesting severely compromised antigen response, which may be a result of the deposition of the radioisotope proximal to the hematopoietic compartment in bone.

Recently, we reported that a specific histone modification signature is strongly associated with MAE, and demonstrated that it can serve as a proxy of MAE in human lymphoblastoid cells (Nag et al. Elife. 2013 Dec 31;2:e01256). Here, we use murine cells to establish that this chromatin signature is conserved between mouse and human, and is associated with MAE in every tested cell type. Our analyses reveal extensive conservation in the identity of MAE genes between the two species. By applying MAE chromatin signature analysis to a large number of cell and tissue types, we show that the MAE state remains consistent during terminal cell differentiation and is predominant among cell-type specific genes, suggesting a link between MAE and specification of cell identity.

We use mouse female Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) with nonrandom XCI and polymorphic X chromosomes to study the dynamics of gene silencing over the inactive X chromosome (Xi) by high-resolution allele-specific RNA-Seq. Results: Induction of XCI by differentiation of female ESCs shows that genes proximal to the X-inactivation center (XIC) are silenced earlier than distal genes, while lowly expressed genes show faster XCI dynamics than highly expressed genes. The active X chromosome shows a minor but significant increase in gene activity during differentiation, resulting in complete dosage compensation in differentiated cell types. Genes escaping XCI show little or no silencing during early propagation of XCI. Using allele-specific RNA-Seq of Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs) generated from the female ESCs, we identify three regions distal to the XIC that stably escape XCI during differentiation of the female ESCs, as well as during propagation of the NPCs. These regions coincide with Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) as determined in the undifferentiated female ESCs. Also the previously characterized human gene clusters escaping XCI correlate with TADs. Conclusions: Together, the dynamics of gene silencing observed over the Xi during XCI provide further insight in the formation and maintenance of the repressive Xi complex. The association of regions of escape with TADs, in mouse and human, suggests a regulatory role for TADs during propagation of XCI. 19 RNA-Seq profiles of mouse ESCs, EpiSCs and NPCs, mostly from distant crosses to allow allele specific mapping. 1 HiC profile of an undifferentiated mouse female ESC line containing a Tsix mutation.

To evaluate the degree of specificity and redundancy for these cytokines, we quantified global transcriptomic changes induced by the two cytokines and determined the relative contributions of STAT1 and STAT3 using genetic models and ChIP-seq. We found a high degree of overlap of the transcriptomes induced by IL-6 and IL-27 and extremely few examples in which the cytokines acted in opposition. Using STAT deficient cells and T cells from patients with gain-of-function STAT1 mutations, we show that STAT3 was responsible for the overall transcriptional output driven by both cytokines, whereas STAT1 was the driver of cytokine specificity. STAT1 did not compensate for the lack STAT3; on the contrary, much of STAT1 binding to chromatin was STAT3 dependent.

During embryogenesis, Sox4 regulates the survival of mesenchymal and neural progenitors, lymphocyte and myeloid differentiation, and pancreatic, bone and cardiac development. Aberrantly increased Sox4 expression is linked to malignant transformation and metastasis in several types of human cancer. To study the role of Sox4 in the adult organism, we first generated mice with reduced whole-body Sox4 expression. These mice display a plethora of age-related degenerative disorders and reduced spontaneous cancer incidence, indicating a role for this protein in maintaining adult tissue homeostasis and in tumor growth. To specifically address a role for Sox4 in adult stem cells, we conditionally deleted Sox4 (Sox4cKO) in stratified epithelia. Sox4cKO mice show increased skin stem cell quiescence and DNA damage accumulation, accompanied by resistance to chemical carcinogenesis. These phenotypes correlate with downregulation of cell cycle, DNA repair and skin stem cell genes in the absence of Sox4. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of Sox4 in adult tissue homeostasis and cancer.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms driving the homeostasis and differentiation of this cell pool. In this work, we conducted Affymetrix gene chip experiments to identify differences in gene regulation between proliferation and early differentiation of enteric neural progenitors. We detected a total of 1333 regulated genes that were linked to different groups of cellular mechanisms involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, neural proliferation, and differentiation. As expected, we found a strong inhibition of cell cycle progression as well as an enhanced expression of neuronal and glial markers. We further found a marked inactivation of the canonical Wnt pathway during the beginning of cellular differentiation. Taken together, this data illustrated the various mechanisms taking place during the proliferation and early differentiation of enteric neural progenitor cells.

Here we demonstrate that disruption of TADs can cause rewiring of long-range regulatory architecture and result in pathogenic phenotypes. We show that distinct human limb malformations are caused by deletions, inversions, or duplications altering the structure of the TAD-spanning WNT6/IHH/EPHA4/PAX3 locus. Using CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we generated mice with corresponding rearrangements. Both in mouse limb tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts, disease-relevant structural changes cause ectopic interactions between promoters and non-coding DNA, and a cluster of limb enhancers normally associated with Epha4 is misplaced relative to TAD boundaries and drives ectopic limb expression of another gene in the locus. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome.

Using a new mouse model of the disease and a large cohort of human CPCs [GSE60892; GSE60899], we performed a cross-species, genome-wide search for novel oncogenes within syntenic regions of chromosome gain.  TAF12, NFYC and RAD54L, co-located on human chromosome 1p32-35.3 and mouse chromosome 4qD1-D3, were identified as oncogenes that are gained in tumors in both species and required to initiate and progress the disease in mice.  TAF12 and NFYC are transcription factors that regulate the epigenome, while RAD54L plays a central role in DNA repair.

The Th17 lineage of T helper (Th) cells can cause severe human inflammatory diseases.  These cells exhibit both instability (i.e., they can cease to express their signature cytokine, IL-17A) and plasticity (i.e., they can start expressing cytokines typical of other lineages) upon in vitro re-stimulation. However technical limitations prevented the transcriptional profiling of pre- and post-conversion Th17 cells ex vivo during immune responses. Thus, it is unknown whether Th17 cell plasticity merely reflects change in  expression of a few cytokines, or if Th17 cells physiologically undergo global genetic reprogramming driving their conversion from one T helper cell type to another, a process known as    transdifferentiation   . Furthermore, while Th17 cell instability/plasticity has been associated with pathogenicity, it is unknown whether this could present a therapeutic opportunity, whereby formerly pathogenic Th17 cells could adopt an anti-inflammatory fate.  Here we used two novel fate-mapping mouse models to track Th17 cells during immune responses to show that CD4+ T cells that formerly expressed IL-17A go on to acquire an anti-inflammatory phenotype. The transdifferentiation of Th17 into regulatory T cells was illustrated by a global change in their transcriptome and the acquisition of potent regulatory capacity. Comparisons of the transcriptional profiles of pre- and post-conversion Th17 cells also revealed a role for canonical TGF-    signaling and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in conversion. Thus, Th17 transdifferentiate into regulatory cells, and contribute to the resolution of inflammation. Our data suggest Th17 cell instability and plasticity is a therapeutic opportunity for inflammatory diseases. We isolated intestinal lymphocytes from two independent experiments, each using 5 mice injected with anti-CD3 mAb. Th17, exTh17, Tr1 exTh17, Tr1, Foxp3 Treg and Foxp3 IL-10+ Treg cell populations were FACS-sorted from these two independent experiments and the cells of each population were pooled before the analysis.

The accumulation of mitochondria harboring mtDNA mutations in patients with these disorders suggests a failure of normal mitochondrial quality-control systems. The mtDNA-mutator mice acquire somatic mtDNA mutations via a targeted defect in the proofreading function of the mtDNA polymerase, PolgA, and develop macrocytic anemia similar to that of patients with MDS. We observed an unexpected defect in clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria at specific stages during erythroid maturation in hematopoietic cells from aged mtDNA-mutator mice. Mechanistically, aberrant activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling and phosphorylation of uncoordinated 51-like kinase (ULK) 1 in mtDNA-mutator mice resulted in proteasome mediated degradation of ULK1 and inhibition of autophagy in erythroid cells. To directly evaluate the consequence of inhibiting autophagy on mitochondrial function in erythroid cells harboring mtDNA mutations in vivo, we deleted Atg7 from erythroid progenitors of wildtype and mtDNA-mutator mice. Genetic disruption of autophagy did not cause anemia in wild-type mice but accelerated the decline in mitochondrial respiration and development of macrocytic anemia in mtDNA-mutator mice. These findings highlight a pathological feedback loop that explains how dysfunctional mitochondria can escape autophagy-mediated degradation and propagate in cells predisposed to somatic mtDNA mutations, leading to disease.

Pluripotent-specific transcriptional networks are sequentially reactivated as somatic cells reprogram to achieve pluripotency. How epigenetic regulators modulate this process and contribute to somatic cell reprogramming is not clear. Here we perform a functional RNAi screen to identify the earliest epigenetic regulators required for reprogramming. We identify components of the SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex, in particular Gcn5, as critical regulators of reprogramming initiation. Furthermore, we show in mouse pluripotent stem cells that Gcn5 strongly associates with Myc and that upon initiation of somatic reprogramming, Gcn5 and Myc form a positive feed forward loop that activates a distinct alternative splicing network and the early acquisition of pluripotency-associated splicing events. These studies expose a Myc-SAGA pathway that drives expression of an essential alternative splicing regulatory network during somatic cell reprogramming.

Recent studies suggest that this function also involves piRNA-guided cleavage of transposon-derived transcripts. As many piRNAs also appear to have the capacity to target diverse mRNAs, this raises the intriguing possibility that piRNAs may act extensively as siRNAs to degrade specific mRNAs. To directly test this hypothesis, we compared mouse PIWI (MIWI)-associated piRNAs with experimentally identified cleaved mRNA fragments from mouse testes, and observed cleavage sites that predominantly occur at position 10 from the 5' end of putative targeting piRNAs. We also noted strong biases for U and A residues at nucleotide positions 1 and 10, respectively, in both piRNAs and mRNA fragments, features that resemble the pattern of piRNA amplification by the 'ping-pong' cycle. Through mapping of MIWI-RNA interactions by CLIP-seq and gene expression profiling, we found that many potential piRNA-targeted mRNAs directly interact with MIWI and show elevated expression levels in the testes of Miwi catalytic mutant mice. Reporter-based assays further revealed the importance of base pairing between piRNAs and mRNA targets and the requirement for both the slicer activity and piRNA-loading ability of MIWI in piRNA-mediated target repression. Importantly, we demonstrated that proper turnover of certain key piRNA targets is essential for sperm formation. Together, these findings reveal the siRNA-like function of the piRNA machinery in mouse testes and its central requirement for male germ cell development and maturation.

In the thymus, PU.1 is expressed only in the early ETP/DN1, DN2a and DN2b stages of development. While PU.1 deletion in multipotent precursors leads to a complete block in T-cell development its function in the intrathymic stages in which it is expressed remains undetermined. The goal of this expression profiling study was to determine if PU.1 regulates the expression of T-lineage genes during the early stages of development. To do this, we generated the PU.1-Eng construct which expresses a fusion protein containing the DNA binding ETS domain of PU.1 (aas 159-260) fused to the obligate repressor domain (aas 1-298) of the Drosophila engrailed protein. The PU.1-ETS construct only expresses the ETS domain of PU.1 (aas 159-260) and serves as a control. Fetal liver precursors were isolated from e14.5 embryos and co-cultured with OP9-DL1 cells in the presence of IL-7 and Flt3L (5 ng/ml each) for 4 days to obtain FLDN1, DN2a and DN2b cells. These were infected with vector only, PU.1-ETS and the PU.1-Eng constructs and DN2 cells were sorted after 20 hours of infection. Total RNA was isolated from these cells and polyA+ fraction was used to prepare libraries for high throughput sequencing.

In the E11.5 embryo trunk, we previously estimated that Prep1 binds about 3,300 genomic sites at a highly specific decameric consensus sequence, mainly governing basal cellular functions. We now show that in embryonic stem (ES) cells Prep1 binding pattern only partly overlaps that of the embryo trunk, with about 2,000 novel sites, highlighting a change of targets between embryonic differentiated v. embryonic stem cells. RNA-seq identifies about 1800 genes down-regulated in Prep1- /- ES cells which belong to gene ontology categories not enriched in the E11.5 Prep1i/i differentiated embryo, including in particular the Wnt and Fgf pathways. Indeed, we find aberrant Wnt and Fgf expression levels in the Prep1-/- ES cells which agrees with a deficient embryoid bodies (EBs) differentiation.

How core cleavage and polyadenylation (C/P) factors regulate APA is not well understood. Using siRNA knockdown coupled with deep sequencing, we found that several C/P factors can play significant roles in 3   UTR-APA. Whereas Pcf11 and Fip1 enhance usage of proximal poly(A) sites (pAs), CFI-25/68, PABPN1, and PABPC1 promote usage of distal pAs. Strong cis element biases were found for pAs regulated by CFI or Fip1, and the distance between pAs plays an important role in APA regulation. In addition, intronic pAs are substantially regulated by splicing factors, with U1 mostly influencing C/P events in 5    introns and U2 impacting those in efficiently spliced introns. Furthermore, PABPN1 regulates expression of transcripts with pAs near the transcription start site, a property possibly related to its role in RNA degradation. Finally, we found that groups of APA events regulated by C/P factors are also modulated in cell differentiation and development with distinct trends. Together, our results indicate that the abundance of different C/P factors and splicing factors plays diverse roles in APA, and is relevant to APA regulation in biological conditions. knockdown experiments of 23 C/P factors, 3 splicing factors and U1D in mouse C2C12 myoblast cells ..

Reprogramming by transcription factors is a less efficient and slower process than that by other methods. Identification of a gene set capable of driving rapid and proper reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is an important issue. Here, we show that the efficiency and kinetics of iPSC reprogramming are dramatically improved by combined transduction of Jarid2, a gene highly expressed in both ESCs and oocytes and genes encoding its associated proteins. We demonstrate that forced expression of Jarid2 promotes iPSC reprogramming by suppressing the expression of Arf, a known reprogramming barrier, and that the N-terminal half of JARID2 is sufficient for such promotion. Moreover, Jarid2 accelerated retroviral transgene silencing and Nanog promoter demethylation, confirming its promoting activity. We further reveal that JARID2 physically interacts with ESRRB, SALL4A and PRDM14, and show that these JARID2-associated proteins synergistically and robustly facilitate iPSC reprogramming in a Jarid2-dependent manner. Our findings provide an insight into the important roles of Jarid2 during reprogramming, and suggest that the JARID2-associated protein network contributes to overcoming reprogramming barriers. We used microarrays to detect the up- and down-regulated genes in MEFs transduced with Jarid2 compared to empty vector control. Total RNA was extracted from mouse embrionc fibroblasts (MEFs) transduced with empty vector (control) or the indicated genes at 3 days post-transduction, and two iPSC clones from MEFs transduced with OSKM plus Jarid2.

Using a genome-wide approach in wild-type and methylation-deficient embryonic stem cells, we found that DNA methylation can act both as an enhancer and as a silencer of splicing, and affects the splicing of more than 20% of alternative exons. These exons are characterized by distinct genetic and epigenetic signatures. Alternative splicing regulation of a subset of these exons can be explained by Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which silences or enhances exon recognition in a position-dependent manner. We constructed an experimental system using site-specific targeting of a methylated/unmethylated gene, and demonstrate a direct causal relationship between DNA methylation and alternative splicing. HP1 regulates this gene   s alternative splicing in a methylation-dependent manner by recruiting splicing factors to its methylated form. Our results demonstrate DNA methylation's significant global influence on mRNA splicing, and identify a specific mechanism of splicing regulation mediated by HP1.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a dysregulated response to alveolar injury which causes  a progressive decline in lung function and refractory to current pharmacological therapies.  Airway and alveolar epithelial cells and stromal cells contribute to pulmonary fibrosis but the cell-specific pathways and gene networks that are responsible for the pathophysiology are unknown. Recent animals models generated in our lab demonstrate clinical phenotypes seen in human fibrotic disease. The mouse model of transforming growth factor-   (TGF  )-induced fibrosis include conditionally expressing TGF   in the lung epithelium under control of the CCSP promoter driving rtTA expression (CCSP/TGF  ).  This allow the TGF   is only expressed in airway and alveolar epithelial cells and only when mice fed doxycycline (Dox).  Similar to PF in humans, TGF   mice on Dox developed a progressive and extensive adventitial, interstitial and pleural fibrosis with a decline in lung mechanics. Thus, the TGF   transgenic mouse is a powerful model to determine lung cell-specific molecular signatures involved in pulmonary fibrosis.  In this study, we sought to determine changes in the transcriptome during  TGF  -induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our results showed that several pro-fibrotic genes increased in the lungs of TGF   mice. This study demonstrates that WT1 network gene changes associated with fibrosis and myfibroblast accumulation and thus may serve as a critical regulator fibrotic lung disease. mRNA profiles of CCSP/- and CCSP/TGFalpha mice treated with Dox ..

However, it remains unknown as to how E- and Id-proteins mechanistically enforce and maintain the na  ve T cell fate. Here we show that Id2 and Id3 suppressed the development and expansion of innate-variant TFH cells. Innate-variant TFH cells required MHC Class I-like signalling and were associated with germinal center B cell development. We found that Id2 and Id3 induced Foxo1 and Foxp1 expression to antagonize the activation of TFH transcription signature.  We show that Id2 and Id3 acted upstream of the Hif1a/Foxo/AKT/mTORC1 pathway as well as the c-myc/p19Arf module to control cellular expansion and activation. We found that mice depleted for Id2 and Id3 expression developed colitis and      T cell lymphomas. Lymphomas depleted for Id2 and Id3 expression displayed elevated levels of c-myc whereas p19Arf abundance declined. Transcription signatures of Id2- and Id3-depleted lymphomas revealed similarities with genetic deficiencies associated with Burkitt lymphoma. We propose that in response to antigen receptor and/or cytokine signaling the E-Id protein axis modulates the activities of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-Hifa and c-myc/p19Arf pathways to control cellular expansion and homeostatic proliferation.

In rodents alone, there is a huge divergence in the toxicological response across species, as well as among different strains within a species. But there are also significant differences between males and females animals of a single strain. These differences are inconsistent across model systems: the severity of toxicity is greater in female rats than males, while male mice and guinea pigs are more sensitive than females. Because the specific events that underlie this difference remain unclear, we characterized the hepatic transcriptional response of adult male and female C57BL/6 mice to 500  g/kg TCDD at multiple time-points. The transcriptional profile diverged significantly between the sexes. Female mice demonstrated a large number of altered transcripts as early as 6h following treatment, suggesting a large primary response. Conversely, male animals showed the greatest TCDD-mediated response 144h following exposure, potentially implicating significant secondary responses. Nr1i3 was statistically significantly induced at all time-points in the sensitive male animals. This mRNA encodes the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a transcription factor involved in the regulation of xenobiotic metabolism, lipid metabolism, cell cycle and apoptosis. Surprisingly though, changes at the protein level (aside from the positive control, CYP1A1) were modest, with only FMO3 showing clear induction, and no genes with sex-differences. Thus, while male and female mice show transcriptional differences in their response to TCDD, their association with TCDD-induced toxicities remains unclear. Adult male and female C57BL/6 mice were treated by gavage with either 500 ug/kg TCDD in corn oil or corn oil vehicle alone. Animals were euthanized at either 6, 24, 72 or 144 hours after treatment and tissues were harvested. RNA was isolated from hepatic tissue and the transcriptome for each animal assayed on an individual microarray.Please note that 7 samples (out of total 65 samples) were identified as outliers and therefore the data were processed without the outliers as well.

To identify key compensatory molecular mechanisms in response to chronic mitochondrial distress, we analyzed mice with ectopic SM respiratory uncoupling in uncoupling protein 1 transgenic (UCP1-TG) mice as model of muscle-specific compromised mitochondrial function. Here we describe a detailed metabolic reprogramming profile associated with mitochondrial perturbations in SM, triggering an increased protein turnover and amino acid metabolism with induced biosynthetic serine/1-carbon/glycine pathway and the longevity-promoting polyamine spermidine as well as the trans-sulfuration pathway. This is related to an induction of NADPH-generating pathways and glutathione metabolism as an adaptive mitohormetic response and defense against increased oxidative stress. Strikingly, consistent muscle retrograde signaling profiles were observed in acute stress states such as muscle cell starvation and lipid overload, muscle regeneration, and heart muscle inflammation, but not in response to exercise. We provide conclusive evidence for a key compensatory stress-signaling network that preserves cellular function, oxidative stress tolerance, and survival during conditions of increased SM mitochondrial distress, a metabolic reprogramming profile so far only demonstrated for cancer cells and heart muscle.-Ost, M., Keipert, S., van Schothorst, E.

Here we show that NFAT, a transcription factor with an established role in T cell activation, in parallel controls a second transcriptional program conferring the characteristic features of CD8+ T cell exhaustion, including upregulation of genes encoding inhibitory cell surface receptors and diminished TCR signaling. Expression of an engineered NFAT1, which induces this negative regulatory program in the absence of the effector program, interferes with the ability of CD8+ T cells to protect against Listeria infection or attenuate tumor growth in vivo. NFAT elicits this second program of gene expression in large part by binding to a subset of the sites occupied by NFAT during a typical effector response, suggesting that a balance between the two pathways determines the outcome of TCR signaling.

Their combined genomes (the microbiome) provide biochemical and metabolic functions that complement host physiology. Maintaining symbiosis seems to be a key requirement for health as dysbiosis is associated with the development of common diseases. Previous studies indicated that the microbiota and the host   s epithelium signal bidirectional inducing transcriptional responses to fine-tune and maintain symbiosis. However, little is known about the host   s responses to the microbiota along the length of the gut as earlier studies of gut microbial ecology mostly used either colonic or fecal samples. This is of importance as not only function and architecture of the gut varies along its length but also microbial distribution and diversity. Few recent studies have begun to investigate microbiota-induced host responses along the length of the gut. However, these reports used whole tissue samples and therefore do not allow drawing conclusions about specificity of the observed responses. Which cells in the intestinal tissue are responsible for the microbially induced response: epithelial, mesenchymal or immune cells? Where are the responding cells located? Furthermore, the gut microbiota has been implicated in epigenetic regulation of the host   s transcriptional profile. We used using extensive microarray analysis of laser capture microdissection (LCM) harvested ileal and colonic tip and crypt fractions from germ-free mice before and during the time course of colonization with a normal microbiota (on days 1, 3, 5 and 7) to investigate the microbiota-induced transcriptional responses and their kinetics in specific and well-defined cell populations of the host   s epithelium.

Cryosections were prepared from these OCT blocks and tip/crypt fractions isolated using laser capture microdissection.

The complete procedure from sacrificing the mouse until the frozen tissue blocks took less than five minutes to preserve RNA integrity. All material and solutions used further were RNase-free. 8 ?m thick cryosections were cut from the OCT blocks at -20?C using a microtome (Leica), placed onto PEN membrane slides (ZEISS) and immediately stained for LCM.

To address the biological role of Unr, we inactivated the unr gene by homologous recombination in mice and embryonic stem (ES) cells. Embryos deficient for Unr die at mid-gestation, and the main phenotypic defects observed, growth deficiency and absence of neural tube closure, suggest a role of Unr in the balance proliferation/differentiation during early development. Here, we report that in Unr-null ES cell cultures, we observed a greater proportion of partially differentiated colonies, together with  dispersed, refractile cells with stellate morphology, reminiscent of primitive endoderm (PrE) cells. DNA microarray, immunostaining, and RNA analyses revealed that Unr-null ES cells express a set of PrE markers, including the GATA6 transcription factor, a key inducer of PrE. Although Unr-deficient cells did not downregulate the pluripotency regulators Oct4, Nanog and Sox2, they grew more slowly than the wild-type lines, and their clonogenicity was lower. Silencing of Unr by RNA interference in ES E14 (129 genetic background) resulted in similar phenotypic and molecular changes as those observed in unr-/- ES cells (C57Bl/6 background). Finally, we show that ectopic expression of Unr in unr-/- ES cells partially reverses the endoderm-specific gene expression and the differentiation phenotype. We propose that Unr prevents the differentiation of ES cells into PrE, by controlling the stability of GATA6 mRNAs, since the decay of GATA6 mRNAs is increased in the absence of Unr. In summary, these results indicate that an essential function of Unr is to stabilize ES cells in a pluripotent state by repressing PrE gene expression.

However, there is little knowledge about how such sites might be achieved. Here we present evidence that prostate cancer stem-like cells (CSC) can be found in histopathologically negative prostate draining lymph nodes (PDLN) in mice harboring oncogene-driven prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN). PDLN-derived CSC were phenotypically and functionally identical to CSC obtained from mPIN lesions, but distinct from CSCs obtained from frank prostate tumors. CSC derived from either PDLN or mPIN used the extracellular matrix protein Tenascin-C (TNC) to inhibit T cell receptor-dependent T cell activation, proliferation and cytokine production. Mechanistically, TNC interacted with   5  1 integrin on the cell surface of T cells, inhibiting reorganization of the actin-based cytoskeleton therein required for proper T cell activation. CSC from both PDLN and mPIN lesions also expressed CXCR4 and migrated in response to its ligand CXCL12, which was overexpressed in PDLN upon mPIN development. CXCR4 was critical for the development of PDLN-derived CSC, as in vivo administration of CXCR4 inhibitors prevented establishment in PDLN of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Taken together, our work establishes a pivotal role for TNC in tuning the local immune response to establish equilibrium between disseminated nodal CSC and the immune system. A total of six sample of TPIN (N = 3) and TNE (N = 3) cultured cells from TRAMP mouse model were analyzed .. cancer stem-like cells obtained for prostates of mice affected by neuroendocrine tumors;  cancer stem-like cells obtained from prostates of 10-11 week old;  total RNA;  transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model;  Prostatic Cancer Stem Cells;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Methods: RNA extracted from individual mouse lungs (experimental group: n=5) were pooled and a total 1   g RNA was used for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analyses on an Illumina HiSeq 1000 sequencing system. Sequence analysis were performed in duplicate. First- and second-strand synthesis, adapter ligation and amplification of the library were performed using the Illumina TruSeq Sample Preparation Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Illumina). Library quality was evaluated by using an Agilent DNA-1000 chip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Library DNA templates were quantitated by qPCR using known reference starndards. Cluster formation of the library of DNA templates was performed using the TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3 (Illumina) and the Illumina cBot workstation. Paired-end, 50-base sequencing was performed with a TruSeq SBS kit v3 (Illumina) on the Illumina HiSeq 1000 by protocols defined by the manufacturer. Base call conversion to sequence reads was performed using CASAVA-1.8.2. Sequence data were analyzed with the Bowtie2, Tophat2 and GFOLD programs. Processed data are presented as reads per kilobase transcript per million (RPKM), normalized to the experimental control (RNA from saline-challenged lungs) and reported as fold change (test/control).  Results: We mapped an average of 24.76 million sequence reads per sample and identified 23,337 transcripts in total RNA extracted from lungs of Balb/cJ mice as described in Methods. Approximately 10% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the saline-challenged control and 8-oxoguanine-challeged mouse lungs, with a fold change    3.0. We validated the expression changes of 7 selected pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines of interest for our studies by qRT-PCR. Hierarchical clustering followed by Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships database (PANTHER) analysis of differentially expressed genes. Results showed overrepresentation of various biological functions (GO terms) including immune system process (GO:0002376; p=5.24e-12) among others. Pathway analysis (PANTHER) indicated that the most overrepresented pathway was inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine (P00031, p=<0.01). In addition to gene expression analysis, we confirmed OGG1   8-oxoG-dependent RAS activation in lungs by active RAS pull-down assays, airways neutrophil accumulation by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) differential cell counts and airway inflammation by histological examination (H&E staining) of lung sections.  Conclusions: This is the first study at the whole-transcriptome level to show induction of innate immune response gene expression in mouse lungs after exposure to OGG1-BER product 8-oxoG. Balb/cJ mice (5 per group) were intranasally challenged with 8-oxoguanine (1   M, 60   l) for 30, 60 and 120 min. Control group mice were intranasally challenged with saline (60   l). RNA from individual mice whithin the same group was pooled and subjected to deep-sequencing analysis in duplicate using NGS on an Illumina HiSeq 1000 sequencing system. After alignment and processing, the resulting RPKM from treatment groups (8-oxoG-challenged) were normalized to the control group (saline-challenged). .. 8 weeks;  female;  wild type;  total RNA;  Lung, 8-oxoG, 120min;  Lung, 8-oxoG, 30min;  Lung, 8-oxoG, 60min;  Lung, saline;  Balb/cJ;  10090;  Mus musculus;  120min;  30min;  60min;  lung;  8-oxoguanine;  saline;  Mice (5 per group) were intranasally challenged with 8-oxoguanine (1 ?M, 60 ?l) for 30, 60 and 120 min.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is normally present at thousands of copies per cell and is packaged into several hundred higher-order structures termed nucleoids. The abundant mtDNA-binding protein, TFAM (transcription factor A,mitochondrial), regulates nucleoid architecture, abundance and segregation. Complete mtDNA depletion profoundly impairs oxidative phosphorylation, triggering calcium-dependent stress signalling and adaptive metabolic responses. However, the cellular responses to mtDNA instability, a physiologically relevant stress observed in many human diseases and ageing, remain poorly defined. Here we show that moderate mtDNA stress elicited by TFAM deficiency engages cytosolic antiviral signalling to enhance the expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. Mechanistically, we find that aberrant mtDNA packaging promotes escape of mtDNA into the cytosol, where it engages the DNA sensor cGAS (also known as MB21D1) and promotes STING (also known as TMEM173)   IRF3-dependent signalling to elevate interferon-stimulated gene expression, potentiate type I interferon responses and confer broad viral resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpesviruses induce mtDNA stress, which enhances antiviral signalling and type I interferon responses during infection. Our results further demonstrate that mitochondria are central participants in innate immunity, identify mtDNA stress as a cell-intrinsic trigger of antiviral signaling and suggest that cellular monitoring of mtDNA homeostasis cooperates with canonical virus sensing mechanisms to fully engage antiviral innate immunity.

Many of these genes are co-expressed in mid-fetal human cortex, suggesting ASD risk genes converge in regulatory networks that are perturbed in ASD during neurodevelopment. To elucidate such networks we mapped promoters and enhancers bound by the chromodomain helicase CHD8, which is strongly enriched in ASD-associated de novo loss of function mutations, using ChIP-seq in mid-fetal human brain, human neural stem cells (hNSCs), and embryonic mouse cortex. We find that CHD8 targets are strongly enriched for ASD risk genes that converge in ASD-associated co-expression networks in human midfetal cortex. CHD8 knockdown in hNSCs results in significant dysregulation of ASD risk genes targeted by CHD8, as well as additional genes important for neurodevelopment, including members of the Wnt/  -catenin signaling pathway. Integration of CHD8 binding data with genetic and gene co-expression data in ASD risk models provides support for additional ASD risk genes. Together, our results suggest that loss of CHD8 function contributes to ASD through regulatory perturbation of other ASD risk genes during human cortical development.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between Gdf5 and Erg expression and downstream effects on chondrocyte gene expression.  Design: Erg expression was identified in mouse knee joints at E13.5. Expression and microarray analyses were performed using micromass cultures of murine C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells undergoing induced chondrogenesis in the presence of absence of Gdf5 and Erg.  Results: At E13.5, Erg expression was found to surround epiphyseal chondrocytes and span the interzone up to the intermediate zone. Erg splice forms were expressed in micromass cultures, and their expression profile was altered by the addition of recombinant Gdf5 depending on the stage of differentiation. Overexpression of Erg-010 resulted in a downregulation of Col2a1 and Col10a1. Microarray analysis following Erg-010 overexpression identified two potential downstream targets, Ube2b and Osr2, which were also differentially regulated by Gdf5.  Conclusion: Erg regulation by Gdf5 in mesenchymal cells in vitro is dependent on the stage of chondrogenesis, and its expression in vivo demarcates chondrocytes that are not destined to be consumed by endochondral ossification.  Functionally, Erg expression causes downregulation of Col2a1 and Col10a1 expression and this effect is potentially mediated by Osr2, which is a known regulator of chondrocyte differentiation. The identification of Ube2b as a putative downstream target of Erg-010 suggests that it may contribute to the regulation of the ubiquitination pathway and thereby BMP2 signaling, which is essential for normal knee joint development. RNA from overexpression experiments was extracted as described above. Total RNA quality was confirmed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).

These disorders are largely genetic in origin; individual mutations in any one of >200 genes cause RD, making mutation specific therapies prohibitively expensive. A better treatment plan, particularly for late stage disease, may involve stem cell transplants into the photoreceptor or ganglion cell layers of the retina. Stem cells from young mouse retinas can be transplanted, and can form photoreceptors in adult retinas. These cells can be grown in tissue culture, but can no longer form photoreceptors. We have used microarrays to investigate differences in gene expression between cultured retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that have lost photoreceptor potential, postnatal day 1 (pn1) retinas and the postnatal day 5 (pn5) retinas that contain transplantable photoreceptors. We have also compared FACS sorted Rho-eGFP expressing rod photoreceptors from pn5 retinas with Rho-eGFP negative cells from the same retinas. We have identified over 300 genes upregulated in rod photoreceptor development in multiple comparisons, 37 of which have been previously identified as causative of retinal disease when mutated. It is anticipated that this research should bring us closer to growing photoreceptors in culture and therefore better treatments for RD. This dataset is also a resource for those seeking to identify novel retinopathy genes in RD patients. We extracted whole retinas from postnatal day 1 (Pn1) and postnatal day 5 (Pn5) mice, and compared them with cultured RPCs derived from pn5 retinas, using Affymetrix mouse 430A_2 arrays. We also extracted cells from Rho-eGFP Pn5 retinas and FACS sorted them. GFP+ve cells represent immature rod photoreceptors, as they express the Rho-eGFP fusion protein, which is only expressed in rods. GFP-ve cells represent all other retinal neurons. These samples were amplified and compared using Affymetrix mouse 430A_2arrays, by Source Biosciences GMBH, Berlin, Germany. Results from immature rods were then compared with those from other retinal neurons, while results from whole Pn5 retinas were compared with Pn1 retinas (which don't yet express rod specific genes), and RPCs, which are glial precursors. RPCs were also compared with Pn1 retinas. Genes which showed changed expression profiles in at least 3/4 of comparisons were prioritised for further investigation. .. postnatal day 1;  postnatal day 5;  total RNA;  Cultured RPCs derived from postnatal retina;  GFP+ve cells from pn5 retinas, Rho-eGFP;  GFP-ve cells from pn5 retinas, Rho-eGFP;  Pooled Pn1 whole retinas, Rho-eGFP;  Pooled Pn5 whole retinas, Rho-eGFP;  129Sv/J background;  10090;  Mus musculus;  FACS sorted retina;  Homogenized retina;  cultured retinal progenitor cells;  FACS: Retinas were placed in 1ml HBSS (Lonza) and 100ul 10mg/ml trypsin (Sigma) was added.

Macrophages were then infected with Mycobacterium smegmatis for 1h, and total RNA was collected. In a parallel experiment, infected macrophages were infected for 1h, 4h and 24h. At these time points, macrophages were lysed, bacteria was collected and quantified by the Colony Forming Units (CFU) Assay. This provided the kinetics of the killing of Mycobacteria inside mouse macrophages. CFU experiments revealed that cells pre-treated with EPA showed an increased number of bacteria inside macrophages, in contrast to cells pre-treated with Cer. To dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in the survival and killing of mycobacteria infected macrophages, mediated by lipids, gene expression studies were performed. Cultures of Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 harbouring a p19-(long lived) EGFP plasmid were grown to exponential growth phase. Bacteria were pelleted, washed in PBS and resuspended in medium DMEM with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 (10 bacteria per macrophage). Clumps of bacteria were removed by ultrasonic treatment of bacterial suspensions in an ultrasonic water bath for 15 minutes, followed by a low speed centrifugation for 2 minutes.

A key aspect of CTCF   s mechanism involves bringing together distant genetic elements for intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions. Evidence from epigenetic processes, such as X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), suggests that CTCF may carry out its functions through interacting RNAs. Using genome-wide approaches to investigate the relationship between CTCF   s RNA interactome and its epigenomic landscape, here we report that CTCF interacts with thousands of transcripts in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), many in close proximity to CTCF   s genomic binding sites. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that CTCF is a high-affinity RNA binding protein that contacts RNA directly and specifically. In the XCI model, CTCF binds the active and inactive X-chromosomes allele-specifically. At the X-inactivation center, Tsix RNA binds CTCF and targets CTCF to a region associated with X-chromosome pairing. Our work implicates CTCF-RNA interactions in long-range chromosomal interactions in trans and adds a new layer of complexity to CTCF regulation. The genome-wide datasets reported here will provide a useful resource for further study of CTCF-mediated epigenomic regulation.

To evaluate the therapeutic utility of antimiR-21 oligonucleotides in chronic kidney disease, we silenced miR-21 in mice that develop Alport Nephropathy due to a defect in the Col4a3 gene. The goals of this study to assess the effect of inhibiting miR-21 in the Col4a3-/- Alport Syndrome mouse model at 9 weeks of age. Methods: Col4a3-/-, Col4a3+/-, and Col4a3+/+ mice in the 129X1/SvJ genetic background were obtained. Mice received anti   miR-21 (25 mg/kg) or control anti-miR (25mg/kg) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by inter-scapular subcutaneous injection twice per week. In some experiments mice received a range of doses from 12.5mg/kg once a week to 50mg/kg once a week. Anti   miR-21 is a high-affinity oligonucleotide complementary to the active site of miR-21. Mice received injections starting at 24 days (3.5 weeks) after birth and ending at 5, 7, 9 or 16 weeks after birth depending on the study objectives. Total RNA from kidney tissue was extracted as per manufacturer   s instructions (miREASY kit, Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed using BioAnalyzer (Agilent). mRNA expression profiles were determined using next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform producing 50bp paired-end reads. Bowtie/TopHat suites were used to align the reads to mouse genome or transcriptome and RSEM were used to quantify gene abundances. Gene level counts were then normalized with the R/Bioconductor package limma using the voom/variance stabilization method. Results: Anti-miR-21 enhanced PPAR  /RXR activity and associated downstream signaling pathways in glomerular, tubular and interstitial cells, enhanced mitochondrial function, which reduced mitochondrial ROS production and preserved tubular cell functions. In addition, inhibition of miR-21 reduced fibrogenic and inflammatory signaling in glomerular and interstitial cells, likely as a consequence of enhanced PPAR  /RXR activity and mitochondrial function. Inhibition of miR-21 represents a novel therapeutic strategy for chronic kidney diseases including Alport Nephropathy.

The mammalian somatosensory nervous system encodes the perception of specific environmental stimuli. The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contains distinct somatosensory neuron subtypes that innervate diverse peripheral tissues, mediating the detection of thermal, mechanical, proprioceptive, pruriceptive, and nociceptive stimuli. We purified discrete subtypes of mouse DRG somatosensory neurons by flow cytometry using fluorescently labeled mouse lines (SNS-Cre/TdTomato, Parv-Cre/TdTomato) in combination with Isolectin B4-FITC surface staining (IB4). This allowed identification of transcriptional differences between these major populations, revealing enrichment of voltage-gated ion channels, TRP channels, G-protein coupled receptors, transcription factors, and other functionally important classes of genes within specific somatosensory neuron subsets. SNS-Cre mice were bred with Rosa26-TdTomato mice to generate SNS-Cre/TdTomato reporter mice. Parv-Cre mice were bred with Rosa26-TdTomato mice to generate Parv-Cre/TdTomato mice. Isolectin B4-FITC was used to stain the surface of SNS-Cre/TdTomato reporter mice. We used these strategies of fluorescent labeling to purify distinct murine sensory neuron subsets from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).

The transcriptional changes that underpin mammalian cardiac regeneration have not been fully characterized at the molecular level. Objective: The objectives of our study were to determine if myocytes revert the transcriptional phenotype to a less differentiated state during regeneration and to systematically interrogate the transcriptional data to identify and validate potential regulators of this process. Methods and Results: We derived a core transcriptional signature of injury-induced cardiac myocyte regeneration in mouse by comparing global transcriptional programs in a dynamic model of in vitro and in vivo cardiac myocyte differentiation, in vitro cardiac myocyte explant model, as well as a neonatal heart resection model. The regenerating mouse heart revealed a transcriptional reversion of cardiac myocyte differentiation processes including reactivation of latent developmental programs similar to those observed during de-stabilization of a mature cardiac myocyte phenotype in the explant model. We identified potential upstream regulators of the core network, including interleukin 13 (IL13), which induced cardiac myocyte cell cycle entry and STAT6/STAT3 signaling in vitro. We demonstrate that STAT3/periostin and STAT6 signaling are critical mediators of IL13 signaling in cardiac myocytes. These downstream signaling molecules are also modulated in the regenerating mouse heart. Conclusions: Our work reveals new insights into the transcriptional regulation of mammalian cardiac regeneration and provides the founding circuitry for identifying potential regulators for stimulating heart regeneration.

Whether these two tumor suppressor mechanisms are mediated through similar or distinct signaling pathways is not known. Here we generated and analyzed knockin mice that express a series of human cancer-derived mutant alleles of PTEN that differentially alter the Akt axis in either stromal or tumor cell compartments of mammary glands. We find that cell non-autonomous tumor suppression by Pten in stromal fibroblasts strictly requires activation of P-Akt signaling, whereas cell autonomous tumor suppression in epithelial tumor cells is independent of overt canonical pathway activation.

Thus, new therapeutic targets and effective treatments are necessary. Short telomeres are risk factors for age-associated diseases including heart disease. Here, we address the potential of telomerase (Tert) activation in prevention of heart failure after MI in adult mice. We use adeno-associated viruses for cardiac-specific Tert expression in a mouse model of MI. We find that upon MI, hearts expressing Tert show attenuated cardiac dilation, improved ventricular function and smaller infarct scars concomitant with increased mouse survival by 17% compared to controls. Furthermore, Tert treatment results in elongated telomeres, increased numbers of Ki67 and pH3-positive cardiomyocytes and a gene expression switch towards a regeneration signature of neonatal mice. Our work highlights telomerase activation as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent heart failure after MI. Mice of one year of age were left untreated (control) or injected with 5*10^11 adeno associated viruses particles of serotype 9 (AAV9) that carry either en empty expression cassette or express telomerase under control of the CMV promoter. Virus injected mice then underwent myocardial infarction induced through permenant left anterior descending artery  (LAD) ligation. Mice that survived for six weeks after LAD ligation were sacrificed and 4 hearts per group (AAV9-empty or AAV9-Tert) and 3 control hearts (no virus treatment, no ligation) were subjected to total RNA isolation for micro array analysis. .. 1 year;  total RNA;  Infarct Mouse;  Infarct Mouse_with telomerase;  control Mouse;  FVB/N;  10090;  Mus musculus;  At one year of age mice were injected with AAV9 vectors with either  telomerase or an empty expression cassette. 2-3 weeks later myocardial infarction was induced via permanent LAD ligation.

The mechanisms enabling common progenitors to differentiate into distinct cell fates are not fully understood. Here, we identify chromatin-regulating and cell-fate-determining transcription factors (TF) governing dendritic cell (DC) development by annotating the enhancer and promoter landscapes of the DC lineage. Combining these analyses with detailed over-expression, knockdown and ChIP-Seq studies, we show that Irf8 functions as a plasmacytoid DC  epigenetic and fate-determining TF, regulating massive, cell-specific chromatin changes in thousands of pDC enhancers. Importantly, Irf8 forms a negative feedback loop with Cebpb, a monocyte-derived DC epigenetic fate-determining TF. We show that using this circuit logic, differential activity of TF can stably define epigenetic and transcriptional states, regardless of the microenvironment. More broadly, our study proposes a general paradigm that allows closely related cells with a similar set of signal-dependent factors to generate differential and persistent enhancer landscapes. Here analyzed 2 experiments, each one contains samples of moDC and pDC ex vivo cultured cells.

Here we describe a method that allows the integration of genomic DNA and mRNA sequencing from the same cell. We use this method to correlate DNA copy number variation to transcriptome variability among individual cells. First, hand-picked single cells are lysed and reverse transcribed using a poly-A primer including cell-specific barcodes, a 5' Illumina adapter and a T7 promoter overhang to convert mRNA to single stranded cDNA (ss cDNA). The gDNA and single stranded cDNA are then subjected to quasilinear whole genome amplification, as previously described, using an adapter with a defined 27 nucleotide sequence at the 5    end followed by 8 random nucleotides. After 7 rounds of amplification, the gDNA and cDNA are copied to generate a variety of different short amplicon (0.5   2.5 kb) species, with a majority of amplicons containing adapter Ad-2 at both ends and a small fraction of cDNA derived amplicons containing Ad-2 at one end and Ad-1x at the other. Next, the sample is split into two tubes to further amplify gDNA and cDNA. The tube used to sequence gDNA is amplified using PCR. Following sonication, adapter Ad-2 removal, and cell-specific indexed Illumina library preparation, this half is used to sequence gDNA. The tube used to sequence cDNA is converted to double-stranded cDNA and amplified using in vitro transcription such that the amplified RNA (aRNA) is uniquely produced from cDNA but not gDNA. 3    Illumina adapters are then ligated to the aRNA followed by reverse transcription and PCR, allowing quantification of mRNA. ..

During embryogenesis in the mouse it was hypothesized that PRMT5 functions with the master germline determinant BLIMP1 to promote primordial germ cell (PGC) specification. Using a Blimp1-Cre germline conditional knockout, we discovered that Prmt5 has no major role in murine germline specification, or the first global epigenetic reprogramming event involving depletion of cytosine methylation from DNA and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation from chromatin. Instead, we discovered that PRMT5 functions at the conclusion of PGC reprogramming I to promote proliferation, survival and expression of the gonadal germline program as marked by MVH. We show that PRMT5 regulates gene expression by promoting methylation of the Sm spliceosomal proteins, and significantly altering the spliced repertoire of RNAs in mammalian embryonic cells and primordial cells.

Why non-immunoglobulin loci are susceptible to AID activity is unknown. Here we study AID-mediated lesions in the context of nuclear architecture and the B cell regulome. We show that AID targets are not randomly distributed across the genome, but are predominantly clustered within super-enhancers. Unexpectedly, in these domains AID deaminates highly active promoters and eRNA+ enhancers interconnected in some instances over megabases of linear chromatin. Using genome editing we demonstrate that 3D-linked targets cooperate to recruit AID-mediated breaks. Furthermore, a comparison of hypermutation in mouse B cells, AID-induced kataegis in human lymphomas, and translocations in MEFs reveals that AID damages different genes in different cell types. Yet, in all cases, the targets are predominantly associated with topological complex, highly transcribed super-enhancers, demonstrating that these compartments are key mediators of AID recruitment.

The mechanism by which cells undergo death determines whether dying cells trigger inflammatory responses or remain immunologically silent. Mitochondria play a central role in the induction of cell death, as well as in immune signaling pathways. Here, we identify of a mechanism by which mitochondria and downstream pro-apoptotic caspases regulate the activation of antiviral immunity. In the absence of active caspases, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by Bax and Bak results in the expression of type I interferons (IFNs). This induction is mediated by mitochondrial DNA-dependent activation of the cGAS/STING pathway and results in the establishment of a potent state of viral resistance. Our results show that mitochondria have the capacity to simultaneously expose a cell-intrinsic inducer of the IFN response, and to inactivate this response in a caspase-dependent manner. This mechanism provides a dual control, which determines whether mitochondria initiate an immunologically silent or a pro-inflammatory type of cell death.  In order to determine whether the pharmacological inhibition of caspases could activate the type I interferon response, we treated WT MEFs with the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH. The inhibitor induced an increased expression of ISGs, which was dependent on type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1) signaling.

Less clear is whether intergenic lncRNAs commonly regulate transcription by modulating chromatin at genomically distant loci. Here, we report both genomically local and distal RNA-dependent roles of Dali, a conserved central nervous system expressed intergenic lncRNA. Dali is transcribed downstream of the Pou3f3 transcription factor gene and its depletion disrupts the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Locally, Dali transcript regulates transcription of the Pou3f3 locus. Distally, it preferentially targets active promoters and regulates expression of neural differentiation genes, in part through physical association with the POU3F3 protein. Dali interacts with the DNMT1 DNA methyltransferase in mouse and human and regulates DNA methylation status of CpG island-associated promoters in trans. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that a single intergenic lncRNA controls the activity and methylation of genomically distal regulatory elements to modulate large-scale transcriptional programmes.

The bone stroma consists of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and mature osteoblasts that promote cancer growth. Yet it is not completely understood what are the molecular processes guiding cancer cells progression to the bone. In this study, a co-culture assay and subsequent gene profiling arrays were used to compare the gene expression profile of a pre-osteoblastic cell line (MBA-15) with that of a mammary adenocarcinoma (DA3) cells. Following co-culture, cells were separated by magnetic beads based on the expression of CD326 antigen. RNA was purified and hybridized on gene expression array. The gene expression pattern changes were followed by qRT-PCR. We demonstrate that co-cultured DA3 cells express elevated levels of genes that regulate growth and responses to both hormonal stimulus and wounding, as well as reduced expression of genes related to lipid metabolism. Also, co-cultured pre-osteoblastic cells showed reduced expression of cell-junction genes. The study presents a simplified model system, composed of pre-osteoblastic and mammary cancer cells, that potentially mimics the molecular interactions in the tumor microenvironment which contribute to tumor-progression.

Here, we show that knockdown of Ankrd11 in developing murine or human cortical neural precursors caused decreased proliferation, reduced neurogenesis, and aberrant neuronal positioning. Similar cellular phenotypes and aberrant ASD-like behaviors were observed in Yoda mice carrying a point mutation in the Ankrd11 HDAC-binding domain. Consistent with a role for Ankrd11 in histone acetylation, Ankrd11 was associated with chromatin, colocalized with HDAC3, and expression and histone acetylation of Ankrd11 target genes were altered in Yoda neural precursors. Moreover, the Ankrd11 knockdown-mediated decrease in precursor proliferation was rescued by inhibiting histone acetyltransferase activity or expressing HDAC3. Thus, Ankrd11 is a crucial epigenetic regulator of neural development that controls histone acetylation and gene expression, thereby providing a likely explanation for its association with cognitive dysfunction and ASD.

However, the specific function of these pathways in AML is unclear. To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in AML, we employed a murine model of AML harboring Mll-AF9 and NRASG12V. We found that NRASG12V enforced leukemia self-renewal gene expression signatures and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9 and MYB-dependent gene expression program. In a multiplexed analysis of RAS-dependent signaling intermediates, the leukemia stem cell compartment was preferentially sensitive to RAS withdrawal. Use of RAS-pathway inhibitors showed that NRASG12V maintained leukemia self-renewal through mTOR and MEK pathway activation, implicating these pathways as potential targets for cancer stem cell-specific therapies.

We used iCLIP of coilin-GFP expressed in HeLa and P19 cell lines at endogenous levels to identify coilin RNA targets and investigate RNA-binding specificity. P19 cells expressing GFP fused to a nuclear localization signal (GFP-NLS) was used as a negative control. iCLIP results revealed that coilin binds several classes of ncRNA including snRNAs, U3 snoRNA and scaRNAs.

The exact mechanism allowing the derepression of polycomb target genes during cell differentiation remains unclear. Here, we show that several differentiation genes transiently recruit a Cbx8-containing Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1 during their early activation. Depletion of Cbx8 partially impairs the transcriptional activation of these genes. This correlates with a reduction in low but detectable levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation. Prolonged gene activation results in eviction of PRC1 despite persisting H3K27me3. The composition of PRC1 is highly modular and changes when ES cells commit to differentiation. We further demonstrate that the exchange of Cbx7 for Cbx8 is required for the effective activation of differentiation genes. Taken together our results establish a function for a Cbx8-containing complex in facilitating the transition from a Polycomb-repressed chromatin state to an active state. As this affects several key regulatory differentiation genes this mechanism is likely to contribute to the robust execution of differentiation programs. Four biological replicates were used for each condition (untreated and after 72h of retinoic acid stimulation) and samples were prepared and hybridized to SurePrint G3 Gene Expression Microarrays (Agilent technologies) following the supplier's instructions.

Cancer-induced anorexia is thought to be caused by an inability of food intake-regulating systems in the hypothalamus to respond adequately to negative energy balance during tumour growth. Here, we show that this impaired response of food-intake control is likely to be mediated by altered serotonin signalling and by failure in post-transcriptional neuropeptide Y (NPY) regulation. Methods: Two tumour cachectic mouse models with different food intake behaviours were used: a C26-colon adenocarcinoma model with increased food intake and a Lewis lung carcinoma model with decreased food intake. This contrast in food intake behaviour between tumour-bearing (TB) mice in response to growth of the two different tumours was used to distinguish between processes involved in cachexia and mechanisms that might be important in food intake regulation. The hypothalamus was used for transcriptomics (affymetrix chips). Results: In both models, hypothalamic expression of orexigenic NPY was significantly higher compared with controls, suggesting that this change does not directly reflect food intake status but might be linked to negative energy balance in cachexia. Expression of genes involved in serotonin signalling showed to be different between C26-TB mice and Lewis lung carcinoma-TB mice and was inversely associated with food intake. In vitro, using hypothalamic cell lines, serotonin repressed neuronal hypothalamic NPY secretion while not affecting messenger NPY expression, suggesting that serotonin signalling can interfere with NPY synthesis, transport, or secretion. Conclusions: Altered serotonin signalling is associated with changes in food intake behaviour in cachectic TB mice. Serotonins' inhibitory effect on food intake under cancer cachectic conditions is probably via affecting the NPY system. Therefore, serotonin regulation might be a therapeutic target to prevent the development of cancer-induced eating disorders.

These complex processes are determined by temporal gene expression during development, which is in turn tightly regulated by long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs. In this study, we investigated the processes implicated in the maturation of primary neuronal cultures based on RNA expression profiling. Correlation between neuron specific gene ontologies of mRNA and non-coding RNAs identified direct regulation of axonogenesis and dendritogenesis. Temporally regulated mRNA and their associated long non-coding RNAs were significantly overrepresented in proliferation and differentiation associated signalling, cell adhesion molecules and neurotrophin signalling pathways during neuronal maturation. Long non-coding RNAs associated with Axin2, Cntn1, Ncam1, Negr1, Ntrk2, Nrxn1 and Sh2b3 displayed an inverse expression profile to their mRNA whereas long non-coding RNA -mRNA pairs for Kit, Prkcb and Ralgds displayed similar expression profiles. These genes were also predicted targets of the altered miRNAs, miR-124, -128, -129-5p, -203, -218, -290-5p, -326, -329, -377 and -495. These microRNAs particularly regulate the cell adhesion molecules, Cntn1, Ncam1, Negr1 and Nrxn1 that determine axonogenesis and dendritogenesis, supporting the observed co-regulation of these biological processes by non-coding RNAs. Verification of expression of these long non-coding RNA-mRNA pairs in an in vitro model of ischemic-reperfusion injury showed an inverse expression profile, thus confirming their role(s) in maintenance of the neuronal structure and function.

Several observations suggest that also in the periphery mature Treg cells continuously receive self-reactive TCR signals. However, the importance of this inherent autoreactivity for Treg cell biology remains poorly defined. To address this open question, we genetically ablated the TCR of mature Treg cells in vivo. These experiments revealed that TCR-induced Treg lineage-defining FoxP3 expression and gene hypomethylation were uncoupled from TCR input in mature Treg cells. However, Treg cell homeostasis, cell-type-specific gene expression and suppressive function critically depend on continuous triggering of their TCR.

Based on substantial side effects of existing pharmacological approaches, efficient and safe insulin sensitization and glucose control remain critical therapeutic aims to prevent diabetic late complications 3. Here, we identify Transforming Growth Factor beta-like Stimulated Clone (TSC) 22 D4 as a critical molecular determinant of insulin signaling and glucose handling. Hepatocyte-specific inactivation of TSC22D4 enhanced insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle, while hepatic TSC22D4 overexpression blunted insulin tissue responses. Consequently, hepatic TSC22D4 inhibition both prevented and reversed hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in various diabetes mouse models, respectively. TSC22D4 was found to exert its effects on systemic glucose homeostasis - in large parts - through the transcriptional regulation of the small secretory protein lipocalin (LCN) 13 as demonstrated by chromatin recruitment and genetic rescue experiments in vivo. As hepatic TSC22D4 levels were found to be elevated in human diabetic patients, correlating with decreased insulin sensitivity and hyperglycemia, our results establish the inhibition of TSC22D4 as an attractive insulin sensitizing option in diabetes therapy. 28 BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Leprdb/J (000642) mice (12 week old ) were divided to 4 forms of treatment (n=7 per treatment group) consisting of 4 different shRNA adenoviruses (reference sample: control shRNA), LCN13 (LCN13 shRNA), TSC22D4 (TSC22D4 shRNA), TSC22D4 plus LCN13 (TSC22D4+LCN13 shRNA). 1 week after shRNA injection animals were sacrificed, liver, abdominal fat tissue, gastrocnemius tissue was immediately snap frozen. 3 representative animals of each treatment group were selected for microarray analysis (abdominal fat tissue). .. 12 weeks;  LCN13 knockdown;  LCN13_TSC22D4 knockdown;  TSC22D4 knockdown;  WT;  total RNA;  LIPO_TSC_KD_abdominal fat;  Lipo_KD_abdominal fat;  TSC_KD_abdominal fat;  control_abdominal fat;  BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ Leprdb/J (000642);  10090;  Mus musculus;  abdominal fat;  2x10^9 LCN13 shRNA + 2x10^9 control shRNA;  2x10^9 TSC22D4 shRNA + 2x10^9 LCN13 shRNA;  2x10^9 TSC22D4 shRNA + 2x10^9 control shRNA;  4x10^9 control shRNA;  mice were treated with either control (control shRNA), LCN13 (LCN13 shRNA), TSC22D4 (TSC22D4 shRNA), TSC22D4 plus LCN13 (TSC22D4+LCN13 shRNA) shRNA adenovirus at a concentration of 2x(2x10^9) plaque-forming units (pfu) recombinant virus per treatment group (control group group: 4x10^9 control shRNA; LCN13 group: 2x10^9 LCN13 shRNA + 2x10^9 control shRNA; TSC22D4 group: 2x10^9 TSC22D4 shRNA + 2x10^9 control shRNA; TSC22D4+LCN13 group: 2x10^9 TSC22D4 shRNA + 2x10^9 LCN13 shRNA);

Atonal Homolog 8 (Atoh8/Math6) is a newly identified member of the atonal-related family whose expression is induced by Neurog3 and NeuroD1 in cell culture, indicating a possible role for this gene in the endocrine differentiation program downstream of these two pro-endocrine factors. Intriguingly, available experimental evidence based on a reduced number of genes suggests that Atoh8 may negatively regulate Neurog3-targeting events. In this study, we have analyzed global changes in gene expression profiles upon exogenous expression of Atoh8 alone or in combination with Neurog3 in mouse pancreatic duct (mPAC) cells. These cells activate neuroendocrine-specific gene expression in response to Neurog3 and NeuroD1 and thus serve as an optimal model to evaluate the proendocrine activity of Atoh8.  We have compared transcriptional profiles between mPAC cells treated with a recombinant adenovirus expressing Atoh8 (Ad-Atoh8) or a control adenovirus encoding B-galactosidase (Ad-Bgal), and between cells treated with Ad-Neurog3+Ad-Bgal or cells treated with Ad-Neurog3+Ad-Atoh8. The results obtained show that Atoh8 exhibits a very modest transcriptional activity in these cells thus confirming that Atoh8 does not function as a proendocrine gene. Furthermore, our data also confirm the ability of Atoh8 to block Neurog3-dependent transcriptional activation events. However, since repression is only seen for a small subset of Neurog3 gene targets, we discard a general role of Atoh8 as a negative regulator of Neurog3 pro-endocrine activity. mPAC cells (mouse pancreatic duct cells) were divided in 6 groups according to the treatment received: 1) non-treated (control for the infection effect), 2) treated with recombinant adenoviruses coding for   -galactosidase (control for infection with one adenovirus), 3) treated with recombinant adenoviruses coding for Atonal Homolog 8, 4) treated with recombinant adenoviruses coding for Neurogenin 3, 5) treated with recombinant adenoviruses coding for   -galactosidase and Neurogenin 3 (control for the effect of two adenoviruses, being one of them Neurogenin 3), 6) treated with recombinant adenoviruses coding for Neurogenin 3 and Atonal Homolog 8.

Here, we report that Pol II is engaged at pluripotency promoters in reprogramming but remains paused and inefficiently released. We also show that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) stimulates productive transcriptional elongation of pluripotency genes by dissociating the pause release factor P-TEFb from an inactive complex containing HEXIM1. Consequently, BRD4 overexpression enhances reprogramming efficiency and HEXIM1 suppresses it, whereas Brd4 and Hexim1 knockdown do the opposite. We further demonstrate that the reprogramming factor KLF4 helps recruit P-TEFb to pluripotency promoters. Our work thus provides a mechanism for explaining the reactivation of pluripotency genes in reprogramming and unveils an unanticipated role for KLF4 in transcriptional pause release.

Quiescent pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are neuroendocrine, nestin-positive, lipid-accumulating cells whose homologues in the liver are the principal repository of Vitamin A esters.  Upon activation, lipid droplets are lost and via transdifferentiation they become the key cell type responsible for driving the severe desmoplasia that characterizes PDA.  Despite their critical role in PDA progression and chemoresistance, therapeutic strategies targeting PSCs are lacking.  Here we identified the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a master genomic regulator of PSC activation and function.  In vitro we demonstrate that VDR activation reduces expression in PSCs of genes implicated in activation, inflammation, and extracellular matrix production, as well as restoring lipid droplet integrity. In vivo, the VDR ligand calcipotriol enhances the anti-tumor effects of gemcitabine by increasing intratumoral concentration 5-fold, reducing tumor volume to near baseline and lowering metastases by more than 65%.  These findings implicate VDR as a master regulator of PSC activation and identify a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. RNA-Seq analyses was used to characterize cancer-associated changes between pre-activated (3-day culture) and activated (7-day culture) primary mouse PSCs, as well as control and PDA human PSCs.

However, the connection between these two processes is still poorly understood. Here we show that the in vivo inactivation of all Rb family genes in the mouse urothelium is sufficient to initiate BC development. The characterization of the mouse tumors revealed multiple molecular features of human BC, including the activation of E2F transcription factor and subsequent Ezh2 expression, and the activation of several signaling pathways previously identified as highly relevant in urothelial tumors. Whole transcriptional characterizations of the mouse bladder tumors revealed a significant overlap with human BC samples, and a predominant role for Ezh2 in the downregulation of gene expression programs. Importantly, we determined that in human superficial BC patients, the increased tumor recurrence and progression in these recurrences is associated with increased E2F and Ezh2 expression and Ezh2-mediated gene expression repression. Collectively, our studies provide a genetically defined model for human high-grade superficial BC and demonstrate the existence of an Rb-E2F-Ezh2 axis in bladder whose disruption can promote tumor development.

PcG repressed genes are commonly characterized by the presence of the epigenetic histone mark, H3K27me3, catalyzed by the Polycomb repressive complex 2. Here, we present in vivo evidence for a previously unrecognized plasticity of PcG-repressed genes in terminal differentiated brain neurons of parkisonian mice. We show that acute administration of the dopamine precursor, L-DOPA, induces a remarkable increase in H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation. The induction of the H3K27me3S28p histone mark specifically occurs in medium spiny neurons expressing the dopamine D1 receptors and is dependent on Msk1 kinase activity and DARPP-32-mediated inhibition of protein phosphatase-1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed that increased H3K27me3S28p was accompanied by reduced PcG binding to regulatory regions of genes. An analysis of the genome wide distribution of L-DOPA induced H3K27me3S28 phosphorylation by ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) in combination with expression analysis by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the induction of H3K27me3S28p correlated with increased expression of a subset of PcG repressed genes. We found that induction of H3K27me3S28p persisted during chronic L-DOPA administration to parkisonian mice and correlated with aberrant gene expression. We propose that dopaminergic transmission can activate PcG repressed genes in the adult brain and thereby contribute to long-term maladaptive responses including the motor complications, or dyskinesia, caused by prolonged administration of L-DOPA in Parkinsons disease. 12 mice were used for RNAseq, 4 conditions, 3 mice per condition. .. total RNA;  6-OHDA lesioned striatum, acute L-DOPA injected;  6-OHDA lesioned striatum, chronic L-DOPA injected, L-DOPA challanged;  unlesioned striatum, acute L-DOPA injected;  unlesioned striatum, chronic L-DOPA injected, L-DOPA challanged;  C57BL/6J;  10090;  Mus musculus;  striatum;  Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of fentanyl citrate (0.315 mg/ml), fluanisone (10 mg/ml) (VetaPharma, Leeds, UK), midazolam (5 mg/ml) (Hameln Pharmaceuticals, Gloucester, UK), and water (1:1:2 in a volume of 10 ml/kg) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) equipped with a mouse adaptor. 6-OHDA-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB) was dissolved in 0.02% ascorbic acid in saline at a concentration of 3 ?g of free-base 6-OHDA per microliter.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), cell lines with infinite ability to proliferate and to be differentiated into all cell types of the adult body, are important research tools for investigation of differentiation and meanwhile good models for developmental research. In the current study, genome-wide gene expression of ESCs is profiled through high throughput platform during cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation and maturation.

While the role of DNA methylation in promoter silencing has been well documented, the function of this epigenetic mark at enhancers remains unclear. Recent experiments have demonstrated that enhancers are enriched for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an oxidization product of the Tet family of 5mC dioxygenases and an intermediate of DNA demethylation. These results support the involvement of Tet proteins in the regulation of dynamic DNA methylation at enhancers. By mapping DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation at base resolution, we find that deletion of Tet2 causes extensive loss of 5hmC at enhancers, accompanied by enhancer hypermethylation, reduction of enhancer activity, and delayed gene induction in the early steps of differentiation. Our results reveal that DNA demethylation modulates enhancer activity, and its disruption influences the timing of transcriptome reprogramming during cellular differentiation. We performed traditional bisulfite sequencing, TAB-Seq, RNA-Seq, and ChIP-Seq for 6 histone modifications in two biological replicates of wild-type, Tet1-/-, and Tet2-/- mouse ES cells.

Continued activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling is attributed as one of the most important mechanisms underlying failure of therapy. Recently, the discovery of constitutively active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) adds more credence to this idea. Expression of AR-Vs in metastases portends a rapid progression of the tumor. However, the precise role of the AR-Vs in CRPC still remains unknown. ARv567es is one of the two AR variants frequently found in human CRPC xenografts and metastases. Herein, we developed a probasin (Pb) promoter-driven ARv567es transgenic mouse, Pb-ARv567es, to evaluate the role of ARv567es in both autonomous prostate growth and progression to CRPC. We found that expression of ARv567es in the prostate results in epithelial hyperplasia by 16 weeks and invasive adenocarcinoma is evident by 1 year of age. The underlying genetic cellular events involved a cell cycle-related transcriptome and differential expression of a spectrum of genes that are critical for tumor initiation and progression. These findings indicate that ARv567es could induce tumorigenesis de novo and signifies the critical role of AR-Vs in CRPC. Thus, the Pb-ARv567es mouse could provide a novel model in which the role of AR variants in prostate cancer progression can be examined. Custom Agilent 44K whole mouse genome expression oligonucleotide microarrays were used to profile prostate tissue from probasin (Pb) promoter-driven ARv567es transgenic mice and control littermates.

We previously showed that oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) can be transformed into glioma when mutations are introduced perinatally. However, adult OPCs rarely proliferate compared to their perinatal counterparts. Whether these relatively quiescent cells have the potential to transform is unknown, which is a critical question considering the late onset of human glioma. Additionally, the events taking place between initial mutation and a fully developed tumor mass (pre-malignant phase) are particularly poorly understood in glioma. Here we used a temporally controllable Cre transgene to delete p53 and NF1 specifically in adult OPCs, and demonstrated that these cells consistently give rise to malignant gliomas. To investigate the transforming process of quiescent adult OPCs, we then tracked these cells throughout the pre-malignant phase, which revealed a dynamic multi-step transformation, starting with rapid but transient hyper-proliferative reactivation, followed by a long period of dormancy, then final malignant transformation. Using pharmacological approaches, we discovered that mTOR signaling is critical for both the initial OPC reactivation step and late stage tumor cell proliferation, and thus might be a potential target for both glioma prevention and treatment. In summary, our results firmly establish the transforming potential of adult OPCs, and reveal an actionable multi-phasic reactivation process that turns slowly dividing OPCs into malignant gliomas. 44K Mouse Development Oligo Microarrays from Agilent Technologies were used for microarray analysis.

The development and function of Tregs are dependent on transcriptional factor Foxp3, but how constant expression of Foxp3 is maintained in Tregs is not clear.  Here we show that ablation of the conserved non-coding DNA sequence 2 (CNS2) at the Foxp3 locus in mice led to spontaneous lymphoproliferative disease and exacerbation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). CNS2 is required for activated Treg cells to maintain elevated Foxp3 expression, which is critical for their suppressor function and lineage stability. Mechanistically, upon TCR stimulation, NFAT binds to both CNS2 and Foxp3 promoter and mediates the interaction between CNS2 and Foxp3 promoter. Our findings demonstrated an essential role for CNS2 in maintaining the stability and function of activated Treg cells and identified NFAT as a key mediator of its function. Gene expression was profiled in T regulatory cells (Treg) in WT and CNS2 knockout mice.   CNS2 knockout mice lack a conserved non-coding DNA sequence 2 (CNS2) at the Foxp3 locus.

To do this, two pairs of Gata3-floxed and control pro-T cells were generated and analyzed by RNA-seq within the first day of deletion of the Gata3 gene. Pro-T cells were generated by differentiation in vitro on OP9-DL1 monolayers of fetal liver-derive precursors from wildtype or Gata3-floxed mice, and the Gata3 gene was acutely deleted by transduction with Cre retroviral vector.  Within 20 hr after transduction, samples of acutely Gata3-deleted and control DN2 cells were sorted and RNA prepared for RNA-seq analysis.   High-throughput sequencing of the samples was carried out.   Experimental Gata3 deleted samples in both cases were Gata3-floxed, ROSA26R-EYFP samples infected with Cre retrovirus and sorted for EYFP+ (Cre-activated) DN2 phenotype.

Upon activation, the UPR machinery elicits a general suppression of protein synthesis and activation of stress gene expression, which act coordinately to restore protein folding homeostasis. We report here that UPR activation promotes the release of signal sequence-encoding mRNAs from the ER to the cytosol as a mechanism to decrease protein influx into the ER.  This release of mRNA begins rapidly, then gradually recovers with ongoing stress. Upon release into the cytosol, these mRNAs have divergent fates: some synthesize full-length proteins, while others are translationally inactive and retain nascent protein chains. Together, these findings identify the dynamic subcellular localization of mRNAs and translation as a regulatory feature of the cellular response to protein folding stress.

RUNX1 and RUNX3 are frequently associated with leukemias, yet the basis for their involvement in leukemogenesis is not fully understood. Here we show that Runx1;Runx3 double knockout (DKO) mice exhibited lethal phenotypes due to bone marrow failure and myeloproliferative disorder. These contradictory clinical manifestations are reminiscent of human inherited bone marrow failure syndromes like Fanconi anemia (FA), caused by defective DNA repair. Indeed, Runx1;Runx3 DKO cells showed mitomycin C hypersensitivity, due to impairment of monoubiquitinated-FANCD2 recruitment to DNA damage foci, although FANCD2 monoubiquitination in the FA pathway was unaffected. RUNX1 and RUNX3 interact with FANCD2 independent of CBF  , suggesting non-transcriptional role for RUNX in DNA repair. These findings suggest that RUNX dysfunction causes DNA repair defect, besides transcriptional misregulation, and promotes development of leukemias and other cancers. 6 mice were analyzed in this study. 3 Runx1;Runx3 double knockout cKit+Sca1+Lin- hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were compared with their wild type littermate controls.

Although current treatments improve survival rates, patients suffer severe treatment-related side effects and often relapse of tumors carrying resistance mutations, underscoring an urgent need for alternative targeted therapies. Currently, the genetic alterations underlying this disease are not fully understood. Here we identify GNAS, encoding the G-protein Gs-alpha, as a potent tumor suppressor gene in medulloblastoma. GNAS specifically defines a subset of aggressive Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-group medulloblastomas. Gnas loss-of-function in distinct lineage progenitors of the developing hindbrain suffices to initiate medulloblastoma. We find that Gs-alpha is highly enriched at primary cilia of granule neuron precursors and suppresses Shh signaling not only by regulating classic cAMP-dependent pathway but also controlling ciliary trafficking of Smoothened. Concurrent cAMP elevation and Smoothened inhibition robustly arrests tumor cell growth in Gnas mutants. We further reveal oligodendrocyte progenitors as a novel cellular origin for anatomically-distinct Shh-associated medulloblastomas. Together, we identify a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function of Gs-alpha in medulloblastoma partially mediated through inhibiting Shh signaling, and uncover Gs-alpha as a molecular link across disparate cells of origin among Shh-group medulloblastomas, pointing to G- protein modulation as a potential therapeutic avenue. Transgenic medulloblastoma mouse models were analyzed by Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.1 ST Array in order to determine their molecular subgroup.

Ectopic over-expression of YAP1 in mouse liver led to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the world, and accounts for an estimated 600,000 deaths annually. Lack of molecular classification and clinical heterogeneity of this malignant disease hampered the development of standardized treatment.

Apparent ribosome footprints outside of protein-coding regions raise the possibility of artifacts unrelated to translation, particularly when they occupy multiple, overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Here we show hallmarks of translation in these footprints: co-purification with the large ribosomal subunit, response to drugs targeting elongation, trinucleotide periodicity, and initiation at early AUGs. We develop a metric for distinguishing between 80S footprints and nonribosomal sources using footprint size distributions, which validates the vast majority of footprints outside of coding regions. We present evidence for polypeptide production beyond annotated genes, including induction of immune responses following human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Translation is pervasive on cytosolic transcripts outside of conserved reading frames, and direct detection of this expanded universe of translated products enables efforts to understand how cells manage and exploit its consequences.

Further emphasizing the connection with gene expression, we find that 5hmC is enriched in active thymus-specific enhancers, and that genes encoding key transcriptional regulators display high intragenic 5hmC levels in precursor cells at those developmental stages where they exert a positive effect. Our data constitute a valuable resource that will facilitate detailed analysis of the role of 5hmC in T cell development and differentiation.

A subset of these single cell populations is analysed individually via Fluidigm single cell analysis. This analysis will determine the transcriptional profile of each cell type, identify compartment specific transcripts, compartment specific transcript isoforms and cell-type specific long-noncoding RNAs.

It has also been suggested to play important roles in stem cell maintenance for both normal and cancer tissues. However, the mechanisms by which hypoxia-driven epigenetic changes modulate tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. As the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) demethylase Jmjd1a and methyltransferase G9a are upregulated downstream targets of hypoxia, we focused on these two catalytically opposing epigenetic modifiers to address this question. Through the use of homozygous Jmjd1a and G9a knockout mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, we found that Jmjd1a was not required for stem cell self-renewal and that anti-angiogenesis related genes were epigenetically dysregulated in both Jmjd1a- and G9a deficient ES cells under hypoxic conditions, accompanied by corresponding changes in H3K9 dimethylation and H3K4 trimethylation levels in the proximal promoter regions of these target genes. Most importantly, these genetic alterations led to opposing tumor phenotypes: loss of Jmjd1a results in increased tumor growth, whereas loss of G9a produces smaller tumors. These findings provide new insights on the importance of hypoxia signalling in regulating the epigenetic status and expression of angiogenesis genes that promote tumor progression. 63 microarray samples consisting of 7 mouse ES cell lines of which 2 are wild type (control), 2 Jmjd1a knockout, 2 G9a knockout and 1 G9a knockout that was reconstituted for G9a (G9a control). Each cell line and condition was seeded at 3 different densities (2X10^5, 4X10^5 and 6X10^5) in 6 cm dishes to control for the effects of cell confluency on gene expression. 18 hours after plating, the cells were subjected to normoxia (21% O2) for 24 hours (control), normoxia 20 hours followed by hypoxia (1% O2) for 4 hours (acute hypoxia) and 24 hours hypoxia (chronic treatment).

However, the underlying mechanisms of these host-microbiota interactions remain unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize effects of the microbiota on the host epithelium using a novel gastrointestinal model based on mouse organoids. We have explored the transcriptional response of organoids upon exposure to short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and products generated by two conspicuous members of the gastrointestinal microbiota; Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. We observed that A. muciniphila metabolites affect a large variety of transcription factors and genes involved in cellular lipid metabolism and growth, supporting previous in vivo findings. F. prausnitzii products exerted only a weak effect on the host transcription profile. While, A. muciniphila, and its main metabolite propionate, both stimulate fasting-induced adipose factor/angiopoietin-like protein 4 (Fiaf/Angptl4) and Ppar? expression, important regulators of lipolysis and satiety. This work illustrates that specific members of the microbiota and their metabolites differentially modulate epithelial transcription in mouse organoid lines. Organoid culture:In short, murine (WT C57BL/6) small intestinal crypts were isolated and embedded in 250   l Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and submerged in 500 ul basal culture medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, HEPES, Glutamax, N2, B27, N-acetylcysteine, and the murine growth factors EGF, noggin, and R-spondin-1 (ENR), as previously described (Sato et al., 2009.

Organoids were passaged every 7 days with a 1:4 splitting ratio.Exposure to bacterial cultures and SCFA:A. muciniphila (ATTC BAA-835) was grown anaerobically at 37C in a basal liquid medium which contained (per liter of deionized water) the following: 0.4g KH2PO4, 0.669g, Na2HPO4 + 2H2O, 0.3g NH4CL, 0.3gNaCl, 0.1g MgCl2 + 6H2O, 10g casitone, 1mM L-threonine, 1 ml trace mineral solution, 5mM L-fucose, and 5mM D-glucose.F. prausnitzii strain A2-165 (DSM 17677) was grown anaerobically at 37  C a liquid medium which contained (per liter of deionized water) the following: 10 g casitone, 2.5 g yeast extract, 4 g NaHCO3, 1 ml resazurine (0.1%w/v), 0.45g K2HPO4, 0.45g KH2PO4, 0.9g (NH4)2SO4, 0.9g NaCL, 0.09g MgSO4, 0.09g CaCL2, 2.5 mM acetate, 9 mM propionate, 1 mM n-valerate, 1 mM isovalerate, 1 mM isobutyrate, 0.28g KOH, 2.5 ml ethanol (95%), 10 mg haemin,, 10 ug biotin, 10 ug cobalamin, 30 ug para-aminobenzoic acid, 50 ug folic acid, 150 ug pyridoxamine, 1 g L-cysteine, and 25 mM glucose (Duncan et al., 2002.

Mesp1 has been proposed to mark the most primitive multipotent cardiac progenitors common for both heart fields. Here, using clonal analysis of the earliest prospective cardiovascular progenitors in a temporally controlled manner during the early gastrulation, we found that Mesp1 progenitors consist of two temporally distinct pools of progenitors restricted to either the FHF or the SHF. FHF progenitors were unipotent, while SHF progenitors, were either uni- or bipotent. Microarray and single cell RT-PCR analysis of Mesp1 progenitors revealed the existence of molecularly distinct populations of Mesp1 progenitors, consistent with their lineage and regional contribution. Altogether, these results provide evidence that heart development arises from distinct populations of unipotent and bipotent cardiac progenitors that independently express Mesp1 at different time points during their specification, revealing that the regional segregation and lineage restriction of cardiac progenitors occurs very early during gastrulation. We used microarrays to characterize the molecular mechanisms that control Mesp1 progenitor specification and lineage segregation during the early stage of cardiac mesoderm formation, 50 Mesp1 H2B-GFP+ or Mesp1 H2B-GFP- cells at E6.5 or E7.5 from mouse embryos were sorted for RNA extraction, amplification and hybridization on Affimetrix microarrays.

NT-iPSCs were established to reflect the combination of nuclear transfer and iPS technologies. iPSCs, NT-ESCs, and NT-iPSCs were exactly derived from the same MEF cells. The results indicate NT-ESCs give expression to the unique miRNAs other than both ESCs and iPSCs while pluripotent cells acquire or retain the pluripotent specific miRNAs compared with MEF. Furthermore, the comparison of different reprogramming cells suggests that several miRNAs have key roles in distinctly developmental potential reprogrammine cells.

We used microarrays to define the sets of genes that are regulated by Geminin during cell fate acquisition in embryoid bodies, using Dox-inducible Geminin knockdown or overexpression mouse embryonic stem cell lines. ES cell lines for Geminin over-expression (GemOE) were treated without or with Dox from day 3 to day 5 of EB differentiation and were collected on days 4 or 5 for microarray analysis. Gem knockdown (KD) ES cell lines were treated without or with Dox from day 0 to day 4 of EB differentiation and were collected on day 4 for microarray analysis. .. 129P2/OlaHsd;  embryoid bodies;  4;  5;  Dox added day 0;  Dox added day 3;  no Dox;  A2lox;  Geminin knockdown;  Geminin overexpression;  total RNA;  day 4 embryoid bodies, GemKD, no dox control;  day 4 embryoid bodies, GemOE, no dox control;  day 4 embryoid bodies, dox from day 0 Gem knockdown;  day 4 embryoid bodies, dox from day 3 Gem overexpression;  day 5 embryoid bodies, GemOE, no dox control;  day 5 embryoid bodies, dox from day 3 Gem overexpression;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Embryoid bodies from the Gem knockdown line were collected on day 4.

Here we show that expression of Id2 and Id3 in Treg cells was required to suppress development of fatal inflammatory disease. We found that T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-driven signaling initially decreased the abundance of Id3, which led to the activation of a follicular regulatory T (TFR) cell   specific transcription signature. However, sustained lower abundance of Id2 and Id3 interfered with proper development of TFR cells. Depletion of Id2 and Id3 expression in Treg cells resulted in compromised maintenance and localization of the Treg cell population. Thus, Id2 and Id3 enforce TFR cell checkpoints and control the maintenance and homing of Treg cells.

We investigated the effects of soybean extracts in senescence-accelerated (SAMP10) mice. This mouse is a model of brain senescence with a short life span, cerebral atrophy and cognitive dysfunction. Mice were fed a diet containing soybean extracts from 1 to 12 months of age. The effects of green and yellow soybean extracts were compared with a control diet without soybean extracts. Cognitive functions were higher in aged mice fed green soybean than age-matched control mice and mice fed yellow soybean. We further investigated transcriptome of the SAMP10 hippocampus indicated that expression levels of 36 genes were significantly higher and 19 genes were lower in mice that ingested green soybean than in mice that ingested yellow soybean. Some of the evidences were reconfirmed by real time PCR analysis; the levels of Cdh1 and Ptgds mRNA were significantly higher and that the level of Aplp1 was significantly lower in aged SAMP10 mice fed green soybean than mice ingested yellow soybean and control mice. Additionally, the amount of amyloid beta 40 and 42 was lower in the insoluble fraction of aged SAMP10 mice fed green soybean than control mice and mice fed yellow soybean, although the levels of amyloid beta 40 and 42 in the soluble fraction were not different. Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) has been proposed as the endogenous amyloid beta - chaperone, suggesting that amyloid aggregation was lower in mice fed green soybean than control mice and mice fed yellow soybean. These results indicate that the intake of green soybean improved cognitive function in aged mice, and suppressed amyloid beta accumulation.

We used Aldh1l1-GFP as a marker for gliogenic radial glia and later-stage precursors of developing astrocytes and performed gene expression profiling of these cells. We then used this dataset to identify candidate transcription factors that may serve as glial markers or regulators of glial fate. Our analysis generated a database of developmental stage-related markers of Aldh1l1+ cells between murine embryonic day 13.5-18.5. Using these data we identify the bZIP transcription factor Nfe2l1 and demonstrate that it promotes glial fate under direct Sox9 regulatory control.

We systematically analyzed the contribution of translational regulation to the early phase of macrophage activation. While the expression of most cytokines is regulated by changes in mRNA levels, de-repression of translation was found to permit expression of many feedback inhibitors of the inflammatory response. This includes NF-kB inhibitors (IkBd, IkBz, Nr4a1, Ier3), a p38 MAPK antagonist (Dusp1) and post-transcriptional suppressors of cytokine expression (TTP and Zc3h12a). Ier3 is tightly co-regulated with TNF at the level of mRNA abundance and translation. Macrophages lacking Ier3 show reduced survival upon activation, indicating that induction of Ier3 is required to protect macrophages from lipopolysaccharide-induced cell death. Our analysis reveals an important role of translational regulation in the resolution of inflammation and macrophage survival. RNA was purified from cytoplasmic lysate or polysome fractionation before and 1 h after stimulation of RAW264.7 macrophages with LPS. Fractions were pooled into four samples per condition: Free RNA (F), 40S-associated RNA (S), light (L) and heavy polysomes (H).

Prevailing theory suggests that long-term memory encoding involves early plasticity within hippocampal circuits, while reorganization of the neocortex is thought to occur weeks to months later to subserve remote memory storage. Here we report that long-term memory encoding can elicit early transcriptional, structural and functional remodeling of the neocortex. Parallel studies using genome-wide RNA-sequencing, ultrastructural imaging, and whole-cell recording in wild-type mice suggest that contextual fear conditioning initiates a transcriptional program in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that is accompanied by rapid expansion of the synaptic active zone and postsynaptic density, enhanced dendritic spine plasticity, and increased synaptic efficacy. To address the real-time contribution of the mPFC to long-term memory encoding, we performed temporally precise optogenetic inhibition of excitatory mPFC neurons during contextual fear conditioning. Using this approach, we found that real-time inhibition of the mPFC inhibited activation of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit and impaired the formation of long-term associative memory. These findings suggest that encoding of long-term episodic memory is associated with early remodeling of neocortical circuits, identify the prefrontal cortex as a critical regulator of encoding-induced hippocampal activation and long-term memory formation, and have important implications for understanding memory processing in healthy and diseased brain states. 4 biological replicates per group were analyzed.

Using transcriptomic and epigenomic mapping, we show that a small fraction of transcripts are differentially expressed between mESCs and mEpiSCs and these genes show expected changes in chromatin at their promoters and enhancers. Unexpectedly, the cis-regulatory circuitry of genes that are expressed at identical levels between these cell states also differs dramatically. In mESCs, these genes are associated with dominant proximal enhancers and dormant distal enhancers, which we term seed enhancers. In mEpiSCs, the na  ve-dominant enhancers are lost, and the seed enhancers take up primary transcriptional control. Seed enhancers have increased sequence conservation and show preferential usage in downstream somatic tissues, often expanding into super enhancers. We propose that seed enhancers ensure proper enhancer utilization and transcriptional fidelity as mammalian cells transition from na  ve pluripotency to a somatic regulatory program.

Cell-cell communication between the maternal endometrium and the pre-implantation embryo can occur by several means. Here, we show that maternal miRNAs are secreted by the endometrial epithelium to the endometrial fluid. Microarray assessments revealed the presence of specific miRNAs that are associated with the window of implantation and therefore in direct contact with the human preimplantation embryo. These miRNAS are transported as free or exosome-associated molecules secreted to the endometrial fluid and then uptake into the pre-implantation embryo through the trophoectoderm. Finally, these maternal miRNAs were able to induce transcriptional and functional modifications of the embryo. Therefore, we propose an innovative model whereby endometrial maternal miRNAS may function as transcriptomic regulators during early embryo development offering a new perspective on the developmental origins of adult diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and others that are now recognized to reflect intrauterine conditions.

However, each LSP also detects a smaller set of isoforms which are characterized both by lower coverage and lower FPKM than that observed for the common ones among LSPs. This characteristic is particularly critical in case of low input RNA NuGEN v2 LSP. The effect of statistical detection of alternative splicing considering low input LSP (NuGEN v2) with respect to high input LSP (TruSeq) was studied using a benchmark dataset, in which both synthetic reads and reads generated from high and low input LSPs were spiked-in. Statistical detection of alternative splicing was done using prototypes of bioinformatics analysis for isoform-reconstruction and exon-level analysis. Each available sample contains a total of 5 paired end replicates. 3 samples contain increasing numbers of spiked-in reads (20, 40, 80 millions) from NuGENv2 library preparation kit on a common TruSeq 1000ng background. 3 additional samples were built with the same approach, but spiked-in reads were collected from a TruSeq-based experiment. The remaining 6 samples follow the same approach of the previous 6, but the common background is based on a TruSeq library preparation on 100ng of material ..

Calcium release from intracellular stores due to T cell receptor and pre-T cell receptor signaling is thought to require the inositol triphosphate receptors (Itpr), however the requirement for these receptors has not been investigated. We used microarrays to examine gene expression differences between control and Itpr deficient T cell progenitors. We used microarrays to identify changes in the transcriptional programme of developing T cells prior to acquisition of a mature T cell receptor and identified several developmentally important genes altered in the absence of Itpr. Thymocyte progenitors at DN4 or ISP were harvested for RNA extraction from three independent control Itpr1/Itpr2/Itpr3 triple homozygous floxed (CTL) or Tie2-Cre Itpr1/Itpr2/Itrp3 triple homozygous floxed (KO)  thymii, pooled, and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrarys. To obtain a homogenous population of thymocyte progenitors, we FACS purified cells and collect RNA from only DN4 or ISP T cells. ISP T cells were defined as CD4- CD8+ CD24+ CD3-. DN4 T cells were defined as CD45+ CD24+ CD3- CD4- CD8- CD25- CD44- CD19- B220- gdTCR- Ter119- Mac1- Gr1-.

However, given its recent development and the proliferation of library construction methods, understanding the bias it introduces is incomplete but critical to realizing its value.  Results: We present a method, in vitro transcription sequencing (IVT-seq), for identifying and assessing the technical biases in RNA-seq library generation and sequencing at scale. We created a pool of over 1,000 in vitro transcribed RNAs from a full-length human cDNA library and sequenced them with polyA and total RNA-seq, the most common protocols. Because each cDNA is full length, and we show in vitro transcription is incredibly processive, each base in each transcript should be equivalently represented. However, with common RNA-seq applications and platforms, we find 50% of transcripts have more than two-fold and 10% have more than 10-fold differences in within-transcript sequence coverage. We also find greater than 6% of transcripts have regions of dramatically unpredictable sequencing coverage between samples, confounding accurate determination of their expression. We use a combination of experimental and computational approaches to show rRNA depletion is responsible for the most significant variability in coverage, and several sequence determinants also strongly influence representation.  Conclusions: These results show the utility of IVT-seq for promoting better understanding of bias introduced by RNA-seq. We find rRNA depletion is responsible for substantial, unappreciated biases in coverage introduced during library preparation. These biases suggest exon-level expression analysis may be inadvisable, and we recommend caution when interpreting RNA-seq results. 5 rRNA-depleted samples with duplicates, 1 polyA selected, 1 total RNA, and 1 plasmid library all without replicates. ..

Transgenic mice expressing platelet-derived growth factor C (Pdgf-c) under the control of the albumin promoter provide a unique animal model that mimics the step-wise disease progression in humans from fibrosis to HCC. The livers of Pdgf-c Tg mice show evidence of liver injury, including inflammation, proliferation, fibrosis and steatosis, and as the mice age, angiogenesis and dysplasia. Eighty-five percent of these mice develop HCC spontaneously, and have reduced survival that is related to their liver pathology. Through measurement of protein, RNA, and histological markers, we provide evidence to support the hypothesis that changes in liver stromal cells play an essential role in tumorigenesis in this model. A paracrine signaling model is proposed where ectopic expression of Pdgf-c in hepatocytes results in activation of hepatic stellate cells, which subsequently activates endothelial and Kupffer cells. Activation of these non-parenchymal cells promotes the release of hepatocyte growth factors that, together with changes in extracellular matrix, lead to the formation of HCC. Pdgf-c Tg mice provide a useful pre-clinical model in which to test novel drugs for chronic liver disease and HCC that focus on blocking the processes that alter the liver's fibrotic microenvironment. Two strains of mice, C57BL/6 and C57/BL6 Pdgf-c transgenic, were analyzed to see if liver stromal cells play an essential role in tumorigenesis. .. stromal cells;  Pdgf-c transgenic;  wildtype;  total RNA;  stromal cells, Pdgf-c transgenic;  stromal cells, wildtype;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;

Here we show that bacterial bile salt hydrolase (BSH) controls a microbe-host dialogue which functionally regulates host lipid metabolism and weight gain. Expression of cloned BSH enzymes in the GI tract of gnotobiotic or conventional mice significantly altered plasma bile acid signatures and regulated transcription of key genes involved in lipid metabolism (PPARgamma angptl4), cholesterol metabolism (abcg5/8), gastrointestinal homeostasis (regIIIgamma) and circadian rhythm (dbp, per1/2) in the liver or small intestine. High-level expression of BSH in conventionally raised mice resulted in significant reduction of host weight-gain, plasma cholesterol and liver triglycerides. We demonstrate that bacterial BSH activity significantly impacts systemic metabolic processes and adiposity in the host, and represents a key mechanistic target for the control of obesity and hypercholesterolaemia. Germ free Swiss Webster mice were monocolonised with EC containing the bacterial gene, Bile salt hydroalse. The treatment groups and relevant controls were;1. Germ Free(GF) n=4 ,2. GF and EC n=4,3.

To build a large panel of diverse host responses to viral infection, we took advantage of the genetic diversity present in the 8 founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse resource. Extensive pulmonary host-response profiling was performed on mock and viral-infected lungs at 2 and 4 days post-infection using total RNA-Seq. Overall lncRNAs accounted for about 40% of total genes differentially expressed upon infections (5,329 DE lncRNAs). To predict the functions of these lncRNAs, we constructed a co-expression network using the weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and identified modules of co-expressed genes. Several lncRNAs were identified as belonging to gene modules associated with viral replication or weight loss, and enriched in various infection-related biological processes such as immune response. In addition, each lncRNA was individually annotated using ranked list of DE genes based on signed correlation with each LncRNA. We predicted that a few lncRNAs may be implicated in more than 50 biological processes or pathways. Finally, we identified the lncRNAs that were positively or negatively correlated with all their neighbors and may have cis enhancer or inhibitor effects. We validated our prediction by examining additional RNASeq dataset of mice treated with IFN-alpha. Altogether, these results provide a broad categorization of lncRNA functions and identify subsets of lncRNAs with potential key roles for respiratory virus pathogenesis. These data are fully accessible through The MOuse NOn-Code Lung database (MONOCLdb) http://monocldb.viromics.washington.edu/ At 2 or 4 days post infection, Collaborative Cross founders mice (n=2-3 for infected conditions, n=2 for mocks) were euthanized and lungs were used for total RNA-Seq. ..

In mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) models, co-expression of BCR-ABL and Hes1 induces CML-BC   like disease; however the underlying mechanism remained elusive. Here, based on gene expression analysis, we show that MMP-9 is upregulated by Hes1 in common myeloid progenitors (CMPs). Analysis of promoter activity demonstrated that Hes1 upregulated MMP-9 by activating NF-kB. Analysis of 20 samples from CML-BC patients showed that MMP-9 was highly expressed in three, with two exhibiting high levels of Hes1 expression. Interestingly, MMP-9 deficiency impaired the cobblestone area-forming ability of CMPs expressing BCR-ABL and Hes1 that were in conjunction with a stromal cell layer. In addition, these CMPs secreted MMP-9, promoting the release of soluble Kit-ligand (sKitL) from stromal cells, thereby enhancing proliferation of the leukemic cells. In accordance, mice transplanted with CMPs expressing BCR-ABL and Hes1 exhibited high levels of sKitL as well as MMP-9 in the serum. Importantly, MMP-9 deficiency impaired the development of CML-BC   like disease induced by BCR-ABL and Hes1 in mouse BMT models. The present results suggest that Hes1 promotes the development of CML-BC, partly through MMP-9 upregulation in leukemic cells.

All these processes are controlled by the sequential activation of myogenic regulatory factors, and especially MYOD1 is activated in the early phase to promote the transcription of muscle-specific genes coding for muscle proteins such as alpha-actin, myosin heavy chain and muscle creatine kinase.

It is currently unclear how their epigenome underpin the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of these states of pluripotency. Here, we performed the first qualitative and quantitative comparison of DNA methylation between ESCs and EpiSCs. The global level and genomic distribution of DNA methylation were very similar between the two cell types. However, the analysis of promoter methylation patterns in EpiSCs revealed several distinct features: (i) the repression of germline-related genes by DNA methylation, a process already ongoing in ESCs but far more pronounced in EpiSCs; (ii) the hypermethylation of promoters (especially CpG rich) in EpiSC compared to both ESCs and dissected epiblasts from E6.5 and E7.5 embryos; (iii) the inability of hypomethylated (Dnmt-deficient) ESCs to be converted into EpiSCs despite their ability to self-renew.

Here we describe an important mechanism that contributes to this decline via Wip1-dependent regulation of neuronal differentiation. We found that Wip1 is expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) of the mouse subventricular zone and its upregulation at physiological levels maintained higher NPC numbers and neuronal differentiation in old mice. This resulted in markedly improved neuron formation and rescued a functional defect in fine odor discrimination in old mice. We identified Dkk3 as a key downstream target of Wip1 and found that its expression in SVZ is restricted to NPCs. Functionally, Dkk3 inhibited neuroblast formation by suppressing Wnt signaling, while deletion of Dkk3 or pharmacological reactivation of the Wnt pathway improved neuron formation and olfactory function in aged mice. We propose that Wip1 controls a Dkk3-dependent inhibition of neuronal differentiation during aging and thus regulating Wip1 levels could prevent certain aspects of functional decline of the aging brain. We found if neurospheres were derived from 18 months old mice, Wip1 transgenic neurospheres were more neurogenic than wt ones. This microarray was a pilot experiment to search the mechanism how Wip1 Transgene promoted neurogenesis, and found Dkk3 as a potential mediator.

Most studies of mouse NK cells, however, have focused on conventional NK (cNK) cells found in the spleen. Recently, we described two populations of NK cells within the liver, tissue-resident NK (trNK) cells and those resembling splenic cNK cells. However, the lineage relationship of trNK to cNK cells was unclear because trNK cells display a phenotype associated with immature, developing cNK cells. Moreover, liver trNK cells could be related to thymic NK cells or alternatively, a lineage distinct from both cNK and thymic NK cells. Herein we used detailed transcriptomic, flow cytometric, and functional analysis of mice deficient in several transcription factors to determine that liver trNK cells form a distinct lineage from cNK and thymic NK cells, especially because they do not require NFIL3 (E4BP4), the previously described NK cellspecification factor. Analysis of other tissues indicate the presence of trNK cells in skin and uterus with different transcription factor requirements. Thus, there are at least four distinct lineages of NK cells: cNK, thymic, liver (and skin) trNK, and uterine trNK cells. Liver DX5-CD49+, liver DX5+CD49-, spleen DX5+ CD49- populations of NK cells were sorted with FACS pooling cells from individual mice to end up with ~100k cells for each samples. mRNA was derived from lysates using Invitrogen oligo-dT beads ..

In response to accumulating A   peptide species, microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, generate a toxic inflammatory response that accelerates synaptic and neuronal injury. Many pro-inflammatory signaling pathways are linked to progression of neurodegeneration. However, endogenous anti-inflammatory pathways capable of suppressing A  -induced inflammation represent a relatively unexplored area. Here we hypothesized that signaling through the prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) EP4 receptor potently suppresses microglial inflammatory responses to A  42 peptides. In cultured microglial cells, EP4 stimulation attenuated levels of A  42-induced inflammatory factors and potentiated phagocytosis of A  42. Microarray analysis was performed and demonstrated that EP4 stimulation broadly opposed A  42-driven gene expression changes in microglia, with enrichment for targets of IRF1, IRF7, and NF-  B transcription factors. Primary microglia were isolated from the brains of postnatal day 7 C57BL/6J mouse pups using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P), MACS Separation Columns (LS), and magnetic CD11b Microbeads from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA).

In this report we investigate the properties of a targeted mutation that disrupts pRB interactions with the transactivation domain of E2Fs. Mice that carry this mutation endogenously (Rb1   G) are defective in regulating E2F target genes. Surprisingly, cell cycle regulation in Rb1   G/   G MEFs strongly resembles that of wild type. In a serum deprivation induced cell cycle exit, Rb1   G/   G MEFs display a similar magnitude of E2F target gene derepression as Rb1-/-, even though Rb1   G/   G cells exit the cell cycle normally. Interestingly, cell cycle arrest in Rb1   G/   G MEFs is responsive to p16 expression, indicating that the   G-pRB protein can be activated in G1 to arrest proliferation through non-E2F mechanisms. Some Rb1   G/   G mice die neonatally with a muscle degeneration phenotype, while the others live a normal lifespan with no evidence of spontaneous tumor formation. Histological analysis reveals discrete examples of hyperplasia in the mammary epithelium, but most tissues appear normal while being accompanied by derepression of pRB regulated E2F targets. This suggests that non-E2F, pRB dependent pathways may have a more relevant role in proliferative control than previously identified.

PAX6 expression is maintained in a variety of cell types within each organ, although its role in each lineage and how it acquires cell-specific activity remain elusive. Herein, we aimed to determine the roles and the hierarchical organization of the PAX6-dependent gene regulatory network during the differentiation of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Somatic mutagenesis of Pax6 in the differentiating RPE revealed that PAX6 functions in a feed-forward regulatory loop with MITF during onset of melanogenesis. PAX6 both controls the expression of an RPE isoform of Mitf and synergizes with MITF to activate expression of genes involved in pigment biogenesis. This study exemplifies how one kernel gene pivotal in organ formation accomplishes a lineage-specific role during terminal differentiation of a single lineage.

Leukemic cells from both families exhibited 9p deletion, with loss-of-heterozygosity and retention of the mutant PAX5 allele at 9p13. Two additional sporadic ALL cases with 9p loss demonstrated PAX5 Gly183 substitution in the leukemic cells.

During adipocyte differentiation, SCD expression increases concomitantly with several transcription factors and lipogenic genes. We used microarrays to examine gene expression in differentiated pre-adipocytes treated with and without an SCD inhibitor. On day 7 of adipocyte differentiation, total RNA was extracted from adipocytes. Two conditions were selected for comparison: total RNA extracted from adipocytes treated with DMSO (control) and or a SCD inhibitor. .. total RNA;  Pre-adipocytes maintained in DMSO (control), replicate 1;  Pre-adipocytes maintained in DMSO (control), replicate 2;  Pre-adipocytes maintained in DMSO (control), replicate 3;  Pre-adipocytes maintained in DMSO (control), replicate 4;  Pre-adipocytes treated with SCD inhibitor (SDCinhib), replicate 1;  Pre-adipocytes treated with SCD inhibitor (SDCinhib), replicate 2;  Pre-adipocytes treated with SCD inhibitor (SDCinhib), replicate 3;  3T3-L1;  10090;  Mus musculus;  pre-adipocyte;  DMSO;  SCD inhibitor;  Throughout differentiation cells were treated with either 1 ?M of a commercially available SCD inhibitor or an equivalent volume of DMSO (control condition);

The order of evolutionary events for non-GCIMP GBM is 1) chr 7 gain and loss of chr 10, followed by 2) CDKN2A loss and/or TP53 mutation, and 3) alterations canonical for specific subtypes such as NF1 loss or focal amplification of PDGFR   or EGFR. We then developed a computational methodology to identify the drivers of broad copy number changes, identifying PDGF-A (chr 7) and PTEN (chr 10) as driving the initial non-disjunction events. These predictions were validated using mouse modeling, showing PDGF-A is sufficient to induce PN-like gliomas that are enhanced by loss of Ink4a-Arf, Tp53 or Pten. Additional Nf1 loss converts PN to the MES subtype. Our findings suggest non-GCIMP GBMs arise as, and evolve from, a common proneural-like precursor. hGBM_sphere:Three different human GBM sphere lines expressing two different NF1-shRNAs or empty shRNA-control were generated by a lentiviral infection with the relevant pLKO.1 vectors. The total RNAs were obtained from the GBM sphere lines and the gene expression profile of the NF1-shRNA cells was then compared to the control cells.hGBM_rapamycin:Two human GBM sphere lines (TS543 and TS667) expressing the NF1-shRNAs were generated by a lentiviral infection with two different pLKO.1-NF1-shRNA vectors (two different target sequence; #2 and #5). The total RNAs were obtained from the NF1-shRNA lines treated with a 1nM rapamycin or 0.1% DMSO control for 5 hours and the gene expression profile was then compared between the both groups.Murine_gliomas:Murine brain tumors were generated by an injection of DF1 cells producing the relevant RCAS virus into newborn pups or adult mice brain. When mice presented any symptoms of disease, the mice were sacrificed and the brain tumor tissues were macroscopically dissected. Then total RNAs were extracted from the murine brain tumors or normal brain tissues and the gene expression profile was compared between various tumor types and/or normal brain tissues. In this study, two different RCAS-shNf1 (GR249 and GF249) and shp53 (R696 and mR696) was used for the generation of the murine brain tumors. Each RCAS vector has different structure but the target sequence against the Nf1 and p53 is same and similar knockdown effect was observed. Tumor grade were determined with the residual sections after a piece of tumor tissue were excised for the RNA extraction. The detail information of the experiment was described in the associated-publication.Murine_shere:Murine neurosphere lines were generated by a retroviral infection with the relevant RCAS viruses. The total RNAs were obtained from the murine neurosphere lines expressing the RCAS-shGL2, shNf1, shp53 or shNf1+shp53 and the gene expression profiles of the shNf1, shp53 or shNf1/p53 cells were then compared to the control shGL2 cells. .. 11;

Steroid receptor coregulator-2 (SRC-2) belongs to the multifunctional SRC/p160 family which also includes SRC-1 and SRC-3.  Sharing strong sequence homology, all three SRCs exert diverse regulatory effects by modulating the transcriptional potency of nuclear receptor family members, including the estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR respectively).  Importantly, absence of SRC-2 in PR positive cells in the epithelial, stromal, and myometrial compartments of the murine uterus results in a striking infertility defect. This reproductive phenotype highlights a key role for SRC-2 in uterine function which is not shared with other coregulators. Intriguingly, abrogation of uterine SRC-2 does not block embryo apposition or attachment to the apical surface of luminal epithelial cells of the endometrium but rather prevents P4-dependent local decidualization of the sub-epithelial stroma.  Remarkably, epithelial-specific ablation of SRC-2 in the murine uterus does not compromise endometrial functionality, again underscoring the unique importance of stromal derived SRC-2 in uterine function. The stromal decidualization defect resulting from SRC-2 ablation is reflected at the molecular level by a marked attenuation in P4 responsive target genes known to be critical for P4 dependent decidualization (i.e. ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1, Follistatin and Fkbp5).  Conversely, the induction of E2 or P4 target genes involved in embryo implantation (i.e. leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh) respectively) is not affected by SRC-2   s absence.  As with mouse studies, decidualization of primary human stromal cells (HESCs) in culture is blocked by SRC-2 knockdown; however, HESC decidualization is unaffected by knockdown of SRC-1 or SRC-3.  As a consequence of SRC-2 knockdown, molecular studies disclose a striking decrease in the induction of a subset of P4 target genes (i.e. WNT4 and FKBP5) which are essential for the stromal-epithelioid transformation step, the cellular hallmark of endometrial decidualization.  Collectively, these studies not only showcase the evolutionary importance of SRC-2 in endometrial biology but also suggest that deregulation of this coregulator may underpin a spectrum of hormone-dependent uterine pathologies such as endometriosis and endometrial cancer. Microarray analysis was performed on mouse uteri using eighteen SRC-2flox/flox (SRC-2f/f) and eighteen PRCre/+ SRC-2flox/flox (SRC-2d/d) mice. Mice were ovariectomized at 6 weeks and after 2 weeks mice were either treated with sesame oil (vehicle) or 1 mg of P4.

We adapted microfluidic CTC capture to a tamoxifen-driven B-RAF/PTEN mouse melanoma model. CTCs were detected in all tumor-bearing mice, rapidly declining after B-RAF inhibitor treatment. CTCs were shed early from localized tumors and a short course of B-RAF inhibition following surgical resection was sufficient to dramatically suppress distant metastases. The large number of CTCs in melanoma-bearing mice enabled comparison of RNA sequencing profiles with the matched primary tumor. A mouse melanoma CTC-derived signature correlated with invasiveness and cellular motility in human melanoma. In patients with metastatic melanoma, CTCs were detected in smaller numbers in patients with metastatic melanoma and declined with successful B-RAF targeted therapy. Together, the capture of CTCs and their molecular characterization provide insight into the hematogenous spread of melanoma. We adapted a microfluidic platform, the HbCTC-Chip (Stott et al., 2010, Pubmed ID: 20930119), to capture melanoma CTCs derived from mouse tumors, using panels of antibodies against melanoma-specific cell surface markers, followed by staining for melanoma antigens and optimized on-chip fluorescent imaging. We used a tamoxifen inducible BRAF(CA/+)/PTEN(flox/flox) melanoma mouse model (Dankort et al., 2009, Pubmed ID: 19282848) derived from a C57BL/6 background. Such mice received focal subcutaneous injection of tamoxifen (Sigma) (50ul at 5mg/ml in 50% EtOH suspension) at the left flank at 6-7 weeks after birth. Blood samples were collected from five mice with high tumor burden following tamoxifen injection. Blood from each mouse was split and processed through the CTC-chips functionalized with anti-CSPG4/MCAM antibody and control IgGs, respectively. Matched primary (from the tamoxifen injection site) and metastatic (from upper or lower back) tumors were harvested from the same mouse and immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA extraction, single molecular sequencing and determination of Digital Gene Expression was as in Yu et al., 2012 (Pubmed ID: 22763454). One of the five mice yielded no CTC or IgG data. In addition, skin was taken from a sixth mouse, which was a complete wild type C57BL/6 mouse (without the BRAF/PTEN transgenes).The skin was taken after euthanasia of the animal and was processed as the tissue from the matched primary and metastatic tumors. ..

Methods: Recently developed FACS-based methods (Chen et al, PNAS, Liu et al, Blood, Hu et al Blood) were employed to purify morphologically and functionally discrete populations of cells, each representing specific stages of terminal erythroid differentiation. RNA was prepared from these cells and subjected to RNA-seq analyses. Results: There were vast temporal changes in gene expression across the differentiation stages, with each stage exhibiting unique transcriptomes.Clustering and network analyses revealed that differing stage-specific patterns of expression across differentiation were transcriptionally enriched for genes of differing function. Numerous differences were present between human and murine transcriptomes, with significant variation in the global patterns of gene expression. Conclusions: These data provide a significant resource for studies of normal and perturbed erythropoiesis, allowing a deeper understanding of mechanisms of erythroid development, differentiation, and inherited and acquired disease.

The transcription factor Spic is selectively expressed by RPM and is required for their development, but the physiologic stimulus inducing Spic is unknown. Here, we report that Spic also regulated the development of F4/80+VCAM+ bone marrow macrophages (BMM) and that Spic expression in BMM and RPM development was induced by heme, a metabolite of erythrocyte degradation. Pathologic hemolysis induced loss of RPM and BMM due to excess heme but induced Spic in monocytes to generate new RPM and BMM. Spic expression in monocytes was constitutively inhibited by the transcriptional repressor Bach1. Heme induced proteasome-dependent BACH1 degradation and rapid Spic derepression. Further, cysteine-proline dipeptide motifs in BACH1 that mediate heme-dependent degradation were necessary for Spic induction by heme. These findings are the first example of metabolite-driven differentiation of a tissue-resident macrophage subset and provide new insight into iron homeostasis.  Global gene expression pattern of bone marrow-derived macrophages generated with GM-CSF in vitro and treated with heme were compared to those treated with vehicle at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after treatment. GM-CSF cultures of Spic(igfp/igfp) BM cells were treated with heme (80   m) or vehicle after 6 days in culture. Adherent fraction of cells were harvested 6 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after treatment and RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and submitted for amplification, labeling and hybridization.

However, mutations that increase HSC proliferation tend to reduce competitiveness and self-renewal potential, raising the question of how a mutant HSC can sustainably outcompete wild-type HSCs. Activating mutations in NRAS are prevalent in human myeloproliferative disease and leukemia. Here we show that a single allele of oncogenic NrasG12D increases HSC proliferation but also increases reconstituting and self-renewal potential upon serial transplantation in irradiated mice, all without immortalizing HSCs or causing leukemia in our experiments. NrasG12D also confers long-term self-renewal potential upon multipotent progenitors. To explore the mechanism by which NrasG12D promotes HSC proliferation and self-renewal we assessed HSC cell cycle kinetics using H2B-GFP label retention. We found that NrasG12D had a bimodal effect on HSCs, increasing the proliferation of some HSCs while increasing the quiescence and competitiveness of other HSCs. One signal can therefore increase HSC proliferation, competitiveness, and self-renewal through a bimodal effect that promotes proliferation in some HSCs and quiescence in others. 12 RNA samples from mouse bone marrows were analyzed. There are three biological replicates for each subtype. ..

For microarray profiling, total RNA from E18.5 lungs was submitted for labeling and hybridization (Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Whole Genome Array, Affymetrix) to the Boston University Microarray Core facility. Clara cells (CCs) are a morphologically and operationally heterogeneous population of secretoglobin Scgb1a1-expressing secretory cells crucial for airway homeostasis and post-injury repair. Insights into the extent and origin of CC diversity have been hindered by the limited knowledge of markers of these cells and their precursors. To identify novel putative markers of CCs we characterized global changes in gene expression in embryonic lungs in which CCs were suppressed by conditional disruption of Notch signaling (Rbpjkcnull). Microarray profiling and Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR) identified eleven genes differentially downregulated in the E18.5 airways of Rbpjkcnull compared to controls, nearly half not previously known to mark CCs. Remarkably, in situ hybridization (ISH) revealed overlapping but also distinct domains of expression of these genes in E18.5 controls. Notably, Reg3g, Chad, Gabrp and Lrrc26 were selectively expressed in CCs of proximal airways and Upk3a expression was highly enriched in a CC subpopulation surrounding Neuroepithelial Bodies (NEBs). All genes expressed in the adult airways were found to be expressed in adult CCs and downregulated by selective CC ablation in a Naphthalene model of injury. Flow cytometry-based isolation of CCs from different airway regions of adult B1-EGFP reporter mice and qRT-PCR corroborated the spatial enrichment in gene expression observed by ISH. Remarkably, although, Scgb3a2, Upk3a, Cyp2f2, Cbr2, Krt15 could be detected unambiguously in airway progenitors as early as E14.5, only Scgb3a2 and Upk3a had their expression suppressed by disruption of Notch signaling, implicating both genes as the earliest markers for CC differentiation. Our study supports the idea that the diversification of the CC phenotype already arises during embryonic development and identifies candidate markers that can be used to investigate this process.

Here, we report the small RNA profile of Agodeficient  cells and determine Ago-dependent stability is a common feature of mammalian  miRNAs.

We investigated the effects of this polymorphism on circadian rhythmicity and sleep homeostasis by introducing the polymorphism into mice and assessing circadian and sleep parameters at baseline and during and after 12 h of sleep deprivation (SD). Microarray analysis was used to measure hypothalamic and cortical gene expression. Circadian behavior and sleep were normal at baseline. The response to SD of 2 electrophysiological markers of sleep homeostasis, electroencephalography (EEG)    power during wakefulness and    power during sleep, were greater in the Per35/5 mice. During recovery, the Per35/5 mice fully compensated for the SD-induced deficit in    power, but the Per34/4 and wild-type mice did not. Sleep homeostasis-related transcripts (e.g., Homer1, Ptgs2, and Kcna2) were differentially expressed between the humanized mice, but circadian clock genes were not.

They are affected in devastating lung diseases including COPD, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, and the major form (adenocarcinoma) of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths.  The alveolar epithelium is composed of two morphologically distinct cell types:  alveolar type (AT) 1 cells, exquisitely thin cells across which oxygen diffuses to reach the blood, and AT2 cells, specialized surfactant-secreting cells.  Classical studies suggested that AT1 cells arise from AT2 cells during development and following injury, but more recent studies suggest other sources.  Here we use histological and marker analysis, lineage tracing, and clonal analysis in mice to identify alveolar progenitor and stem cells and map their locations and potential in vivo.  The results show that AT1 and AT2 cells arise independently during development from a bipotential progenitor.  After birth, new AT1 cells derive from rare, long-lived, self-renewing AT2 cells, each producing a slowly expanding clonal focus of regenerated alveoli contiguous with the founder AT2 cell.  This stem cell function of AT2 cells is broadly activated by diffuse AT1 cell injury, and AT2 self-renewal can be induced in vitro by EGF ligands and permanently activated in vivo by AT2 cell-specific targeting of the oncogenic KrasG12D allele, efficiently transforming AT2 cells into monoclonal adenomatous tumors that rapidly enlarge and prove fatal.  Thus, there is a developmental switch in alveolar progenitor cells after birth, when mature AT2 cells function as facultative stem cells that contribute to local alveolar renewal, repair, and cancer.  We propose that short-range signals from dying AT1 cells regulate AT2 stem cell activity: a signal transduced by EGFR-KRAS controls AT2 self-renewal and is hijacked during oncogenic transformation, and a separate signal controls reprogramming to AT1 cell fate. To compare expression between ATII and E18 BP populations, RNA was isolated from either population purified by FACS.  Two populations are analyzed with 3 biological replicates per population. ..

However the mechanisms of its tumorigenic activity are poorly understood. We show here that Col6a3 is highly expressed in densely growing mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In MEFs where the TAF4 subunit of general transcription factor IID (TFIID) has been inactivated, elevated Col6a3 expression prevents contact inhibition promoting their 3 dimensional growth as foci and fibrospheres. Analyses of gene expression in densely growing Taf4-/- MEFs revealed repression of the Hippo pathway and activation of Wnt signalling. The Hippo activator Kibra/Wwc1 is repressed under dense conditions in Taf4-/- MEFs, leading to nuclear accumulation of the proliferation factor YAP1 in the cells forming 3D foci. At the same time, Wnt9a is activated and the Sfrp2 antagonist of Wnt signalling is repressed. Surprisingly, treatment of Taf4-/- MEFs with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) restores contact inhibition suppressing 3D growth. ATRA represses Col6a3 expression independently of TAF4 expression and Col6a3 silencing is sufficient to restore contact inhibition in Taf4-/- MEFs and to suppress 3D growth by reactivating Kibra expression to induce Hippo signalling and by inducing Sfrp2 expression to antagonize Wnt signalling. All together, these results reveal a critical role for Col6a3 in regulating both Hippo and Wnt signalling to promote 3D growth, and show that the TFIID subunit TAF4 is essential to restrain the growth promoting properties of Col6a3. Our data provide new insight into the role of extra cellular matrix components in regulating cell growth. 6 samples corresponding to non-confluent cells, confluent cells and cells growing as fibrospheres were analyzed.

Although some studies demonstrated that GATA1 is also required for mast cell differentiation, the effect of complete ablation of GATA1 in mast cell differentiation has not been examined. Here, by using tamoxifen-inducible conditional Gata1 knockout mice, we show that the role of GATA1 in mast cell differentiation is less than previously anticipated in adult mice. Although systemic administration of tamoxifen resulted in complete ablation of GATA1 protein in bone marrow and spleen, cell number and distribution of peripheral tissue mast cells in Gata1-null mice were comparable to those in wild type mice. Bone marrow cells derived from Gata1-null mice differentiated into mast cells that express both c-Kit and IgE receptor    subunit. Finally, we show a line of evidence that GATA1 and GATA2 cooperatively regulate the expression of several mast cell-specific genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. These results indicate that GATA1 is dispensable for differentiation and maintenance of mast cells in postnatal hematopoiesis and the loss of GATA1 function is likely compensated by GATA2. Murine bone marrow-derived mast cells from C57BL/6 mice were transfected with of control or GATA1 siRNA (200 pmol). Two samples were analyzed. Sample1 (ctrsi-mix) is prepared from cells transfected with control siRNA. Sample2 (G1si-mix) is prepared from cells transfected with GATA1 siRNA.

Although this minigene is present in the transgenes as a secondcistron, and thus not thought to be expressed, we found that three commonly used lines, Pdx1-CreLate, RIP-Cre, and MIP-GFP, each expressed significant amounts of hGH in pancreatic islets. Locally secreted hGH binds to prolactin receptors on    cells, activates STAT5 signaling, and induces pregnancy-like changes in gene expression, thereby augmenting pancreatic    cell mass and insulin content. In addition, islets of Pdx1-CreLate mice have lower GLUT2 expression and reduced glucose-induced insulin release and are protected against the    cell toxin streptozotocin. These findings may be important when interpreting results obtained when these and other hGH minigene-containing transgenic mice are used. Data obtained for the Pdx1-creLate and control samples were compaired to investigate the effect of hGH on the mRNA profile of islets. The data obtained from the islets of pregnant mice was added to the analysis to confirm the pregnacy-like phenotype in the Pdx1-creLate islets. The data of the different days of pregnancy was already described in Schraenen et al. 2010 (PMID: 20886204 and PMID: 20938637).

Global gene expression was evaluated using the oligonucleotide whole mouse genome microarrays and was validated with real-time PCR method. Exogenous IFN-   (1 ng/ml) increased myoblast proliferation, but decreased cell viability, the fusion index and the cellular content of myosin heavy chain, MyHC in C2C12 cultures on the 3rd day of differentiation. IFN-   up-regulated genes were mainly involved in biological processes such as: cell cycle, regulation of cell proliferation, programmed cell death, inflammatory, vasculature development, regulation of cytokine, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and chemotaxis, whereas down-regulated genes contributed mainly to: regulation of transcription, cell-cell signaling, nitrogen compound biosynthetic process, transmembrane receptor protein ser/thr protein kinase signaling pathway, and regulation of Wnt receptor signaling pathway.  IFN-   up-regulated the expression of cytokines/growth factors controlling cell proliferation (Cxcl10, Il15, Ccl2, Fgf7, Figf, Csf1, Vegfc, Hgf). Moreover, IFN-  : i) down-regulated genes encoding factors that are anabolic for muscle cells (Fst, Igf-1); ii) inhibited pro-myogenic transcription (via Mef2a, Nfkb1, and Pparg); iii) decreased expression of genes controlling cell adhesion and sarcolemma/cytoskeleton organization; and iv) activated the proteolytic pathways: proteasomes and catepsins, leading to protein degradation and impaired myotube growth.

We applied a high throughput study on the mouse models with aberrant TH levels on gestation day (GD) 16, before the onset of fetal thyroid function. Although 3 day treatment with methimazole (MMI) and perchlorate significantly decreased TH levels in fetal cerebral cortex, few changes in the abundance of mRNA were revealed by the microarray analysis. Injection TH to dams 12 hours before sacrifice on GD 16 induced 161 genes significantly changed in fetal cortex. Nine out of 10 selected genes were confirmed with RT-PCR, including known TH responsive gene Klf9 and other novel TH responsive genes such as Appbp2, Ppap2b and Fgfr1op2. TH regulation of the expression of these genes was also confirmed with cultured N2a   cells. Thyroid responsive elements (TREs) in the promoters of these genes were identified using electrophoresis mobility shift assay. TH effect on microRNA (miRNA) expression in developing cortex on GD 16 and postnatal day (PND) 15 was investigated with microarray and RT-PCR. Some of  miRNAs and precursors decreased in fetal cortex from the dams injected with TH on GD 16, including miR-16 and miR-106. Using 3    untranslate region reporter vector, we identified Klf9 is one of the target genes of miR-106, while Ppap2b is the target of miR-16. These results indicated that TH regulation on gene expression could through TR-TRE interaction and through regulating target miRNA expression. This study is the first report to identify TH responsive genes and miRNAs genome wide in the early fetal brain; it provides evidence to further understand the mechanism of TH effect on brain development. Timed-pregnant C57BL/6 mice (n=20; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) arrived on gestational day (GD) 11 and were housed individually in plastic cages under a 12:12 light cycle (0600 h   1800 h) with food available ad libitum. Mice were divided randomly into one of 4 groups (control, hypo, hypo+ and hyper; 5 per group) . Mice in the control and hyper groups were provided with fresh drinking water containing 2% sucrose from GD 13 to GD 16 until sacrifice. Mice in hypo and hypo+ were provided with fresh drinking water daily containing 1% Perchlorate (Per) and 0.025% Methimazole (MMI) supplemented with 2% sucrose (to mask bitterness) from GD 13 to sacrifice on GD 16. Twelve hours prior to sacrifice on GD 16 all mice received a single subcutaneous injection. Control and hypo mice received vehicle (0.9% saline in 100   l volume); the hypo+ group received 25.0   g/100g body weight thyroxine (T4) with 2.5   g/100g body weight T3 to restore a physiological level of TH; the hyper group received 100.0   g/100g body weight T4 with 10.0   g/100g body weight T3 to model hyperthyroidism. Dams were killed by exposure to CO2. Fetuses were dissected from the uterine horn and embryonic membranes then frozen on pulverized dry ice. Tissue samples were taken from the fetuses to determine sex using PCR for SRY (Yang J and RT Zoeller, 2002). Fetal cerebral cortices were removed from each mouse and used for microarray and RT-PCR analysis.Total RNA was extracted from half cortices of individual female fetuses using RNeasy Lipid tissue Mini kits (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  The quality of total RNA was evaluated by A260/A280 ratio (found to be at least 1.8 for each sample) and by electrophoresis on the Agilent Bioanalyzer.

The mechanisms that maintain these progenitor-like characteristics are poorly understood. We report that the transcription factor Zfx is required for the development and propagation of experimental AML caused by MLL-AF9 fusion, and of T-ALL caused by Notch1 activation. In both leukemia types, Zfx activated progenitor-associated gene expression programs and prevented differentiation. Key Zfx target genes included mitochondrial enzymes Ptpmt1 and Idh2, whose overexpression partially rescued the propagation of Zfx-deficient AML. These studies identify a common mechanism that controls the cell-of-origin characteristics of acute leukemias derived from disparate lineages and transformation mechanisms. Independent primary Notch induced T-ALL cell lines were created by retroviral transduction of Notch-IC into hematopoietic progenitors carrying the tamoxifen inducible Cre-ER transgene and the Zfx conditional (Zfx fl/y) allele (lines 14843, 14844, 14846).  T-ALL cells generated from each line were isolated from moribund mice and transplanted into sublethally irradiated secondary recipients. Ten days after transplant when T-ALL cells had appeared in the blood of the secondary recipients, they were treated by gavage with either Vehicle or Tamoxifen (5 mg /day for three days) to induce Zfx deletion in leukemia cells.  48 hours after the final Tamoxifen treatment, the mice were sacrificed and T-ALL cells were recovered by FACS for microarray studies. .. 14843;  14844;  14846;  Notch induced T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL);  ZFX flox;  ZFX null;  total RNA;  Sorted GFP+ T-ALL from Tamoxifen treated mouse;  Sorted GFP+ T-ALL from Vehicle treated mouse;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Leukemia cells were treated with Tamoxifen as they expanded in murine hosts in-vivo.

Here we show that Mll2, one of the six Set1/Trithorax-type H3K4 methyltransferases in mammals, is required for trimethylation of bivalent promoters in mouse embryonic stem cells. Mll2 is bound to bivalent promoters but also to most active promoters, which do not require Mll2 for H3K4me3 or mRNA expression. In contrast, the Set1 complex (Set1C) subunit Cxxc1 is primarily bound to active but not bivalent promoters. This indicates that bivalent promoters rely on Mll2 for H3K4me3 whereas active promoters have more than one bound H3K4 methyltransferase including Set1C. Removal of Mll1, sister to Mll2, had almost no effect on any promoter unless Mll2 was also removed indicating functional back-up between these enzymes. Except for a subset, loss of H3K4me3 on bivalent promoters did not prevent responsiveness to retinoic acid thereby arguing against a priming model for bivalency. In contrast, we propose that Mll2 is the pioneer trimethyltransferase for promoter definition in the na  ve epigenome and Polycomb-Group action on bivalent promoters blocks premature establishment of active, Set1C bound, promoters.

It controls compartmentalized gene expression, allowing the liver to ensure its essential metabolic function. It is activated by mutations in 20 to 40% of hepatocellular carcinomas with specific metabolic features. We decipher the molecular determinants of   -catenin-dependent zonal transcription using mice with   -catenin-activated or -inactivated hepatocytes, characterizing in vivo their chromatin occupancy by Tcf4 and   -catenin, their transcriptome and their metabolome. We find that Tcf4 DNA-bindings depend on   -catenin. Tcf4/  -catenin binds Wnt-responsive elements preferentially around   -catenin-induced genes. In contrast, genes repressed by   -catenin bind Tcf4 on Hnf4-responsive elements.   -catenin, Tcf4 and Hnf4   interact, dictating   -catenin transcription which is antagonistic to that elicited by Hnf4  . Finally, we find the drug/bile metabolism pathway to be the one most heavily targeted by   -catenin, partly through xenobiotic nuclear receptors. We conclude that   -catenin patterns the zonal liver together with Tcf4, Hnf4   and xenobiotic nuclear receptors. This network represses lipid metabolism, and exacerbates glutamine, drug and bile metabolism, mirroring hepatocellular carcinomas with   -catenin mutational activation.

Here we show that Tet1 and Tet2 have distinct roles in regulating 5hmC deposition and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). Tet1 depletion in mESC primarily diminishes 5hmC levels at transcription start sites (TSS), whereas Tet2 depletion is mostly associated with decreased 5hmC in gene bodies relative to TSS. 5hmC is enriched at exon start and end sites, especially in exons that are highly expressed, and is significantly decreased upon Tet2 knockdown at the boundaries of high-expressed exons that are selectively regulated by Tet2. In differentiating murine B cells, Tet2 deficiency is associated with selective exon exclusion in the gene encoding the transmembrane phosphatase CD45. Tet2 depletion is associated with increased 5hmC and decreased 5mC at promoters/ TSS regions, possibly because of the redundant activity of Tet1. Together, these data indicate a complex interplay between Tet1 and Tet2 in mESC, and show that loss-of-function of a single TET protein does not necessarily lead to loss of 5hmC and a corresponding gain of 5mC, as generally assumed. The relation between Tet2 loss-of-function and selective changes in exon expression could potentially explain the frequent occurrence of both TET2 loss-of-function mutations and mutations in proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing in myeloid malignancies in humans.

Marked mitochondrial derangements were observed in hearts of PGC-1a/b-deficient mice during the postnatal period, including fragmentation and elongation associated with the development of a lethal cardiomyopathy. The expression of multiple genes involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission was downregulated in hearts of PGC-1a/b-deficient mice. PGC-la was shown to activate transcription of the mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) gene by coactivating the estrogen-related receptor a (ERRa) upon a highly conserved element.  Surprisingly, PGC-1a/b deficiency did not alter cardiac function or general mitochondrial density and myocyte distribution in adult heart. However, transcriptional profiling and mitochondrial function studies demonstrated that the PGC-1 coactivators are required for full respiratory capacity and high level expression of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded genes involved in mitochondrial energy transduction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in adult heart. These results unveil distinct developmental stage-specific transcriptional programs involved in the maturation and maintenance of mitochondria. RNA from five PGC-1a-/- and five PGC-1a-/-bf/f/MerCre mice was analyzed. ..

[mouse]|The ets transcription factor ELF5 specifies the differentiation of mammary progenitor cells to establish the milk-secreting lineage. ER- and poor prognosis basal breast cancers arise from this progenitor cell and these cancers express high levels of Elf5. Knockdown of ELF5 expression in basal breast cancer cell lines, or forced expression in luminal breast cancer cell lines, resulted in reduced cell proliferation. Transcript profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that the transcriptional activity of ELF5 specified the gene expression patterns that distinguish basal from luminal breast cancer, including suppression of FOXA1, GATA3 and ER, key estrogen-action genes. Tamoxifen treatment of luminal MCF7 cells upregulated Elf5 expression and cells that acquired resistance to Tamoxifen became dependent on ELF5 for proliferation. ELF5 is a regulator of breast cancer cell proliferation, transcriptionally specifies the basal molecular subtype and is utilised by ER+ breast cancer cells to escape proliferative arrest caused by Tamoxifen.

Current capture methods lack sufficient spatial resolution to isolate mRNA from individual in vivo resident cells without damaging adjacent tissue. Because of this limitation, it has been difficult to assess the influence of the microenvironment on the transcriptome of individual neurons. Here, we engineered a Transcriptome In Vivo Analysis (TIVA)-tag, which upon photoactivation enables mRNA capture from single cells in live tissue. Using the TIVA-tag in combination with RNA-seq to analyze transcriptome variance among single dispersed cells and in vivo resident mouse and human neurons, we show that the tissue microenvironment shapes the transcriptomic landscape of individual cells. The TIVA methodology provides the first noninvasive approach for capturing mRNA from single cells in their natural microenvironment.

Although evidence of a crosstalk between H3K9 and H3K27 methylations has started to emerge, their actual interplay remains elusive.

Moreover, combining different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that Ezh2 and G9a/GLP share an important number of common genomic targets, encoding developmental and neuronal regulators. Furthermore, we show that G9a enzymatic activity modulates PRC2 genomic recruitment to a subset of its target genes.

To determine if Gata4 and Gata6 are redundant or have non-overlapping roles, we performed cardiomyocyte-specific conditional gene deletions for Gata4 and Gata6 in conjunction with reciprocal replacement with a transgene encoding either Gata4 or Gata6, during the pressure overload response.  We determined that Gata4 and Gata6 play a redundant and dosage-sensitive role in programming the hypertrophic growth response itself following pressure overload stimulation. However, non-redundant functions were identified as functional decompensation induced by either Gata4 or Gata6 deletion was not rescued by the reciprocal transgene, and only Gata4 heart-specific deletion produced a reduction in capillary density after pressure overload.  Gene expression profiling from hearts of these gene-deleted mice showed both overlapping and unique transcriptional codes, with Gata4 exhibiting the strongest impact. These results indicate that Gata4 and Gata6 play a dosage-dependent and semi-redundant role in programming cardiac hypertrophy, but that each has a unique role in maintaining cardiac homeostasis and adaptation to injury that cannot be compensated by the other. Microarray-bassed gene expression profiling identified overlapping, distinct, and quantitatively/differentially regulated classes of Gata4 or Gata6 regulated genes.

Previously, we have generated Med1 conditional null mice, where a critical subunit of Mediator, Med1, is removed from keratinocytes. Here we present evidence that ablation of Med1 accelerated epidermal regeneration after injury. As bulge keratinocyte stem cells are important contributors to regenerate epidermis, we first analyzed properties of stem cells in Med1 null mice. BrdU long retaining analysis revealed that deletion of Med1 still maintained quiescence of bulge keratinocyte stem cells, despite of general hyperplasia observed in Med1 deficient keratinocytes. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that a series of niche matrix proteins decreased in Med1 deficient keratinocytes. In contrast, the expression of stem cell marker Sox9 was not altered, suggesting stem cells are present but activated because of abnormal niche surrounding stem cells. In addition, Med1 deletion suppressed injury induced inflammatory reaction, which indirectly regulates epidermal regeneration.  We also indicated that TGF  1 significantly decreased in both bulge and epidermal keratinocytes upon Med1 deletion. Our study demonstrates that coactivator Med1 has a critical role to maintain bulge stem cells and epidermal regeneration presumably through regulation in TGF   signaling. n=3 WT and KO (each sample contain RNA isolated from wounded or nonwounded skins excised from 3 mice) .. 8 wks;  Med1 KO; MED1 fl/fl K14 driven Cre;  control WT; MED1 fl/fl;  telogen;  total RNA;  non-wounded;  wounded;  KO_non-wounded_skin;  KO_wounded_skin;  WT_non-wounded_skin;  WT_wounded_skin;  C57BL6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  24 hr;  skin;  Med1 KO mice and their littermate control mice received two full-thickness wounds with a 6-mm biopsy punch on the telogen skin.

Suprisingly, expression of TLR-assoociated signaling proteins were found to be present at equivalent levels between mDC and pDC, despite differential expression of TLRs, and thus revealing insight into use of adaptor proteins that function as general regulators of TLR signaling pathways in both cell types. mDC and pDC were sorted from spleens of mice in 2 independent experiments: The first experiment included 2 replicates of pDC that were cultured in medium for 1h prior to RNA extraction and 1 replicate of mDC that were directly processed for RNA extraction after the sort.

Although these RNAs are responsible for the formation and maintenance of heterochromatin, little is known about how their transcription is regulated. Here we show that the Snail1 transcription factor represses pericentromeric transcription, acting through the H3K4 deaminase LOXL2. Since Snail1 plays a key role in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), we analyzed the regulation of mouse heterochromatin transcription in this process. At the onset of EMT, one of the major structural heterochromatin proteins, HP1a, is transiently released from heterochromatin foci in a Snail1/LOXL2   dependent manner during EMT, concomitantly with a down-regulation of major satellite transcription. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that ectopic expression of heterochromatin transcripts affects the transcription profile of EMT-related genes. Additionally, preventing the down-regulation of major satellite transcripts compromised the migratory and invasive behavior of mesenchymal cells. We propose that Snail1 regulates heterochromatin transcription through the histone-modifying enzyme, LOXL2, thus creating the favorable transcriptional state necessary for completing EMT.

Gata2 gene ablation was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis in the PR-cre; Gata2fl/fl (termed Gata2d/d) uterus. While littermate controls are fertile, Gata2d/d females are completely infertile. Analysis of the infertility indicates that implantation does not occur, and the uterine stroma is incapable of undergoing the decidual reaction to support further embryonic development. Measure of P4 target genes including PR itself indicate a block in P4 target gene induction and that Gata2 regulates PR expression directly. Microarray analysis demonstrates that ablation of Gata2 leads to specific gene changes, including disruption of the Wnt signaling pathway, Progesterone receptor (PR) signaling, and Ihh signaling pathway. In addition we identified 46,183 GATA2 binding sites in P4 treatment conditions with 7,954 binding sites overlapping that of the PR.Taken together, these data demonstrate that Gata2 is a critical regulator of gene expression and function in the murine uterus. .. 8 weeks old;  female;  GATA2 d/d;  total RNA;  GATA2dd_Oil;  GATA2dd_P4;  mixed background;  10090;  Mus musculus;  ovariectomized uterus;

When removed from the embryonic gonad, PGCs can give rise to embryonic germ cell lines (EGs), pluripotent stem cells that display most of the characteristics of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) including the ability to form teratomas and to contribute to chimera formation. In mice, EG cells can be derived between E8.5 up to E12.5 of embryonic development, at which point the PGCs undergo sexual differentiation and in the male transition into unipotent gonocytes. Dazl, a germ cell-specific RNA-binding protein, is specifically expressed in developing PGCs and is required for proper germ cell development. Dazl knockout mice are infertile, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotype are still unknown. Here we demonstrate that Dazl localizes in granular structures in mammalian PGCs but not in ESCs. We demonstrate Dazl plays a central role in a large mRNA/protein interactive network that includes members of Fragile-X family RNA-binding proteins. We demonstrate that Dazl and Fxr1 play a central role in these granules and directly regulate the translation of specific core pluripotency factors, including Sox2 and Suz12.

Current models used for safety assessment in drug development and chemical risk assessment do not accurately predict steatosis in humans. Therefore, new models need to be developed to screen compounds for steatogenic properties. We have studied the usefulness of mouse precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) as an alternative to animal testing to gain more insight into the mechanisms involved in the steatogenesis. To this end, PCLS were incubated 24h with the model steatogenic compounds, amiodarone (AMI), valproic acid (VA), and tetracycline (TET). Transcriptome analysis using DNA microarrays was used to identify genes and processes affected by these compounds. AMI and VA upregulated lipid metabolism, whereas processes associated with extracellular matrix remodelling and inflammation were downregulated. TET downregulated mitochondrial functions, lipid metabolism, and fibrosis. From the transcriptomics data it was hypothesized that all 3 compounds affect peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor (PPAR) signalling. Application of PPAR reporter assays classified AMI and VA as PPAR   and triple PPAR  / (  /  )/   agonist, respectively, whereas TET had no effect on any of the PPARs. Some of the differentially expressed genes were considered as potential candidate biomarkers to identify PPAR agonists (i.e. AMI and VA) or compounds impairing mitochondrial functions (i.e. TET). Finally, comparison of our findings with publicly available transcriptomics data showed that a number of processes altered in the mouse PCLS was also affected in mouse livers and human primary hepatocytes exposed to known PPAR agonists. Thus mouse PCLS are a valuable model to identify mechanisms of action of compounds altering lipid metabolism. Two sets of candidate biomarkers could be used to screen compounds interfering with lipid metabolism by different mechanisms. Necrotic compounds exposures Mouse precision cut liver slices (PCLS) were prepared from livers obtained from 5 different C57BL/6 male mice (24 weeks old). PCLS were cultured for 24 hours at 80% of oxygen; 5% CO2 and the remaining gas volume was filled up to 95% with N2. PCLS were exposed to model steatogenic, cholestatic, and necrotic compounds selected based on published reports. As steatogenic model compounds amiodarone (AMI), valproic acid (VA), and tetracycline (TET) were selected. As model cholestatic compounds cyclosporin A (CsA), chlorpromazine (CPZ), and ethinyl estradiol (EE) were applied. As necrotic compounds acetaminophen (APAP), isoniazid (ISND), and paraquat (PQ) were applied. To select a non-toxic dose eventually to be used for exposure experiments and subsequent gene expression profiling experiments, the following concentrations ranges were tested: AMI 0-100   M,   VA 0-500   M, TET 0-100   M , CsA 0-100   M,  CPZ 0-80   M,  EE 0-100   M,  PQ 0-10   M,  APAP 0-3000   M and ISND 0-1000   M. CsA, CPZ, AMI, PQ, EE were dissolved in DMSO, VA and TET were dissolved in ethanol (EtOH), and ISND was dissolved in PBS. The compounds were added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 0.1% vol/vol in an appropriate solvent (DMSO, EtOH, or PBS). Slices incubated with the solvents at 0.1% vol/vol served as controls. The viability of the slices was assessed by measuring the ATP content normalized on protein.   Dose selection for the three steatogenic, cholestatic, and necrotic exposures were performed in 5 independent experiments with slices obtained from 5 mice.  Concentrations that did not cause a decrease of the ATP level normalized on protein, compared to controls, were selected. For transcriptome analysis, PCLS were cultured at the same conditions as described above. The selected concentrations for steatogenic, cholestatic, and necrotic drugs were tested again in liver slices obtained from 5 different mice to re-confirm that the selected concentrations for the exposure experiments were not toxic.

PCLS were cultured for 24 hours at 80% of oxygen; 5% CO2 and the remaining gas volume was filled up to 95% with N2. PCLS were exposed to model necrotic compounds selected based on published reports. As necrotic model compounds acetaminophen (APAP), isoniazid (ISND) , and paraquat (PQ)  were selected. To select a non-toxic dose eventually to be used for exposure experiments and subsequent gene expression profiling experiments, the following concentrations ranges were tested: PQ 0-10 ?M,  APAP 0-3000 ?M and ISND 0-1000 ?M. APAP and PQ were dissolved in DMSO, and ISND was dissolved in PBS. The compounds were added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 0.1% vol/vol in an appropriate solvent (DMSO or PBS). Slices incubated with the solvents at 0.1% vol/vol served as controls. The viability of the slices was assessed by measuring the ATP content normalized on protein.   Dose selection for the three necrotic exposures were performed in five independent experiments with slices obtained from five mice.  Concentrations that did not cause a decrease of the level of ATP normalized on protein compared to controls were selected. The concentrations used in the exposure experiments were as follows: 1000 ?M APAP, 1000 ?M ISND, and 5 ?M PQ.;

The results of a study that aimed to understand the mechanisms of this effect are presented here. A gene expression profile analysis indicated that genes regulated by taurine have roles in proliferation, cellular adhesion, cell survival, and mitochondrial functioning. Together with additional functional analyses, the results suggest that taurine provides more favorable conditions for cell proliferation by improving mitochondrial functioning. The total RNA from the control and taurine NPC cultures was used to produce tagged complementary DNA (cDNA) probes. Hybridation analysis used the mouse 65-mer oligo library from Sigma-Genosys to compare the expression of 23,232 gene-specific oligonucleotide probes for mouse. ..

In order to obtain a homogenous population of neuronal precursor cells and to streamline the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we assessed PSA-NCAM, a surface glycoprotein that is specifically expressed on immature neurons. We developed an optimized strategy for magnetic isolation of PSA-NCAM positive neuronal precursors from differentiated ESC cultures and characterized their neuronal differentiation potential in vitro. PSA-NCAM enrichment at an early step of neural differentiation increased the number of ES cell derived neurons and reduced cellular diversity. Gene expression analysis revealed that mainly genes involved in neuronal activity were over-represented after purification. The in vivo potential of in vitro derived PSA-NCAM+ enriched precursors was functionally characterized by grafting into the forebrain of adult mice. Analysis for several neuronal and glia markers at 10 or 40 days post graft showed a distinct differentiation pattern. While unsorted control cells gave rise to a mixed population composed of immature precursors, early postmitotic neurons or glial cells, the majority of PSA-NCAM+ enriched cells differentiated into NeuN positive neurons. Furthermore, when in contact with the rostral migratory stream, higher numbers of cells integrated into the stream and migrated towards the olfactory bulb when the PSA-NCAM enriched population was grafted. Thus, enrichment of neuronal precursors based on PSA-NCAM expression represents a general and straightforward approach to narrow cellular heterogeneity during neuronal differentiation of pluripotent cells.

The column was rinsed three times with 0.5 ml of medium. Magnetically isolated PSA-NCAM positive cells were retained in the column and eluted as the positively selected cell fraction after removing the column from the magnet. Immunomagnetic removal of dead cells prior enrichment with anti-PSA-NCAM was performed using the Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi Biotec).  Isolated in vitro derived PSA-NCAM positive cells were seeded on polyornithine and laminin coated 24-well plates and further differentiated into neuronal lineage as describe above for in vitro analysis or were collected in medium at a concentration of 50000/ul and used for transplantation.;

In addition, mechanical loading, which estrogen signaling may intersect with the Wnt/  -catenin pathway, is also essential for bone health. As osteocytes are known as the major mechanosensory cells embedded in mineralized bone matrix, osteocyte ER   deletion mice (ER    Ocy/  Ocy) were generated by mating ER   floxed mice with Dmp1-Cre mice to determine functions of ER   in osteocytes. Trabecular bone mineral density of female, but not male ER    Ocy/  Ocy mice was significantly decreased. Bone formation parameters in ER    Ocy/  Ocy were significantly decreased while osteoclast parameters were unchanged. This suggests that ER   in osteocytes exerts osteoprotective function by positively controlling bone formation. To identify potential targets of ER  , gene array analysis of Dmp1-GFP osteocytes FACS sorted from ER    Ocy/  Ocy and control mice was performed. Expression of Mdk and Sostdc1, both known inhibitors of Wnt, were significantly increased without alteration of the mature osteocyte marker Sost or   -catenin. Hindlimb unloading exacerbated the trabecular bone loss, but surprisingly cortical bone was resistant. These studies show that ER   in osteocytes has osteoprotective effects in trabecular bone through regulating expression of Wnt antagonists, but conversely plays a negative role in cortical bone loss due to unloading. Wild type and osteocyte-specific Estrogen Receptor alpha knock-out mice were generated. The number of both genotypes of mice was three.

This in vitro system nicely recapitulates c-Myc-induced apoptosis, as activated MycERT2 induces strong p53-dependent apoptosis in response to serum starvation. Enforced miR-92 expression in three independent R26MER/MER MEF lines significantly enhanced Myc-induced apoptosis. We used microarrays to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying miR-92 functions. Three independent R26MER/MER MEF lines were infected by MSCV vector alone or by MSCV vector encoding miR-92.

Recent studies revealed that chromosomes are organized into megabase-scale domains that demarcate active and inactive genetic elements, suggesting that compartmentalization is important for genome function. Here we show that very specific long-range interactions are anchored by cohesin/CTCF sites, but not cohesin-only or CTCF-only sites, to form a hierarchy of chromosomal loops. These loops demarcate topological domains and form intricate internal structures within them. Post-mitotic nuclei deficient for functional cohesin exhibit global architectural changes associated with loss of cohesin/CTCF contacts and relaxation of topological domains. Transcriptional analysis shows that this cohesin-dependent perturbation of domain organization leads to widespread gene deregulation of both cohesin-bound and non-bound genes. Our data thereby support a role for cohesin in the global organization of domain structure and suggest that domains function to stabilize the transcriptional programs within them.

Here we report a novel physiological function of TNF that extends its effect beyond the host into the developing offspring.  A partial/complete maternal TNF-deficit, specifically in hematopoietic cells, resulted in reduced milk levels of chemokines IP-10, MCP-1/-3/-5, and MIP-1  , which in turn, augmented offspring postnatal hippocampal proliferation, leading to improved adult spatial memory.  These effects were reproduced by the postpartum administration of a clinically used anti-TNF agent.  Chemokines, fed to suckling pups of TNF-deficient mothers, restored both postnatal proliferation and adult spatial memory to normal levels.  This work identifies a TNF-dependent    lactrocrine    pathway that programs offspring hippocampal development and memory.  The level of ambient TNF is known to be downregulated by physical activity/exercise and adaptive stress; thus, we propose that the maternal TNF-milk chemokine pathway evolved to promote offspring adaptation to post-weaning environmental challenges/competition.

We also compared the transcriptional profile of Rasless cells with those of BRAF and MEK1-transfected Rasless cells which recovered proliferative ability.

Unexpectedly, we found that mice deficient in miR-126 have a major impairment in their innate response to pathogen-associated nucleic acids, as well as HIV, which results in more widespread cell infection. Further examination revealed that this was due to miR-126 control of plasmacytoid DC (pDC) homeostasis and function, and that miR-126 regulates expression of TLR7, TLR9, NFkB1 and other innate response genes, as well as VEGF-receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Deletion of VEGFR2 on DCs resulted in reduced interferon production, supporting a role for VEGFR2 in miR-126 regulation of pDCs. These studies identify the miR-126/VEGFR2 axis as an important regulator of the innate response that operates through multiscale control of pDCs. Plasmactyoid dendritic cells were FACS-sorted from spleens from wildtype and miR-126 KO mice and their RNA extracted.

However, identification of the components of this signaling pathway and of the NF-  B transcription factors that regulate wasting is far from complete.  In muscles of C26 tumor bearing mice, overexpression of d.n. IKK   blocked muscle wasting by 69%, the I  B  -super repressor blocked wasting by 41%.  In contrast, overexpression of d.n. IKK   or d.n. NIK did not block C26-induced wasting.  Surprisingly, overexpression of d.n. p65 or d.n. c-Rel did not significantly block muscle wasting.  Genome-wide mRNA expression arrays showed upregulation of many genes previously implicated in muscle atrophy.  To test if these upregulated genes were direct targets of NF-  B transcription factors, we compared genome-wide p65 or p50 binding to DNA in control and cachectic muscle using ChIP-sequencing.  Bioinformatic analysis of ChIP-seq data from control and C26 muscles showed increased p65 and p50 binding to a few regulatory and structural genes but only two of these genes were upregulated with atrophy.  The p65 and p50 ChIP-seq data are consistent with our finding of no significant change in protein binding to an NF-  B oligo in a gel shift assay.  Taken together, these data support the idea that although inhibition of I  B  , and particularly IKK  , blocks cancer-induced wasting, the alternative NF-  B signaling pathway is not required.  In addition, the downstream NF-  B transcription factors do not regulate the transcriptional changes.  These data are consistent with the growing body of literature showing that there are NF-  B-independent substrates of IKK   and I  B   that regulate physiological processes. To compare gene expression changes in atrophied muscles from C26 tumor bearing mice, gastrocnemius/plantaris muscles were harvested from 4 C26 tumor-bearing mice, and 3 control non tumor-bearing mice.  Total RNA were isolated and pooled (2-3 muslces in the same group per RNA sample ) to make equal amount of total RNA per sample. Three pooled total RNA samples from healthy control muscles and 3 pooled total RNA from muscles of C26 tumor bearing mice were labelled and hybridized on 6 Mouse Affyemtrix Gene 1.0 ST arrays.

In this study, we report on hypothalamic gene expression profile of a cancer cachectic mouse model with increased food intake. In this model, mice bearing C26 colon adenocarcinoma have an increased food intake subsequently to the loss of body weight. We hypothesize that in this model, appetite regulating systems in the hypothalamus, which apparently fail in anorexia, are still able to adapt adequately to changes in energy balance. Therefore studying the changes that occur on appetite regulators in the hypothalamus might reveal targets for treatment of cancer-induced eating disorders. By applying transcriptomics, many appetite regulating systems in the hypothalamus could be taken into account, providing an overview of changes that occur in the hypothalamus during tumour growth. We show that hypothalamic expression of orexigenic neuropeptides NPY and AgRP was higher, whereas expression of anorexigenic genes CCK and POMC were lower in TB compared to controls. In addition, serotonin and dopamine signalling pathways were found to be significantly altered in TB mice. Serotonin levels in brain showed to be lower in TB mice compared to control mice, while dopamine levels did not change. Moreover, serotonin levels inversely correlated with food intake. Transcriptomic analysis of the hypothalamus of cachectic TB mice with an increased food intake showed changes in NPY, AgRP and serotonin signalling. Serotonin levels in the brain showed to correlate with changes in food intake. Targeting these systems seems a promising strategy to avoid the development of cancer-induced eating disorders. C26-colon adenocarcinoma cells were subcutaneously inoculated in CDF1 mice. After 20 days, hypothalami were dissected and subjected to gene expression profiling.

To study the role of BMPs in wound-induced epidermal repair, we used transgenic mice overexpressing the BMP downstream component Smad1 under the control of a K14 promoter as an in vivo model, as well as ex vivo and in vitro assays. K14-caSmad1 mice exhibited retarded wound healing associated with significant inhibition of proliferation and increased apoptosis in healing wound epithelium. Furthermore, microarray and qRT-PCR analyses revealed decreased expression of a number of cytoskeletal/cell motility-associated genes including wound-associated keratins (Krt16, Krt17) and Myo5a, in the epidermis of K14- caSmad1 mice versus wild-type controls during wound healing. BMP treatment significantly inhibited keratinocyte migration ex vivo, and primary keratinocytes of K14-caSmad1 mice showed retarded migration compared to wild-type controls. Finally, siRNA-mediated silencing of Bmpr-1B in primary mouse keratinocytes accelerated cell migration and was associated with increased expression of Krt16, Krt17 and Myo5a compared to controls. Thus, this study demonstrates that BMPs inhibit keratinocyte proliferation, cytoskeletal organization and migration in regenerating skin epithelium during wound healing, and raises a possibility for using BMP antagonists for the management of chronic wounds.

Since the first generation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, extrinsic regulation of pluripotency has been at the focus of attention. Here we show that suppression of transforming growth factor    (TGF  ) signaling could have impressive effects on self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse ES cells. We introduce a chemically defined medium with inhibitors of TGF   and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase, designated here as R2i (Royan 2 inhibitors), for highly efficient establishment of ES cell lines from various mouse strains. R2i also supports homogenous expression of Nanog and Dppa3 proteins in ES cells and shows minimal differentiation leakage. Our results uncover an appropriate condition for ES cell generation from single blastomeres of various cleavage-stage embryos. Further, the high accuracy of genome integrity after long-term cultivation in R2i illustrates an optimal condition for ES cell culture. Global transcriptomic analysis of R2i cells demonstrates that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) signaling becomes overrepresented pursuant to TGF   repression, which may confer further robustness to pluripotency through shielding cells from differentiation stimuli. These findings point to a new facet of ground state pluripotency by blocking differentiation pathways, without influencing the pluripotency regulatory circuitry of mouse ES cells.

CTCF acts as a multifunctional regulator of transcription, having been previously associated with activator, repressor, and insulator activity. These diverse regulatory functions are crucial for preimplantation development and are implicated in the regulation of numerous lineage-specific genes.  Despite playing a critical role in  developmental gene regulation, the mechanisms that underlie developmental changes in CTCF recruitment and function are poorly understood. Our previous work suggested that differences in CTCF   s binding site sequence may affect the regulation of CTCF recruitment, as well as CTCF   s regulatory function. To investigate these two possibilities directly during a developmental process, changes in genome-wide CTCF binding and gene expression were characterized during in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. CTCF binding sites were initially separated into three classes (named LowOc, MedOc, and HighOc) based on similarity to the consensus motif.  The LowOc class, with lower-similarity to the consensus motif, is more likely to show changes in binding during differentiation.  These more dynamically bound sites are enriched for motifs that confer a lower in vitro affinity for CTCF, suggesting a mechanism where sites with low-binding affinity are more amenable to developmental control. Additionally, by comparing changes in CTCF binding with changes in gene expression during differentiation, we show that LowOc and HighOc sites are associated with distinct regulatory functions.  In sum, these results suggest that the regulatory control of CTCF   s binding and function is dependent in part upon specific motifs within its DNA binding site.

We reveal that the expression of two Topo II isoforms, Top2a and Top2  , is characteristic of dividing and postmitotic tissues, respectively. In embryonic stem cells, Top2a preferentially binds to promoters embedded in an active chromatin environment. Inhibition of Top2a activity results in misregulation of target gene expression that accompanies accumulation of double-strand breaks. Common targets of Top2a and Top2   are housekeeping genes while their unique targets are involved in proliferation/pluripotency and neurogenesis, respectively. Moreover, a subset of Top2a targets exhibit bivalent chromatin state that is resolved upon differentiation concomitant with their activation and occupancy by Top2  , a feature further observed for long genes. These findings suggest that Top2a not only contributes to stem cell transcriptome regulation but may also prime developmental genes for subsequent activation upon differentiation. mRNA profiles of DMSO and ICRF-193 treated mESCs were generated by deep sequencing in triplicates. ICRF-193 is a well established catalytic inhibitor of Topoisomerase II, hence, we used ICRF-193 to the elucidate role of Top2a catalytic activity on transcription by genome wide transcription profiling. ..

Antiviral RNAi involves the processing of viral long double-stranded (ds) RNA molecules into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the ribonuclease (RNAse) III Dicer. These siRNAs are incorporated into effector complex(es) containing members of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family and guide silencing of complementary target viral RNAs. Here, we detect the accumulation of phased Dicer-dependent virus-derived siRNA (viRNAs) and demonstrate their loading into Ago2 after infection of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). We further show that the production of these viRNAs is drastically reduced, yet not completely abolished, if ES cells are first induced to differentiate before infection. Finally, we reveal that the mammalian virus Nodamura virus (NoV) encodes for a protein that counteracts such antiviral RNAi in ES cells supporting the existence of an effective RNAi-based immunity in mammals.

Mature C57BL/CBA male mice were caged in sheds located in an urban area near two working steel mills and a major highway in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Control mice were housed in the same environment but received only high-efficiency particle-filtered air. Whole lung tissues were collected from mice exposed for 3 weeks, 10 weeks or for 10 weeks followed by 6 weeks in the laboratory (16 weeks total). DNA microarrays were used to explore changes in pulmonary gene expression in mice breathing ambient air versus HEPA-filtered air. Transcriptional profiling revealed changes in the expression of genes implicated in the lipid droplet synthesis pathway (plin, dgat2, lpl, s3-12, agpat2), antioxidants (ucp1). We postulate that exposure to particulate matter adsorbed with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons triggers lipid droplet synthesis (holding depots for lipids and malformed/excess proteins tagged for degradation) in the lungs, which act to sequester particulates adsorbed with toxic chemicals. Increased lipid droplet synthesis could potentially lead to endogenous/stressor-induced synthesis of reactive oxygen species and activation of antioxidant mechanisms. Further investigation into the stimulation of lipid droplet synthesis in the lung in response to air pollution is warranted in order to better understand these mechanistic changes and the resulting health implications. Mature male C57BL/6 x CBA F1 hybrid mice were exposed to either HEPA-filtered or ambient air in Hamilton, ON, Canada. Animals were exposed starting May 14, 2004 for 3 weeks (3wk), 10 weeks (10wk), or for 10 weeks followed by 6 weeks of recovery (16wk).

To decipher dynamic function of this complex layer, it is critical to characterize individual miRNA species within a specific cellular context. Small RNA cloning followed by deep sequencing is uniquely positioned as a genome-wide profiling method to quantify miRNA expression with potentially unlimited dynamic range and provide single-nucleotide resolution for precise miRNA classification and de novo discovery. However, significant biases introduced by RNA ligation steps in the current RNA cloning protocol often lead to inaccurate miRNA quantification by >1000-fold deviation. As a result, it has greatly hindered the broad application of this method. Here we report a highly efficient RNA cloning method that achieves over 90% efficiency for both 5    and 3    ligations with diverse small RNA substrates. When applied to a pool of either equimolar or differentially mixed synthetic miRNAs, the deviation of the cloning frequency for each miRNA is minimized to less than 2-fold of the anticipated value. By using samples obtained from multiple tissues and cells, we further demonstrate the accurate quantification of miRNA expression over a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. Our results also reveal that most cistronic miRNAs are expressed at similar levels and, in each cell population, miRNAs repress their cognate targets in a dosage dependent manner. Collectively, our high-efficiency RNA cloning method combining with deep sequencing establishes a cost-effective approach for accurate genome-wide miRNA profiling. We designed an artificial system composed of synthetic miRNAs for benchmarking biases in small RNA cDNA cloning for NGS. ..

Intestinal, stomach and liver Lgr5+ stem cells grow in 3D cultures to form ever-expanding organoids, which resemble the tissues of origin. Wnt signaling is inactive and Lgr5 is not expressed under physiological conditions in the adult pancreas. However, we now report that the Wnt pathway is robustly activated upon injury by Partial Duct Ligation (PDL), concomitant with the appearance of Lgr5 expression in regenerating pancreatic ducts. In vitro, duct fragments from mouse pancreas initiate Lgr5 expression in RSPO1-based cultures, and develop into budding cyst-like structures (organoids) which expand 5-fold weekly for >40 weeks. Single isolated duct cells can also be cultured into pancreatic organoids, containing Lgr5 stem/progenitor cells that can be clonally expanded. Clonal pancreas organoids can be induced to differentiate into duct as well as endocrine cells upon transplantation, thus proving their bi-potentiality We generated arrays from whole pancreas, islet, acinar and duct (Sox9+ sorted) cells and pancreas derived cultures maintained in our defined medium.

Among the different genes our attention was attracted by a gene that encodes for a novel f-box protein (Fbxo30) belonging to the SCF complex family of the ubiquitin ligases. Cell size is determined by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. This equilibrium is affected by hormones, nutrients, energy levels, mechanical stress and cytokines. Mutations that inactivate Myostatin lead to important muscle growth in animals and humans. However, the signals and pathways responsible for this hypertrophy remain largely unknown. Here we find that BMP signaling, acting through Smad1/5/8, is the fundamental hypertrophic signal. Inhibition of BMP signaling causes muscle atrophy, abolishes the hypertrophic phenotype of Myostatin knockout and strongly exacerbates the effects of denervation and fasting. BMP-Smad1/5/8 negatively regulates a novel gene (Fbxo30) that encodes an ubiquitin ligase, that is required for muscle loss. Collectively, these data identify a critical role for the BMP pathway in adult muscle maintenance, growth and atrophy.

Deficiency of FA has been associated with the pathogenesis of neural tube defects. Since FA can modulate DNA methylation and affect gene expression, we investigated the effect of gestational FA supplementation on the expression of genes in the offspring brain.

Our group have identified KLF13 as an essential transcription factor for the late expression of chemokine RANTES in T lymphocytes. However, very little is known about the role of KLF13 in T cells and other potential transcriptional targets. To address this, we sought to identify genes that are regulated by KLF13 in mouse T cells. Using microarray analysis, we compared gene expression in activated CD3+ T lymphocytes from wild type and Klf13-/- animals. We isolated CD3+ T-cells from WT and KO mouse spleen. Isolated cells were activated with CD3 and CD28 for 4 days and RNA was extracted.

Working exclusively in vivo, we used a    bottom-up    approach to infer pathways in the genetic regulation of lipid metabolism by the UPR. We used a functional genomics to link gene expression patterns taken from microarray data to the severity and persistence of ER stress, using mice lacking the UPR signaling molecule ATF6  .

To address this issue in an in vivo neuronal population, we assessed the patterning, stability, and function of the base within gene bodies in olfactory sensory neurons. We find that gene body 5hmC linearly correlates with transcriptional output and is stable in fully mature neurons and those lacking de novo methyltransferase activity. Overexpression of Tet3, which oxidizes methylated cytosines (5mC) to 5hmC, markedly alters gene body 5hmC levels and provides evidence that 5hmC facilitates transcription. This manipulation disrupts olfactory receptor expression and the targeting of axons to the olfactory bulb, key molecular and anatomical features of the olfactory system that are necessary for proper physiology. Our results support a direct, positive and physiologically significant role for gene body 5hmC in transcriptional elongation and the maintenance of cellular identity independent of its function as an intermediate to demethylation. We assessed the role of 5hmC in mature olfactory sensory neurons by assessing 5hmC levels in 2 month old neurons, olfactory epithelia lacking Dnmt3a, and mOSNs overexpressing Tet3.

While the mechanisms underlying sarcopenia remain unclear, the skeletal muscle stem cell, or satellite cell, is required for muscle regeneration. Therefore, identification of signaling pathways affecting satellite cell function during aging may provide insights into therapeutic targets for combating sarcopenia. Here, we show that a cell-autonomous loss in self-renewal occurs via novel alterations in FGF and p38     MAPK signaling in old satellite cells. We further demonstrate that pharmacological manipulation of these pathways can ameliorate age-associated self-renewal defects. Thus, our data highlight an age-associated deregulation of a satellite cell homeostatic network and reveals potential therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of progressive muscle wasting.

For the purpose of comparability and integration of research, two European consortia, Mitofood and BIOCLAIMS, proposed an AIN-93-based standard reference diet, the standardized BIOCLAIMS low-fat diet (LFD) as well as a high-fat diet (HFD). In order to evaluate the BIOCLAIMS LFD and HFD, we performed short-term (5 days) and long-term (12 weeks) feeding experiments using male C57BL/6 mice. The HFD has the same composition as the LFD except the fat content is increased to 40% energy in exchange for carbohydrates. Both diets were accepted by the animals and proof of principle was given that the BIOCLAIMS HFD increases body weight and body fat and affects glucose homeostasis. Short-term feeding trials (5 days) were performed in order to identify metabolic and molecular parameters which can serve as acute predictors for metabolic disorders due to high-fat diet-induced obesity. We analyzed gene expression in gonadal white adipose tissue of short- and long-term fed animals with whole genome microarrays. The BIOCLAIMS HFD strongly influenced gene expression in white adipose tissue after short- and long-term intervention. A total number of 973 and 4678 transcripts were significantly different between both diets after 5 days feeding and 12 weeks feeding, respectively. A total number of 764 transcripts encoding 549 genes were significantly differentially regulated between LF and HF animals after 12 weeks feeding as well as after 5 days feeding. Of these 549 overlapping genes, a substantial number (434 genes) were expressed at a lower level and 115 genes were expressed at a higher level in the HF mice compared to the LF mice. Without exception, all genes were regulated equally. Pathway analysis revealed a prominent role for genes involved in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. This was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The high predictive value of gene expression changes in our short-term study compared to long-term high fat feeding is a promising step to get well-defined, early biomarkers that could shorten animal trials considerably and allow a more rapid and efficient screening of different compounds. C57BL/6J wildtype male mice, aged 12 weeks, received a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet for 5 days or 12 weeks.

In MHC-CELFdelta transgenic mice, CELF splicing activity is inhibited postnatally in heart muscle via expression of a nuclear dominant negative CELF protein under an a-myosin heavy chain promoter.  MHC-CELFdelta mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by alternative splicing defects, enlarged hearts, and severe contractile dysfunction.  In this study, gene expression profiles in the hearts of wild type, high- and low-expressing lines of MHC-CELFdelta mice were compared using microarrays.  Gene ontology and pathway analyses identified contraction and calcium signaling as the most affected processes.  Network analysis revealed that the serum response factor (SRF) network is highly affected.  Downstream targets of SRF were up-regulated in MHC-CELFdelta mice compared to the wild type, suggesting an increase in SRF activity.  Although SRF levels remained unchanged, known inhibitors of SRF activity were down-regulated.  These results suggest a role for CELF-mediated alternative splicing in the regulation of contractile gene expression, achieved in part through modulating the activity of SRF, a key cardiac transcription factor. Microarray analysis was performed on total RNA extracted from whole hearts of three MHC-CELFdelta-10 and three MHC-CELFdelta-574 females collected at weaning (three weeks old).

However, so far such reporter assays have been of low throughput. Here we describe a multiplexing approach for the parallel monitoring of transcriptional activity of thousands of randomly integrated reporters. More than 27,000 distinct reporter integrations in mouse embryonic stem cells, obtained with two different promoters, show ~1,000-fold variation in expression levels. Data analysis indicates that lamina-associated domains act as attenuators of transcription, likely by reducing access of transcription factors to binding sites. Furthermore, chromatin compaction is predictive of reporter activity. We also found evidence for cross-talk between neighboring genes, and estimate that enhancers can influence gene expression on average over ~20 kb.

At selected gene loci, cohesin complexes have been proposed to arrange chromatin fibers into higher-order structures, but it is poorly understood how cohesin performs this task, how important this function is for determining the structure of chromosomes, and how this process is regulated to allow changes in gene expression. Here we show that the cohesin release factor Wapl controls chromatin structure and gene regulation at numerous loci throughout the mouse genome. Conditional deletion of the Wapl gene leads to stable accumulation of cohesin on chromatin, chromatin compaction, altered gene expression, cell cycle delay, chromosome segregation defects and embryonic lethality. In Wapl deficient chromosomes, cohesin accumulates in an axial domain, similar to how condensins form a    scaffold    in mitotic chromosomes.

Here we discover and characterize the sets of lncRNAs induced by inflammatory signaling via TNF  .  TNF   regulates hundreds of lncRNAs, including 54 pseudogene lncRNAs, several of which show exquisitely selective expression in response to specific cytokines and microbial components in a NF-  B-dependent manner. Lethe, a pseudogene lncRNA, is selectively induced by proinflammatory cytokines via NF-  B or glucocorticoid receptor agonist, and functions in negative feedback signaling to NF-  B.  Lethe interacts with NF-  B subunit RelA to inhibit RelA DNA binding and target gene activation.  Lethe level decreases with organismal age, a physiological state associated with increased NF-  B activity.

We have established a culture system that recapitulates the mouse germ-cell specification pathway: Using cytokines, embryonic stem cells (ESCs)/induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are induced into epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and then into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) with capacity both for spermatogenesis and oogenesis, creating an opportunity for understanding and regulating mammalian germ cell development in both sexes in vitro. Here we show that, without cytokines, simultaneous over-expression of three transcription factors (TFs), Blimp1 (also known as Prdm1), Prdm14 and Tfap2c (also known as AP2  ), directs EpiLCs, but not ESCs, swiftly and highly efficiently into a PGC state with endogenous transcription circuitry. The induction of the PGC state on EpiLCs minimally requires Prdm14 but not Blimp1 or Tfap2c. The TF-induced PGC state reconstitutes key transcriptome and epigenetic reprogramming in PGCs, but bypasses a mesodermal program that accompanies PGC specification in vivo and in vitro by cytokines including BMP4. Importantly, the TF-induced PGC-like cells robustly contribute to spermatogenesis and fertile offspring. Our findings provide not only a novel insight into the transcriptional logic that creates a germ cell state, but also a foundation for the TF-based reconstitution and regulation of mammalian gametogenesis. Aim of this analysis is characterization of transcription factor-induced primordial germ cells (TF-PGCLCs) compared with cytokine-induced primordial germ cells (Ck-PGCLCs) (Hayashi et al., 2011, Cell), epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) (Hayashi et al., 2011, Cell), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and identification of genes differentially expressed among them. TF-PGCLCs induced by multiple combinations of TFs (Blimp1 (B), Prdm14 (P14), and Tfap2c (A) (BP14A), BP14, P14A, P14) on day 2 and 4 (for BP14A cells) of the induction were also compared.

Many questions remain unanswered regarding the contributions of these enzymes to specialized genetic networks that control critical processes such as lineage commitment and cellular differentiation. We have been addressing this problem in the context of erythrocyte development driven by the transcription factor GATA-1 and its coregulator Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1). As certain GATA-1 target genes have little to no FOG-1 requirement for expression, presumably additional coregulators can mediate GATA-1 function. Using a genetic complementation assay and RNA interference in GATA-1-null cells, we demonstrate a vital link between GATA-1 and the histone H4 lysine 20 methyltransferase PR-Set7/SetD8 (SetD8). GATA-1 selectively induced H4 monomethylated lysine 20 at repressed, but not activated, loci, and endogenous SetD8 mediated GATA-1-dependent repression of a cohort of its target genes. GATA-1 utilized different combinations of SetD8, FOG-1, and the FOG-1-interacting Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex component Mi2b to repress distinct target genes. Implicating SetD8 as a context-dependent GATA-1 corepressor expands the repertoire of coregulators mediating establishment/maintenance of the erythroid cell genetic network and provides a biological framework for dissecting the cell type-specific functions of this important coregulator. We propose a coregulator matrix model in which distinct combinations of chromatin regulators are required at different GATA-1 target genes, and the unique attributes of the target loci mandate these combinations. 3 SetD8 knockdown samples were compared to 3 control samples ..

In mouse models of cancer, they have been shown to be immune suppressive, but studies of their occurrence and function in normal tissues have been limited. With a transgenic mouse line permitting the bioluminescent imaging of FAP(+) cells, we find that they reside in most tissues of the adult mouse. FAP(+) cells from three sites, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and pancreas, have highly similar transcriptomes, suggesting a shared lineage. FAP(+) cells of skeletal muscle are the major local source of follistatin, and in bone marrow they express Cxcl12 and KitL. Experimental ablation of these cells causes loss of muscle mass and a reduction of B-lymphopoiesis and erythropoiesis, revealing their essential functions in maintaining normal muscle mass and hematopoiesis, respectively. Remarkably, these cells are altered at these sites in transplantable and spontaneous mouse models of cancer-induced cachexia and anemia. Thus, the FAP(+) stromal cell may have roles in two adverse consequences of cancer: their acquisition by tumors may cause failure of immunosurveillance, and their alteration in normal tissues contributes to the paraneoplastic syndromes of cachexia and anemia. FAP+ cells were sorted from two mesenchymal tissues, visceral adipose and skeletal muscle, and from an epithelial organ, the pancreas. These were compared to MEFs. Cells were isolated in duplicate experiments and these were analysed separately. These were compared to previously published publically available CD4+ T-cell subset data. ..

Mouse ooplasts transplanted with 2 somatic cell nuclei simultaneously (double nuclear transfer) support preimplantation development and the derivation of tetraploid NT embryonic stem cells (tNT-ES cells). These cells are unique in that they embody the first case of cloned ES cells containing two reprogrammed somatic genomes at the same time and exhibit characteristics of true pluripotency. By assessing allelic expression of Oct4 in normal and double nucleus transplanted embryos throughout development we demonstrate that oocyte mediated reprogramming is embarked with a probabilistic component and that one reprogrammed genome can dominate the other during preimplantation development  even if merged into the same nucleus. Animal handling and cell recovery: Oocytes from mice of the B6C3F1 strain were used for SCNT and ICSI. Cumulus cells (for SCNT) and sperm (for ICSI) were either from a B6C3F1 or OG2 donor the latter expressing an Oct4 promoter-driven GFP transgene. Additionally cells from pure C56Bl/6 or C3H mice were retrieved for SCNT. Female mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 14 h after hCG injection  and oocytes retrieved from oviduct ampullae. Oocytes and cumulus cells were handled in Hepes-buffered CZB (HCZB) medium. Double nuclear transfer  ICSI and embryo culture: Micromanipulations and embryo culture were performed at 30  C (room temperature). For SCNT oocytes were first enucleated (spindle-chromosome complex removed) before transfer of one  two or three cell nuclei with a micropipette driven by a piezo actuator under Nomarski optics. The reconstructed oocytes were activated for 6 h in Calcium-free alpha-MEM supplemented with 10 mM SrCl2 and 5 micro-g mL-1 cytochalasin B. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of one  two or four into intact oocytes was used as the fertilization control condition  using sperm from 8-week-old mice of B6C3F1 or OG2 strains. Embryos were placed in embryo culture medium and cultured at 37  C under 5% CO2. The activated oocytes were cultured in alpha-MEM at 37  C and under 5% CO2 until use. On day 5 after activation SCNT and ICSI blastocysts were processed for ESC derivation. Analysis of allelic expression of Oct4: RNA from single embryos was extracted using the ZR-RNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo Research). Complementary DNA synthesis was performed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers instruction. A nested PCR was performed to amplify part of the Oct4 cDNA containing a BamH1 sensitive SNP. Primer sequences and PCR conditions are given in the supplementary methods. The PCR product was digested for 8h using 100 units of BamH1-HF (NEB) subsequently subjected to agarose gel electrophoreses and the results grouped into 3 categories (mainly C57Bl/6  balanced mainly C3H) according to the observed band patterns. Global transcriptome analysis by microarray: RNA samples to be analyzed by microarrays were prepared using Qiagen RNeasy columns with on-column DNA digestion. 300 ng of total RNA per sample was used as input into a linear amplification protocol (Ambion) which involved synthesis of T7-linked double-stranded cDNA and 12 hours of in vitro transcription incorporating biotin-labelled nucleotides. Purified and labeled cRNA was then hybridized for 18h onto a MouseRef-8 v2 expression BeadChip (Illumina) following the manufacturer instructions. After washing as recommended chips were stained with streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare) and scanned using the iScan reader (Illumina) and accompanying software.

We investigated the molecular signature of microglia and identified 239 genes and 8 microRNAs that were uniquely or highly expressed in microglia vs. myeloid and other immune cells. Out of 239 genes, 106 were enriched in microglia as compared to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. This microglia signature was not observed in microglial lines or in monocytes recruited to the CNS and was also observed in human microglia. Based on this signature, we found a crucial role for TGF-   in microglial biology that included: 1) the requirement of TGF-   for the in vitro development of microglia that express the microglial molecular signature characteristic of adult microglia; and 2) the absence of microglia in CNS TGF-  1 deficient mice.

However, while sporadic translocations decapitate Myc from 5' proximal regulatory elements, most endemic events occur hundreds of kilobases away from Myc. The origin of these rearrangements and how they deregulate oncogenes at such distances remain unclear. Here we recapitulate endemic BL-like translocations in plasmacytomas from uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) deficient mice. We demonstrate that in these animals, rare endemic-like translocations arise from non-targeted DNA breaks at Myc loci. Deep-sequencing analyses revealed that the deregulated 3' Igh enhancer alpha physically interacts with and remodels 0.45Mb of translocated chromatin. The results thus explain the long-range deregulation of oncogenes in human and mouse B cell tumors.

Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are likely to be involved, and we have shown a strong effect of anti-CD3 on homeostatic control of CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. To analyze the early consequences of anti-CD3 treatment, we sorted and profiled Treg and conventional CD4+ T (Tconv) cells in the first hours and days after anti-CD3 treatment of NOD mice. In practice, NOD mice carrying the Foxp3-GFP reporter were treated with anti-CD3 mAb KT3 (50 ug iv) and CD4+ T cells were sorted from pooled spleen and lymph nodes after 2, 8, 24 and 72 hrs, separating Treg and Tconv cells on the basis of GFP expression. Anti-CD3 treatment led to a transient transcriptional response, terminating faster than most antigen-induced responses. Most transcripts were similarly induced in Treg and Tconv cells, but several were differential, in particular those encoding the IL7 receptor (IL7R) and transcription factors Id2/3 and Gfi1, upregulated in Treg but repressed in Tconv cells. In parallel experiments, we tested the effect of soluble anti-CD3 added to cultures of fresh splenocytes, sorting Treg and Tconv cells at the same time points. Many of the anti-CD3 elicited changes, and of the differential response observed in vivo, were also observed in vitro.

We have observed in pancreatic islets that stimulatory glucose concentrations induced a gene profile that was similar to that of freshly isolated islets, indicating that glucose-elicited cues are involved in maintaining   -cell identity. Low glucose induces the expression of ubiquitous genes involved in stress responses, nutrient sensing, and organelle biogenesis. By contrast, stimulatory glucose concentrations activate genes with a more restricted expression pattern (  - and neuronal- cell identity). Consistently, glucose-induced genes are globally reduced in islets deficient with Hnf1a (MODY3), characterized by a deficient glucose metabolism. Of interest, a cell cycle gene module was the most enriched among the variable genes between intermediate and stimulatory glucose concentrations. Glucose regulation of the islet transcriptome was unexpectedly broadly maintained in islets from aged mice. However, the cell cycle gene module is selectively lost in old islets and the glucose activation of this module is not recovered even in the absence of the cell cycle inhibitor p16. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression regulated by glucose in young and aged pancreatic islets as well as freshly-isolated islets. Pancreatic islets from young and old mice were isolated and cultured at different glucose concentrations for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. Islets were cultured at 3mM (G3), 5.5mM (G5), 11mM (G11) and 16mM (G16). Freshly-isolated islets (F) were also processed for RNA extraction .

Here we report that leukemias initiated by a Trithorax-related oncogene, MLL-AF9, depend upon the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to sustain a transformed cellular state. RNAi mediated suppression of PRC2 subunits is sufficient to inhibit proliferation of MLL-AF9 leukemias, with little impact on growth of non-transformed cells. This requirement is partly due to PRC2-mediated transcriptional repression of several anti-self-renewal regulators, including Cdkn2a. These results suggest that, unlike the classical antagonism generally observed between Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins during development, the activities of these two pathways can cooperate to promote myeloid neoplasia. In order to understand downstream targets of PRC2 complex in MLL-AF9 leukemia, we performed array in murine MLL-AF9/NrasG12D cell line under the condition that two subunits of PRC2(Eed and Suz12) were suppressed by using shRNAs. ..

As such, they have been a major focus of efforts to manipulate cell fate for therapeutic purposes. The ETS transcription factor PU.1 has a potent ability to confer macrophage phenotypes on cells already committed to a different lineage, but how it overcomes the presence of other master regulators is not known. The nuclear receptor PPAR   is the master regulator of the adipose lineage, and its genomic binding pattern is well characterized in adipocytes. Here, we show that when expressed at macrophage levels in mature adipocytes, PU.1 bound a large fraction of its macrophage sites, where it induced chromatin opening and the expression of macrophage target genes. Strikingly, PU.1 markedly reduced the genomic binding of PPAR   without changing its abundance. PU.1 expression repressed genes with nearby adipocyte-specific PPAR   binding sites, while a common macrophage-adipocyte gene expression program was retained. Together, these data reveal unexpected lability within the adipocyte PPAR   cistrome and show that even in terminally differentiated cells, PU.1 can remodel the cistrome of another master regulator. Microarray expression profiling was performed on 3T3-L1 adipocytes from two treatment groups: (1) adipocytes transduced with a control adenovirus expressing beta-galactosidase (LACZ-Ads) and (2) adipocytes transduced with an adenovirus expressing full-length murine PU.1 cDNA (PU.1-Ads).

Transcription factors are critical in the generation and maintenance of cellular diversity and negative regulators antagonistic to alternate fates often act in conjunction with positive regulators to stabilize lineage specification1. Polymorphisms within the locus encoding a transcription factor BACH2 are associated with diverse immune-mediated diseases including asthma2, multiple sclerosis3, Crohn  s disease4-5, coeliac disease6, vitiligo7 and type 1 diabetes8. A role for Bach2 in maintaining immune homeostasis, however, has not been established. Here, we define Bach2 as a broad regulator of immune activation that stabilizes immunoregulatory capacity while repressing the differentiation programmes of multiple effector lineages in CD4+ T cells. Bach2 was required for efficient formation of regulatory (Treg) cells and consequently for suppression of lethal inflammation in a manner that was Treg cell dependent. Assessment of the genome-wide function of Bach2, however, revealed that it represses genes associated with effector cell differentiation. Consequently, its absence during Treg polarization resulted in inappropriate diversion to effector lineages. In addition, Bach2 constrained full effector differentiation within Th1, Th2 and Th17 cell lineages. These findings identify Bach2 as a key regulator of CD4+ T-cell differentiation that prevents inflammatory disease by controlling the balance between tolerance and immunity. The role of Bach2t to regulate immune homeostasis was investigated by mapping DNA binding profiles of Bach2 in iTreg condition.The function of Bach2 was also evaluated by comparing transcriptome in WT and Bach2-deficient iTreg cells and further comparison was done with transcriptome in naive, Th1, Th2, and Th17 conditions. .. freshly isolated naive CD4+ T cells;  in vitro polarized T helper1 cells for 3 days;  in vitro polarized T helper17 cells for 3 days;  in vitro polarized T helper2 cells for 3 days;  in vitro polarized inducible regulatory cells for 3 days;  anti-Bach2 - rabbit antibody (generated in-house, Tohoku University);  none (input lysate);  Bach2KO;  wild type;  genomic DNA;  total RNA;  FACS sorted naive CD4+T cells;  FACS sorted naive CD4+T cells cultured in vitro for 3 days under Th1 condition;  FACS sorted naive CD4+T cells cultured in vitro for 3 days under Th17 condition;  FACS sorted naive CD4+T cells cultured in vitro for 3 days under Th2 condition;  FACS sorted naive CD4+T cells cultured in vitro for 3 days under iTreg condition;  primary CD4+ T cells from spleen and lymph nodes;  C57BL/6J;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Alternative splicing (AS) represents a widely acting mode of gene regulation, yet its role in the regulation of ESC pluripotency and differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we identify the Muscleblind-like RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, as conserved and direct negative regulators of a large program of AS events that are differentially regulated between ESCs and other cell types. Knockdown of MBNL proteins in differentiated cells causes switching to an ESC-like AS pattern for at least half of these AS events. Among the events is an ESC-specific AS switch in the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP1 that controls pluripotency. Consistent with a central and negative regulatory role for MBNL proteins in pluripotency, their knockdown significantly enhances the expression of key pluripotency genes and the formation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) during somatic cell reprogramming. mRNA profiles of various embryonic stem cells, tissues and cell lines from human and mouse using high-throughput sequencing data and the role of MBNL proteins in regulation of ESC-differential alternative splicing .. secondary reprogramming cells;  total RNA;  secondary reprogramming cells;  10090;  Mus musculus;  21 d;  dox;  Secondary MEFs were treated with doxycycline for 21 days;

The contribution of cross-presentation to the induction of anti-viral cytotoxic T cells remains debated. Here, we used a recombinant influenza virus expressing a NS1-GFP reporter gene to visualize the route of antigen presentation by lung dendritic cells (DC) upon viral infection in vivo. We found that lung CD103+ DC are the only subset to carry intact GFP protein to the draining lymph nodes. Strikingly, lung migratory CD103+ DC are not productively infected by influenza virus and thus induce virus-specific CD8+ T cells through the cross-presentation of antigens from virally infected cells. We also show that CD103+ DC resistance to infection correlates with an increased antiviral state in these cells that is dependent on the expression of IFN receptor alpha. In conclusion, these results establish that efficient cross-priming by migratory lung DC is coupled to the acquisition of an anti-viral status, which is dependent on type I IFN signaling pathway. mRNA profiles were generated by deep-sequencing in Illumina HiSeq2000 from alveolar macrophages and CD103+ dendritic cells from lungs of untreated and flu-treated mice ..

These are promoted by activators such as the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family members. In order to further understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the early events leading the phagocytosis of the pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we set out to examine potential roles of miRNAs in phagocytosis using genome-wide expression profiling to identify miRNAs differentially regulated following mycobacterial infection. One of the miRNAs activated upon infection of mouse macrophages with the non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis, the widely conserved miR-142-3p, was predicted and confirmed to target the Neural-WASP (N-WASP). Upregulating of miR-142-3p in mouse macrophages inversely correlated with levels of N-WASP, upon infection with live pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria, suggesting an active role of Mycobacterium tuberculosis on the regulation of phagocytosis, at the post-transcriptional level, in host cells. The reduction of N-WASP correlated with a reduced internalization of bacteria per macrophage, independently of the phagocytosis index. Furthermore, the downregulation of WASP levels accompanied those of N-WASP, at early but not at late time points, suggesting a closely regulatory mechanism among both family members, dependent on the time frame of the phagocytosis. Additionally, upregulating of miR-142-3p promoted the change in the protein levels of another predicted and confirmed target, the Cofilin2 protein, in a phagocytosis-independent fashion. Downregulation experiments promoted aberrant morphologic phenotypes in macrophages, similar to observed by others in PBMCs of humans with Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome, suggesting the strong involvement of miR-142-3p on the regulation of the actin machinery in macrophages. Altogether these results show for the first time that miRNAs are involved in the regulation of actin-mediated phagocytosis of pathogenic bacteria and that these are direct targets of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The most typical and serious outcome of the chronic oriental schistosomiasis is the progressive granuloma and fibrosis in the host liver, which has been a major medical challenge. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the hepatic pathogenesis induced by schistosomal egg deposition have not yet been well-defined. Using microarrays, we quantified the temporal gene expression profiles in the liver of Schistosoma japonicum-infected BALB/c mice at day 15, 30, and 45 post infection (pi) with that from uninfected mice as controls. Meanwhile, microRNA expression profiles from the same samples were decoded by parallel solexa sequencing. Gene expression alternation associated with liver damage was observed even at early stage of infection (e.g., pi 15), which became more magnificent onset of egg deposition within the liver tissue. Up-regulated genes were dominantly associated with inflammatory infiltration of liver during S. japonicum infection, whereas down-regulated genes primarily led to the hepatic functional disorders. More than 130 miRNAs were differentially expressed during S. japonicum infection, and dynamic miRNA-gene co-expression network has been constructed during the development of hepatic pathology.

Here we show that the increased frequency of Zscan4 activation in mouse ES cells not only enhances, but also maintains their developmental potency in long-term cell culture. As the potency increases, even a whole animal can be produced from a single ES cell injected into 4N blastocyst at unusually high success rate. Although Zscan4-activated cells express genes that are also expressed in 2-cell stage mouse embryos, transiently Zscan4-activated state of ES cells is not associated with the high potency of ES cells. It is thus concluded that ES cells acquire higher potency by going through transient Zscan4 activation state more frequently than the regular state. Taken together, our results indicate that frequent activation of Zscan4 can rejuvenate pluripotent stem cells. Previously, we have shown that constitutive and strong expression of Zscan4 arrest the proliferation of ES cells (refs). We sought for the system to mimic the transient expression of Zscan4 and decided to use ERT2 - Tamoxifen-inducible system (refs). The system allows one to keep a transgene off in the absence of Tmx and turn on in the presence of Tmx at will (refs). We first made a plasmid construct pCAG-Zscan4-ERT2, in which ZSCAN4 ORF fused with ERT2 domain can be driven by a strong ubiquitous promoter CAG. To further investigate this, we transfected pCAG-Zscan4-ERT2 plasmid into an F1 hybrid (C57BL/6J vs. 129) ES cell line V6.5 and isolated multiple cell clones. Based on the qRT-PCR analysis of Zscan4 ORF, we found that cell clones showed a variety of Zscan4 expression levels.

The formation of caveolae is dependent of the expression of various structural proteins that serve as scaffolding for these membrane invaginations.

Here we show that retroviral delivery of an estrogen-regulated form of Hoxb8 into mouse bone marrow cells can be used along with Flt3 ligand to conditionally immortalize early hematopoietic progenitor cells (Hoxb8-FL cells). Hoxb8-FL cells have lost self-renewal capacity and potential to differentiate into megakaryocytes and erythrocytes but retain the potential to differentiate into myeloid and lymphoid cells. They differentiate in vitro and in vivo into macrophages, granulocytes, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes that are phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from their primary counterparts. Quantitative in vitro assays indicate that myeloid and B-cell potential of Hoxb8-FL cells is comparable to that of primary lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors, whereas T-cell potential is diminished.

Alternative splicing contributes to muscle development and differentiation, but the complete set of muscle splicing factors and their combinatorial interactions are not known. Previously work identifies ACUAA (STAR motif) as an enriched sequence near muscle-specific alternative exons such as Capzb exon 9. We did mass spectrometry of proteins selected by wild type and mutant Capzb intron 9 RNA affinity chromatography, and identified Quaking (Qk), a protein known to regulate mRNA function through ACUAA motifs in 3' UTRs. We show that in myoblasts, Qk promotes inclusion of Capzb exon 9 in opposition to repression by PTB. Qk knockdown in myoblasts has little effect on transcript levels, but alters inclusion of 824 cassette exons whose adjacent intron sequences are enriched in ACUAA motifs. During differentiation to myotubes, Qk levels increase 2-3 fold, suggesting a mechanism for Qk-responsive exon regulation.  We captured the PTB splicing regulatory network and intersected it with the Qk network, identifying overlap between the functions of Qk and PTB. Approximately 60% of exons whose inclusion is altered during myogenesis appear to be under control of one or both of these splicing factors in myoblasts. This series is the C2C12 Qk and PTB siRNA data. It is 12 arrays: 3 PTB siRNA arrays , 3 Qk siRNA arrays, and 6 mock siRNA arrays. ..

As exon-switching events have the potential to give rise to isoforms with different cellular functions, we have explored the role of the muscle-specific (Mef2Da2) and ubiquitously expressed (Mef2Da1) isoforms of the transcription factor Mef2D in myogenesis. Here we show that both isoforms of Mef2D bind a largely overlapping subset of genomic loci, yet only the muscle-specific Mef2Da2 isoform can activate the late myogenic gene expression program. This differential ability to activate transcription is modulated by PKA signaling where Mef2Da1 is efficiently phosphorylated by the kinase to enhance its association with repressive HDAC-deacetylase complexes. In contrast, alternate exon usage in Mef2Da2 renders the protein resistant to PKA phosphorylation, allowing it to interact with transcriptionally permissive Ash2L-trithorax complex. Our findings support a model wherein alternative exon usage allows Mef2D to transition from a repressor to activator in a myogenic environment rich in PKA activity. Thus we have identified a novel paradigm in which a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor has evolved to undergo tissue-specific alternative exon usage to permit the proper temporal activation of a gene expression program during differentiation.

To study this hypothesis, we compared the gene expression profiles in liver and in WAT between WT and CD44 knockout (CD44KO) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 21 weeks. This analysis demonstrated that several genes associated with triglyceride synthesis and accumulation, including Mogat2, Cidea, Cidea, Apoa4, and Elovl7, were decreased in the livers of CD44KO mice compared to WT mice. Many genes encoding pro-inflammatory chemokines and chemokine receptors also were decreased in the livers of CD44KO mice. Analysis with WAT showed that genes associated with triglyceride accumulation, including Fasn, Elovl6 and Mogat2, were increased in WAT of CD44KO(HFD) mice compared to WT(HFD) mice. Moreover, many genes associated with inflammation, including cytokines (Cxcl14, Cxcl12, Il33, and Il2), cytokine receptors (Ccr1, Il6ra, Il10rb), trypases (Tpsb2, Tpsab1, Tpsg1), and cellular matrix proteins (Integrin   4 (Itga4), ItgaM, Itgb2), were decreased in WAT of CD44(HFD) compared to WT(HFD) mice.

Patients frequently present at diagnosis with metastatic disease, particularly to the bone marrow.  Advances in therapy and understanding of the metastatic process have been limited due in part, to the lack of animal models harboring bone marrow disease.  The widely employed transgenic model, the TH-MYCN mouse, exhibits limited metastasis to this site.  Here we establish the first genetic immunocompetent mouse model for metastatic neuroblastoma with enhanced secondary tumors in the bone marrow.  This model recapitulates two frequent alterations in metastatic neuroblasoma, over-expression of MYCN and loss of caspase-8 expression.  In this model, the mouse caspase-8 gene was deleted in neural crest lineage cells by crossing a TH-Cre transgenic mouse with a caspase-8 conditional knockout mouse. This mouse was then crossed with the neuroblastoma prone TH-MYCN mouse.  While over-expression of MYCN by itself rarely caused bone marrow metastasis (5% average incidence), combining MYCN overexpression and caspase-8 deletion significantly increased bone marrow metastasis (37% average incidence).  Loss of caspase-8 expression did not alter the site, incidence, or latency of the primary tumors.  However, secondary tumors were detected in the bone marrow of these mice as early as week 9-10. The mouse model described in this work is a valuable tool to enhance our understanding of metastatic neuroblastoma and treatment options and underscores the role of caspase-8 in neuroblastoma progression.

A fraction of P-TEFb is sequestered in an inhibitory complex containing the 7SK noncoding RNA, but it has been unclear how P-TEFb is switched from the 7SK complex to RNAP II during transcription activation. We report that SRSF2 (also known as SC35, an SR splicing factor) is part of the 7SK complex assembled at gene promoters and plays a direct role in transcription pause release. We demonstrate RNA-dependent, coordinated release of SRSF2 and P-TEFb from the 7SK complex and transcription activation via SRSF2 binding to promoter-associated nascent RNA. These findings reveal an unanticipated SR protein function, a role for promoter-proximal nascent RNA in gene activation, and an analogous mechanism to HIV Tat/TAR for activating cellular genes.

In GC-B cells, AID is highly expressed, with inherent mutator activity that helps generate antibody diversity. However, AID may also regulate gene expression epigenetically, irrespective of mutator activity, by directly deaminating 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in concert with base excision repair glycosylases to exchange unmethylated cytosine. This pathway promotes gene demethylation, thereby removing epigenetic memory. For example, AID promotes active demethylation of the genome in primordial germ cells. However, the range and mechanism by which AID promotes pluripotency is not known. Different studies have suggested either a requirement or a lack of function for promoting pluripotency in somatic nuclei following fusion with embryonic stem cells (ESC). Here we tested directly whether AID regulates epigenetic memory, by comparing the relative ability of cells lacking AID to reprogram from a differentiated cell type to an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC). We show that loss of AID impacts two distinct steps of reprogramming: First, AID-null cells are transiently hyper-responsive to the reprogramming process. Second, although they initiate expression of pluripotency genes, they fail to stabilize the pluripotent state. The genome of AID-null cells remains hypermethylated in reprogramming cells, and hypermethylated genes associated with pluripotency fail to be stably up-regulated. MYC target genes are highly enriched in the set of genes hypermethylated and under-expressed in reprogramming cells lacking AID. Recent studies identified a distinctive late step of reprogramming associated with methylation status. AID appears to regulate this step to stabilize the pluripotent state, removing epigenetic memory to promote expression of secondary pluripotency network genes.

Recent bioinformatic analysis of global gene expression patterns has suggested a role for Bcl11a in the development of dendritic cell (DC) lineages. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the development of DC and other lineages in Bcl11a(-/-) mice. We show that Bcl11a is required for expression of IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) and Flt3 in early hematopoietic progenitor cells. The loss of IL-7R(+) common lymphoid progenitors accounts for previously described lymphoid defects in Bcl11a(-/-) mice. In addition, we found severely decreased numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in Bcl11a(-/-) fetal livers and in the bone marrow of Bcl11a(-/-) fetal liver chimeras. Moreover, Bcl11a(-/-) cells show severely impaired in vitro development of Flt3L-derived pDCs and classical DCs (cDCs). In contrast, we found normal in vitro development of DCs from Bcl11a(-/-) fetal liver cells treated with GM-CSF. These results suggest that the persistent cDC development observed in Bcl11a(-/-) fetal liver chimeras reflects derivation from a Bcl11a- and Flt3-independent pathway in vivo. We compared global gene expression by microarray for donor-derived wild-type and Bcl11a(-/-) populations isolated from chimeric bone marrow to identify Bcl11a target genes that explain its role in hematopoietic progenitors.

Transgenic mice overexpressing IGF-I in the retina showed impaired electroretinographic responses at 6-7 months of age that worsen with age.

Here, we identified the novel DNA associated protein TRNP1 as a regulator of cerebral cortical expansion in both these dimensions. Gain and loss of function experiments in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo demonstrate that high Trnp1 levels promote neural stem cell self-renewal and tangential expansion, while lower levels promote radial expansion resulting in a potent increase in the generation of intermediate progenitors and outer radial glial cells resulting in folding of the otherwise smooth murine cerebral cortex. Remarkably, TRNP1 expression levels exhibit regional differences also in the cerebral cortex of human fetuses anticipating radial or tangential expansion respectively.

Here we report that treatment with imatinib, an inhibitor of PDGFR  , led to significant tumor growth impairment associated with increased apoptosis in human lymphoma xenografts including Farage, Karpas422 and OCI-Ly7 in SCID mice. Confocal analysis of the tumor tissue showed decreased microvessel density, decreased vascular flow, and increased vascular leak in the imatinib-treated cohorts. Imatinib targeted tumor-associated PDGFR  + pericytes in vivo by inducing apoptosis and disruption of the PDGFR  + perivascular network, and PDGFR  + VSMC in vitro by inhibition of proliferation. FACS analysis of mononuclear cell suspension of tumor tissues revealed decreased mature pericytes and endothelial cells, as well as their progenitors with imatinib treatment. Compared to imatinib, treatment with anti-PDGFR   monoclonal antibody partially inhibited the growth of Farage lymphomas. Lastly, microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes in PDGFR  + VSMC following imatinib treatment showed significant down-regulation of genes implicated in proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, including those within PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways downstream of PDGFR   signaling.

Here, we comprehensively analyze lncRNA expression for the adult mouse subventricular zone neural stem cell lineage. We utilize complementary genome-wide techniques including RNA-seq, RNA CaptureSeq, and ChIP-seq to associate specific lncRNAs with neural cell types, developmental processes, and human disease states. By integrating data from chromatin state maps, custom microarrays, and FACS purification of the subventricular zone lineage, we stringently identify lncRNAs with potential roles in adult neurogenesis. shRNA-mediated knockdown of two such lncRNAs, Six3os and Dlx1as, indicate roles for lncRNAs in the glial-neuronal lineage specification of multipotent adult stem cells. Our data and workflow thus provide a uniquely coherent in vivo lncRNA analysis and form the foundation of a user-friendly online resource for the study of lncRNAs in development and disease. SVZ monolayer cultures were differentiated in vitro for 1,2,4 days, and gene expression changes were measured. SVZ lineage was isolated by FACS using established protocols to separate transit amplifying (TA), neuroblast (NB), activated stem cells (NSCs), and niche astrocytes (astros), and gene expression of each cell type was measured.

By obtaining genowide sequence from chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA with anti-CHOP and anit-ATF4, we identified direct binding sites of ATF4 and CHOP in promoter regions of their target genes in mouse embrynic fibroblasts (MEFs) in response to ER stress. In addition, we obtained list of genes which are differentially regulated in Atf4 or Chop-deficient MEFs compared to the wild-type MEFs in response to ER stress. We found that genes related with unfolded protein response and protein synthesis were directly regulated by ATF4 and CHOP. Through this observation, we conclude that main role of ATF4 and CHOP as transcription factors is to enhance mRNA translation in respone to ER stress. This sutdy provide new insight of genetic network of ATF4 and CHOP in response to ER stress.

Here, we characterize gene expression in murine Dicer-null adult mesenchymal stem cell lines, a fibroblast cell type.  Loss of Dicer leads to de-repression of let-7 targets at levels that exceed 10-100 fold with increases in transcription.  Direct and indirect targets of this miRNA belong to a mid-gestation embryonic program that encompasses known oncofetal genes as well as oncogenes not previously associated with an embryonic state.  Surprisingly, this mid-gestation program represents a distinct period that occurs between the pluripotent state of the inner cell mass at embryonic day 3.5 and the induction of let-7, upon differentiation, at embryonic day 10.5.  Within this mid-gestation program, we characterize the let-7 target Nr6a1, an embryonic transcriptional repressor that regulates gene expression in adult fibroblasts following miRNA loss.  In total, let-7 is required for the continual suppression of embryonic gene expression in adult cells, a mechanism that may underlie its tumor suppressive function. mRNAs from Flag-HA-NR6A1-overexpressing Dicer wild-type adult mesenchymal stem cells (immortalized monoclonal lines of murine MSCs) and vector-only Dicer WT MSCs were analyzed. .. murine MSC cell line;  Dicer f/f;  polyA RNA;  Dicer f/f murine MSC cell line;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Two independent clones of immortalized Dicer WT MSCs (Clone 6 and Clone 12) were infected with puromycin-resistant pMMP-puro retrovirus encoding vector control or Flag-HA-NR6A1.;

The molecular pathways that sense and regulate surfactant pool size within the alveolus have not been identified and constitute a fundamental knowledge gap in the field. Our data show that mice with a germline mutation in the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR116, have a 30-fold accumulation of surfactant phospholipids that causes respiratory distress in adult animals. This phenotype is associated with increased surfactant secretion and induction of the purinergic receptor P2RY2 in young animals, and lipid-laden macrophages and alveolar destruction in older animals. We further demonstrate that GPR116 mRNA expression is developmentally regulated in the murine lung with peak expression at birth when surfactant pool sizes are maximal. Within the lung, GPR116 protein expression is restricted to the apical plasma membrane of alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells. To better understand the roles and molecular mechanisms by which Gpr116 influences gene expression in lung, the effect of cell-selective deletion of Gpr116 (Gpr116D/D) on genome-wide mRNA expression profiles was determined in murine type II alveolar epithelial cells.

However, it has been unclear whether regulatory rules deduced on model genes apply generally to activities of SR proteins in the cell. Here, we report global analyses of two prototypical SR proteins SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) and SRSF2 (SC35) using splicing-sensitive arrays and CLIP-seq on mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Unexpectedly, we find that these SR proteins promote both inclusion and skipping of exons in vivo, but their binding patterns do not explain such opposite responses. Further analyses reveal that loss of one SR protein is accompanied by coordinated loss or compensatory gain in the interaction of other SR proteins at the affected exons. Therefore, specific effects on regulated splicing by one SR protein actually depend on a complex set of relationships with multiple other SR proteins in mammalian genomes.

Here, we analyse the methylome of APCM in mouse intestinal adenoma as a model of intestinal cancer initiation, and inventory a map of over 13,000 adenoma-specific recurrent differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We find that multiple genes coding for Polycomb proteins are upregulated in adenoma, and concomitantly, hypermethylated DMRs form preferentially at Polycomb target sites. We establish that DMRs are absent from proliferating intestinal epithelial cells or intestinal stem cells, and thus arise de novo after loss of APC. Importantly, a core set of DMRs is conserved in human colon cancer, defining a class of early epigenetic alterations that are distinct from known sets of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressors. The data presented suggests a sequence of events that leads to an altered methylome of colon cancer cells, and may allow more specific selection of clinical epigenetic biomarkers.

This can be of particular importance in cardiac regenerative medicine wherein the heart lacks the capacity to heal itself, but simultaneously contains a large pool of fibroblasts. In this study we determined the cardio-inducing capacity of ten transcription factors to actuate cellular reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Over-expression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 significantly enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C. In particular, combinations of five or seven transcription factors significantly enhanced the activation of cardiac reporter vectors, and induced an upregulation of cardiac-specific genes. Global gene expression analysis also demonstrated a significantly greater cardio-inducing effect when the transcription factors MYOCD and SRF were used. Detection of cross-striated cells was highly dependent on the cell culture conditions and was enhanced by the addition of valproic acid and JAK inhibitor. Although we detected Ca2+ transient oscillations in the reprogrammed cells, we did not detect significant changes in resting membrane potential or spontaneously contracting cells. This study further elucidates the cardio-inducing effect of the transcriptional networks involved in cardiac cellular reprogramming, contributing to the ongoing rational design of a robust protocol required for cardiac regenerative therapies.

Mammalian transposon-silencing piRNAs accumulate early in spermatogenesis, whereas pachytene piRNAs are produced later during post-natal spermatogenesis and account for >95% of all piRNAs in the adult mouse testis. Mutants defective for pachytene piRNA pathway proteins fail to produce mature sperm, but neither the piRNA precursor transcripts nor the trigger for pachytene piRNA production is known. Here, we show that the transcription factor A-MYB initiates pachytene piRNA production. A-MYB drives transcription of both pachytene piRNA precursor RNAs and the mRNAs for core piRNA biogenesis factors, including MIWI, the protein through which pachytene piRNAs function. A-MYB regulation of piRNA pathway proteins and piRNA genes creates a coherent feed-forward loop that ensures the robust accumulation of pachytene piRNAs.

In addition to inducing hematological responses in most MPN patients, IFNa reduces the JAK2V617F allelic burden and can render the JAK2V617F mutant clone undetectable in some patients. The precise mechanism underlying these responses is incompletely understood and whether the molecular responses that are seen occur due to the effects of IFNa on JAK2V617F mutant stem cells is debated. Using a murine model of Jak2V617F MPN, we investigated the effects of IFNa on Jak2V617F MPN-propagating stem cells in vivo. We report that IFNa treatment induces hematological responses in the model and causes depletion of Jak2V617F MPN-propagating cells over time, impairing disease transplantation. We demonstrate that IFNa treatment induces cell-cycle activation of Jak2V617F mutant long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC) and promotes a predetermined erythroid-lineage differentiation program. These findings provide insights into the differential effects of IFNa on Jak2V617F mutant and normal hematopoiesis and suggest that IFNa achieves molecular remissions in MPN patients through its effects on MPN stem cells. Furthermore, these results support combinatorial therapeutic approaches in MPN, by concurrently depleting dormant JAK2V617F MPN-propagating stem cells with IFNa and targeting the proliferating downstream progeny with JAK2-inhibitors or cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Using this novel technology, we show that CG methylation enhanced binding for CEBPA and CEBPB and inhibited binding for CREB, ATF4, JUN, JUND, CEBPD and CEBPG.  The CEBPB ATF4 heterodimer bound a novel motif CGAT GCAA 10-fold better when methylated.  EMSA confirmed these results.  CEBPB ChIP-seq data using primary female mouse dermal fibroblasts with 50X methylome coverage for each strand indicate that the methylated sequences well-bound on the arrays are also bound in vivo.  CEBPB bound 39% of the methylated canonical 10-mers ATTGC GCAAT in the mouse genome.  After ATF4 protein induction by thapsigargin which results in ER stress, CEBPB binds methylated CGAT GCAA in vivo, recapitulating what was observed on the arrays.  mRNA-seq of primary female mouse dermal fibroblasts with and without thapsigargin identified differentially expressed genes.  Genes that are commonly bound by CEBPB and ATF4 to TGAT GCAA (the best-bound 8-mer in the array) at the promoters were highly expressed and up-regulated or remained unchanged in the thapsigargin treated primary female mouse dermal fibroblasts.

Global gene expression analysis of these archival tissues has the potential to greatly advance research attempting to link perturbations in molecular pathways to disease outcome. We investigated 16-year-old FFPE mouse liver samples treated with phenobarbital and created a protocol for their analysis using Agilent gene expression arrays. Despite low quality RNA, archival phenobarbital samples exhibited strong induction of the positive control genes CYP2b9 and CYP2b10 by RT-PCR. We hybridized Universal Linkage System   labelled cDNA libraries to 8x60K Agilent gene expression arrays. We compared one- and two-colour microarray experiments and tested the effects of increasing the amount of cDNA loaded. Canonical gene responders to phenobarbital treatment were measurably induced under each experimental condition (however increasing cDNA input also increased the array background signal). Individual genes were validated by RT-PCR and literature searches, and pathway analysis demonstrated that 9/10 top canonical pathways were consistent across experiments. These analyses suggested that future experiments should be done in duplicate to identify and eliminate false positive genes. We conclude that FFPE samples can be used for meaningful and reproducible gene expression and pathway analyses using microarrays.

However, the specific involvement of the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channel in these hippocampus-dependent types of learning and memory remains unclear. To investigate the functional role of the 1H channel in learning and memory, we subjected Cav3.2 homozygous, heterozygous knockout and their wild-type littermates to hippocampus-dependent behavioral tasks, including trace fear conditioning (TFC), the Morris water-maze and passive avoidance. The Cav3.2-/- mice performed normally in the Morris water-maze and auditory trace fear conditioning tasks but were impaired in the context-cued trace fear conditioning, step-down and step-through passive avoidance tasks. Furthermore, long-term potentiation (LTP) could be induced for 180 minutes in hippocampal slices of WTs and Cav3.2+/- mice, whereas LTP persisted for only 120 minutes in Cav3.2-/- mice. To determine whether the hippocampal formation is responsible for the impaired behavioral phenotypes , we next performed experiments locally knock down function of the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channel in the hippocampus. Wild-type mice infused with mibefradil exhibited similar behaviors as homozygous knockouts. Finally, microarray analyses indicated that Cav3.2-/- and WT mice presented distinct hippocampal transcriptome profiles. Taken together, our results demonstrate that retrieval of context-associated memory is dependent on the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channel. After WT and Cav3.2 KO mice retrieval of context-associated memory, three right hippocampi of each group were dissected, pooled together and homogenized. The products of experimental and naive groups were used to acquire expression profiles of a total of 29,922 unique genes.

While overexpression of deltaNp63alpha has been reported in squamous cell cancers, the contribution of p63 to cancer pathogenesis remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that overexpressed deltaNp63alpha aberrantly maintains proliferation of primary epidermal keratinocytes under conditions that normally induce growth arrest and differentiation. To identify target genes impacted by dysregulated deltaNp63alpha that may contribute to squamous cancer development and progression, microarray analyses were performed. Herein we report that elevated deltaNp63alpha differentially regulates genes in primary mouse keratinocytes involved in a variety of cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation, differentiation, skin barrier formation and function, apoptosis, host defense/inflammation, adhesion, migration and invasion. Of note, multiple protease inhibitor mRNAs were coordinately downregulated under both proliferating and differentiating culture conditions. These downregulated genes include two serine protease inhibitors: maspin (serpinB5) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2; serpinB2), as well as a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3). Correspondingly, secreted levels of TIMP-3 and PAI-2 protein declined in the presence of dysregulated deltaNp63alpha, while secreted maspin protein levels remained stable. Intracellular maspin protein expression decreased in response to overexpressed deltaNp63alpha, as did intracellular PAI-2. Unlike PAI-2 and maspin, TIMP-3 protein was not detected intracellularly in control or deltaNp63alpha-overexpressing keratinocytes, supporting a solely extracellular function for TIMP-3. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a p53/p63 consensus DNA binding sequence from the maspin promoter revealed binding of an endogenous transcription factor(s) to the consensus sequence in normal keratinocytes that was disrupted by overexpressed deltaNp63alpha. This binding was also interrupted by the addition of a p73 antibody, but not antibodies to p63 or p53, and was absent in samples derived from p73(-/-) keratinocytes, confirming p73 as a constituent of the endogenous transcription factor complex. These data suggest protease inhibitors as novel targets of dysregulated deltaNp63alpha in cancer pathogenesis. Keratinocytes were transduced with adenoviruses encoding deltaNp63alpha. Keratinocytes were either maintained in low calcium conditions (0.05 mM for 24 hours) (n=6) or high calcium conditions (0.12 mM for 24 hours) (n=6). Control samples consisted of keratinocytes transduced with adenoviruses encoding beta-galactosidase also treated with low calcium (n=6) and high calcium (n=6) conditions. Twelve technical repeat microarray experiments were conducted, pairing high-calcium deltaNp63alpha samples with high-calcium beta-galactosidase samples (n=6) and low-calcium deltaNp63alpha samples with low-calcium beta-galactosidase samples (n=6).

Following activation, T cells up-regulate a host of other membrane-bound costimulatory molecules which can either promote or inhibit further T cell maturation and proliferation.  In some cases, it is necessary to attenuate T cell activation to prevent deleterious inflammation, and inhibitory members of the B7/Butyrophilin family of ligands have evolved to balance the strong stimuli the activating B7 ligands confer.  Human genetic association and in vitro studies have implicated one such ligand, BTNL2, in controlling inflammation at mucosal surfaces.  Here we show that  recombinant mouse BTNL2 modifies B7/CD28 signaling to promote expression of Foxp3, a transcription factor necessary for murine Treg development and function.  BTNL2 blocks Akt-mediated inactivation of Foxo1, a transcription factor necessary for Foxp3 expression.  Immunophenotyping and gene profiling reveal that BTNL2-induced Treg share many properties with natural Treg, and in vivo they suppress enteritis induced by mouse  effector T cells.  These findings describe a mechanism by which environmental antigen-driven formation of Treg may be orchestrated by APC expressing specific modulators of costimulatory signals.

This suppressed hepatic glucose uptake but not glucose output. In the fasted state, expression of carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) and its glycolytic and lipogenic target genes was abnormally elevated. Feeding, energy expenditure, and insulin sensitivity were identical in LG2KO and control mice. Glucose tolerance was normal early after Glut2 inactivation but intolerance developed at later time. This was caused by progressive impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion even though beta-cell mass and insulin content remained normal. Liver transcript profiling revealed a coordinate down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in LG2KO mice. This was associated with reduced hepatic cholesterol in fasted mice and a 30 percent reduction in bile acid production. We showed that chronic bile acids or FXR agonist treatment of primary islets increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, an effect not seen in islets from fxr-/- mice. Collectively, our data show that glucose sensing by the liver controls beta-cell glucose competence, through a mechanism that likely depends on bile acid production and action on beta-cells. three replicates each of ps_ctrl_refed, ps_tamox_refed, ps_ctrl_fasted, ps_tamox_fasted .. fasted;  fasted/refed;  LG2KO;  control;  total RNA;  Liver RNA from fasted control mouse;  Liver RNA from fasted/refed LG2KO (tamoxifen treated) mouse;  Liver RNA from fasted/refed control mouse;  SV129XC57Bl/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;

To understand the immediate and adaptive response of primary murine hematopoietic cells to the transcriptional upregulation of Evi1, we developed an inducible lentiviral vector system with a robust expression switch. We found that Evi1 delays differentiation and promotes survival in myeloid culture conditions, orchestrating a battery of genes involved in stemness (Aldh1a1, Ly6a [Sca1], Abca1, Epcam, among others). Importantly, Evi1 suppresses Cyclins and Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), while it upregulates Cdk inhibitors, inducing quiescence in various proliferation-inducing cytokine conditions and operating in a strictly dose-dependent manner. Hematopoietic cells with persisting Evi1-induction tend to adopt a relatively low expression level. We thus classify Evi1 as a dormancy-inducing oncogene, likely requiring epigenetic and genetic compensation for cell expansion and malignant progression.

Here, we show that dysbiosis coupled to Nod2 or Rip2 deficiency suffices to cause an increased risk for intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated carcinogenesis in mice. Aggravated epithelial lesions and dysplasia upon chemical-induced injury associated with loss of Nod2 or Rip2 can be prevented by antibiotics or anti-IL6R treatment. Nod2-mediated risk for intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated tumorigenesis is communicable through maternally-transmitted microbiota even to wild-type hosts.

To test epigenetic therapy against this cancer we used the DNA demethylating drug 5-aza-2   -deoxycytidine (DAC) in a KrasLSL-G12D; p53LSL-R270H/+; Pdx1-cre; Brca1flex2/flex2 (KPC-Brca1) mouse model of aggressive stroma-rich PDAC.  In untreated tumors, we found globally decreased 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC) in malignant epithelial cells and in cancer-associated myofibroblasts (CAFs), and increased amounts of 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5HmC) in CAFs, in progression from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) to PDAC.  DAC further reduced DNA methylation and slowed PDAC progression, markedly extending survival in an early treatment protocol and significantly though transiently inhibiting tumor growth when initiated later, without adverse side effects.  Escaping tumors contained areas of sarcomatoid transformation with disappearance of CAFs.  Mixing-allografting experiments and proliferation indices showed that DAC efficacy was due to inhibition of both the malignant epithelial cells and the stromal CAFs.  Expression profiling and immunohistochemistry highlighted DAC-induction of STAT1 in the tumors, and DAC plus gamma-interferon produced an additive anti-proliferative effect on PDAC cells.  DAC induced strong expression of the testis antigen DAZL in CAFs.  These data show that DAC is effective against PDAC in vivo and provide a rationale for future studies combining hypomethylating agents with cytokines and immunotherapy.

However, the role of Dkk1 in the oncogenesis of primary osteosarcoma (OS) remains unexplored. Here, we over-expressed Dkk1 in the OS cell line MOS-J. Contrary to expectations, Dkk1 had autocrine effects on MOSJ cells in that it increased proliferation and resistance to metabolic stress in vitro. In vivo, Dkk1 expressing MOS-J cells formed larger and more destructive tumors than controls.   These effects were attributed in part to up-regulation of the stress response enzyme and cancer stem cell marker aldehyde-dehydrogenase-1 (ALDH1) through Jun-N-terminal kinase signaling. This is the first report linking Dkk1 to tumor stress resistance, further supporting the targeting of Dkk1 not only to prevent and treat osteolytic bone lesions but also to reduce numbers of stress-resistant tumor cells.

Conversely, CDX2 acts as a tumor suppressor in colonic epithelium. The effectors mediating the leukemogenic activity of CDX2 and the mechanism underlying its context-dependent properties are poorly characterized, and strategies for interfering with CDX2 function in AML remain elusive. We report data implicating repression of the transcription factor KLF4 as important for the oncogenic activity of CDX2, and demonstrate that CDX2 differentially regulates KLF4 in AML versus colon cancer cells through a mechanism that involves tissue-specific patterns of promoter binding and epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, we identified deregulation of the PPAR   signaling pathway as a feature of AML expressing CDX2, and observed that PPAR   agonists derepress KLF4 and are preferentially toxic to CDX2-positive leukemic cells. These data delineate transcriptional programs associated with CDX2 expression in hematopoietic cells; provide insight into the antagonistic duality of CDX2 function in AML versus colon cancer; and suggest reactivation of KLF4 expression, through modulation of PPAR   signaling, as a new therapeutic modality in a large proportion of AML patients. Experiment 1 (Samples 1-6): The transcriptional changes induced by Cdx2 were assessed ex vivo in primary murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

Lineage-depleted cells were stained with APC-conjugated anti-c-Kit and PE-Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rat antibodies, and c-Kit+ Lin    cells were sorted using a BD FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences).

The pRb relative, p107, compensates some of the functions of pRb in these tissues, however RbF/F;K14cre;p107-/- mice die postnatally. Acute pRb loss in stratified epithelia, using an inducible mouse model (RbF/F;K14creERTM), shows that p107 exerts specific tumor suppressor functions in its absence. After simultaneous absence of pRb and p107, p53 transcriptional function is impaired and Pten expression is reduced. All mutant mice develop spontaneous squamous tumors carcinomas rapidly. Gene expression analysis of mouse tumors, besides supporting the impaired p53 function and the susceptibility to Akt/mTOR inhibitors, also revealed significant overlap with human squamous carcinomas. Thus, RbF/F;K14creERTM;p107-/- may constitute a new mouse model for these malignancies. Collectively, these data demonstrate the existence of a previously unreported functional connection between pRb, Pten and p53 tumor suppressors, through p107, of a particular relevance in squamous tumor development.

ES cell differentiation was used to recapitulate the developmental onset of Airn and Igf2r imprinted expression and polyA cassettes inserted before (T3, T16, T27) or after (T31, T51) the Igf2r promoter successfully truncated Airn, with the exception of T27.

Since microRNAs are regulated by growth signals, we sought to determine if microRNAs could also be regulated by nutrient availability.  We found that several microRNAs change expression following glucose starvation and that their Ago2 occupancy remains constant. Immortalized Bax/Bak double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were deprived of glucose for 5 days and then re-fed glucose for 2 days.

Lats1 and Lats2 kinases share 85% sequence identity in the kinase domain. However, their non-kinase regions at the N-terminus are distinct except for Lats conserved domain 1 (LCD1) and LCD2, suggesting that their N-terminal regions are important for Lats1/2-specific functions. In this study, we generated Lats1 knockout mice disrupting the N-terminal region containing LCD1 (Lats1  N/  N). We show that some Lats1  N/  N mice were born safely and grew normally. However, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Lats1  N/  N mice displayed drastic defects in mitosis, showing enhanced centrosome overduplication, chromosomal misalignment, multipolar spindle formation, chromosome bridging, and cytokinesis failure. Moreover, they displayed accelerated cell cycle and cell growth bypassing a cell-cell contact inhibition like tumor cells, and exhibited anchorage independent growth. Indeed, Lats1  N/  N MEFs produced tumors in nude mice after subcutaneous injection, although the tumor growth rate was much slower than ordinary cancer cells.

After identifying the profiles of differentially expressed genes observed for each comparison, we carried out functional enrichment analysis to reveal transcripts putatively involved in potential relevant biological processes and signaling pathways. The most relevant enriched biological processes found in these comparisons were stress, inflammation, apoptosis, pathways in cancer, differentiation, angiogenesis, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, ion transport, angiogenesis, mitosis and cell cycle, inflammatory response, olfactory transduction and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. In addition, the most important overrepresented pathways were MAPK, ErbB, JAK/STAT, Toll and Nod like receptors, Angiotensin II, Arachidonic acid metabolism, Wnt and coagulation cascade. Also, new insights were gained about the underlying protection mechanisms against renal IRI promoted by IPC and Hemin treatment. Venn diagram analysis allowed us to uncover common and exclusively differentially expressed genes between these two protective maneuvers, underscoring potential common and exclusive biological functions regulated in each case. In summary, IPC exclusively regulated the expression of genes belonging to stress, protein modification and apoptosis, highlighting the role of IPC in controlling exacerbated stress response. Treatment with the Hmox1 inducer Hemin, in turn, exclusively regulated the expression of genes associated with cell differentiation, metabolic pathways, cell cycle, mitosis, development, regulation of actin cytoskeleton and arachidonic acid metabolism, suggesting a pleiotropic effect for Hemin. According to surgery and treatment procedures, mices were divided into five groups: Control, Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), animals pre-treated with Hemin followed by IRI (Hemin + IRI), animals only treated with Hemin (Hemin) and animals pre-conditioned and submitted to IRI (IPC+IRI).

Here, we investigated the role of the nucleoprotein Geminin in regulating neurogenesis at a mechanistic level during both Xenopus primary neurogenesis and mammalian neuronal differentiation in vitro. The latter work utilized both neural cells derived from embryonic stem and embryonal carcinoma cells in vitro and neural stem cells from mouse forebrain. In all of these contexts, Geminin antagonized the ability of neural bHLH transcription factors to activate transcriptional programs promoting neurogenesis. Furthermore, Geminin promoted a bivalent chromatin state, characterized by the presence of both activating and repressive histone modifications, at genes encoding transcription factors that promote neurogenesis. This epigenetic state restrains the expression of genes that regulate commitment of undifferentiated stem and neuronal precursor cells to neuronal lineages. Geminin is highly expressed in undifferentiated neuronal precursor cells but is downregulated prior to differentiation. Therefore, these data support a model whereby Geminin promotes the neuronal precursor cell state by modulating both the epigenetic status and expression of genes encoding neurogenesis-promoting factors. Additional developmental signals acting in these cells can then control their transition toward terminal neuronal or glial differentiation during mammalian neurogenesis. A mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line for inducible knockdown of the small nucleoprotein Geminin was utilized. ES cells were used to generate neural precursor cells by monolayer culture in N2B27 media for 5 days, and doxycycline-inducible knockdown of Geminin was performed from day 3. Changes in gene expression resulting from Geminin knockdown were assessed by RNA sequencing. Three experimental replicates were generated for Geminin knockdown (plus Dox) with a corresponding no-Dox control. These were subjected to sequencing, and data were analyzed using TopHat and Cufflinks/Cuffdiff. Transcripts were considered as differentially expressed upon Gem knockdown if data met statistical significance cutoffs in Cuffdiff (sufficient sequence alignments were obtained for analysis and transcript had significant change in FPKM value (normalized transcript abundance; fragments per kb of exon per million fragments mapped) between the no Dox and plus Dox sample pairs) in at least two of the three replicates. .. embryonic stem cell-derived neural precursors;  A2lox;  ACAGATA;  CTCAATG;  GAGTACG;  GTATTTG;  total RNA;  neural progenitors derived from mouse embryonic stem cells, Geminin knockdown;  neural progenitors derived from mouse embryonic stem cells, control;  10090;  Mus musculus;  no Dox;  plus Dox;  ES cells enabling doxycycline-dependent Geminin knockdown (described previously, Yellajoshyula et al., PNAS 108(8), pg. 329) were treated with 500ng doxycycline from day 3 to day 5 of neuronal differentiation in N2B27 medium.

The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing kidney. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in FACS isolated components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. YFP & GFP transgenic lines have been used to isolate several cell types including the metanephric mesenchyme, Juxtaglomerular Complex cells or renal cortex from the kidneys of either E11.5 embryos or adult mice.

Here, the mechanism of neutrophil abscess formation was investigated using a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infection. Gene expression analysis of S. aureus-infected skin revealed that induction of neutrophil recruitment genes was largely dependent upon IL-1beta/IL-1R activation. Unexpectedly, using IL 1beta reporter mice, neutrophils were identified as the primary source of IL-1beta at the site of infection. Furthermore, IL-1beta-producing neutrophils were necessary and sufficient for abscess formation and bacterial clearance. S. aureus-induced IL 1beta production by neutrophils required TLR2, NOD2, FPRs and the ASC/NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, IL-1beta and neutrophil abscess formation during an infection are functionally, spatially and temporally linked as a consequence of direct IL-1beta production by neutrophils.

Here, we reveal that an essential impact of this process is the protection of cellular gene expression in early embryos from perturbation by cis-acting activators contained within these genetic invaders. In TRIM28-depleted ES cells, repressive chromatin marks at ERVs are replaced by histone modifications typical of active enhancers, stimulating transcription of nearby cellular genes, notably those harboring bivalent promoters. Correspondingly, ERV-derived sequences can repress or enhance expression from an adjacent promoter in transgenic embryos depending on their TRIM28-sensitivity in ES cells. TRIM28-mediated control of ERVs is therefore crucial not just to prevent retrotransposition, but more broadly to safeguard the transcriptional dynamics of early embryos.

We have investigated whether chromatin remodeling could provide protection against autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Treatment of female mice during the transition from prediabetic to diabetic stage (18-24 weeks of age) with the well-characterized histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA) effectively reduced the incidence of diabetes and abrogated the ability of splenocytes to adoptively transfer the disease into immunodeficient NOD.scid mice. Protection against diabetes was accompanied by histone hyperacetylation in pancreas and spleen, increased frequency of CD4+ CD62L+ cells in the spleen, reduction in cellular infiltration of islets, restoration of normoglycemia and glucose-induced insulin release by beta cells. In vitro activation of splenic T lymphocytes derived from protected mice resulted in enhanced expression of IFN-gamma mRNA and protein without altering the expression of Il4, Il17, Il18, Inos, and Tnfa genes nor the secretion of IL-2, IL-4, IL-17 and TNF-alpha proteins. Consistently, expression of the transcription factor involved in Ifng transcription, Tbet/Tbx21 but not Gata3 and Rorgt, respectively required for the transcription of Il4 and Il17, was upregulated in activated splenocytes of protected mice. These data indicate that abrogation of autoimmune diabetes is associated with the selective upregulation of certain inducible genes in T lymphocytes. Microarray analysis was performed to determine the changes in global gene expression underlying abrogation of autoimmune diabetes by TSA-mediated epigenetic modulation and identified a distinct group of genes down-regulated during this process. Female NOD mice were treated subcutaneously with TSA (500   g/Kg body weight) during the transition from prediabetic to diabetic stage (18-24 weeks of age), at weekly intervals. Since we sought to determine the modulation of global gene expression associated with long-term protection against diabetes, TSA treated mice were killed between 32 and 36 weeks of age and total RNA was extracted from uninduced splenocytes. RNA was also extracted from splenocytes of untreated mice that became diabetic and those that did not develop diabetes till 36 weeks of age. Blood glucose levels were determined weekly to monitor the glycemic condition in untreated and TSA-treated mice. To minimize the variability in gene expression among individual mice, RNA was extracted from splenocytes of 3 to 5 mice per group and pooled.

Despite finding that PDA-bearing mice had cancer cell-specific CD8+ T cells, the mice, like human PDA patients, did not respond to two immunological checkpoint antagonists that promote the function of T cells,   -CTLA-4 and   -PD-L1. Immune control of PDA growth was achieved, however, by depleting carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that express Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP).  The depletion of the FAP+ stromal cell also uncovered the anti-tumor effects of   -CTLA-4 and   -PD-L1, indicating that its immune suppressive activity accounts for the failure of these T cell checkpoint antagonists. Three findings suggested that CXCL12 explained the overriding immunosuppression by the FAP+ cell: T cells were absent from regions of the tumor containing cancer cells; cancer cells were coated with the chemokine, CXCL12; and the FAP+ CAF was the principle source of CXCL12 in the tumor. Administering AMD3100, a CXCL12 receptor (CXCR4) inhibitor, induced rapid T cell accumulation among cancer cells, and acted synergistically with   -PD-L1 to selectively and greatly diminish cancer cells, identified by their loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of Trp53. The residual tumor was comprised only of pre-malignant epithelial cells and inflammatory cells.  Thus, a single protein, CXCL12, from a single stromal cell type, the FAP+ CAF, may direct tumor immune evasion in a model of human PDA. FAP+ cells were sorted from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Cells were isolated in duplicate experiments and these were analysed separately. These were compared separately to previously published publicly available CD4+ T-cell subset data (C57BL/6 mice and Foxp3-RFP mice (Line 8374) GEO accession GSE20898), and previously published FAP+ cell datasets (transgenic albino (Tyr-/-) C57BL/6 mouse, GEO accession GSE39438). ..

Most target prediction and discovery relies on perfect complementarity of the miRNA seed to the 3    untranslated region (UTR).  However, it is unclear to what extent miRNAs target sites without seed matches.  Here, we performed a transcriptome-wide identification of the endogenous targets of a single miRNA   miR-155   in a genetically controlled manner.  We found that approximately forty percent of miR-155-dependent Argonaute binding occurs at sites without perfect seed matches.  The majority of these non-canonical sites feature extensive complementarity to the miRNA seed with one mismatch.  These non-canonical sites confer regulation of gene expression albeit less potently than canonical sites.  Thus, non-canonical miRNA binding sites are widespread, often contain seed-like motifs, and can regulate gene expression, generating a continuum of targeting and regulation. We used microarrays to measure changes in gene expression between activated wild type (WT) and miR-155 deficient (155KO) primary CD4 T cells. CD4 T cells were harvested from WT and miR-155 KO mice (Thai et al., 2007) and activated for 3 days in vitro.  Each array is from a separate biological replicate, which are cells originating from a separate mouse. ..

Abnormal neuritic sprouting and synaptic deficits are apparent during pre-clinical disease, however, gross neuronal loss is not detected until the onset of the clinical phase. The molecular events that accompany early neuronal damage and ultimately conclude with neuronal death remain obscure. In this study, we used laser capture microdissection to isolate hippocampal CA1 neurons and then determined their pre-clinical transcriptional response during infection. We found that gene expression within these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases of activity. A major cluster of genes is altered during pre-clinical disease after which expression either returns to basal levels, or alternatively undergoes a direct reversal during clinical disease. Strikingly, we show that this cluster contains a signature highly reminiscent of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor signaling and the activation of neuroprotective pathways. Additionally, genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were also altered throughout the disease, culminating in a general decline of gene expression for synaptic proteins. Similarly, deregulated miRNAs such as miR-132-3p, miR-124a-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-140-5p follow concomitant patterns of expression. This is the first in depth genomic study describing the pre-clinical response of hippocampal neurons to early prion replication. Our findings suggest that prion replication results in the persistent stimulation of a programmed response, at least in part mediated by synaptic NMDA receptor activity that initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodelling. However, this response is terminated prior to the onset of clinical symptoms in the infected hippocampus, seemingly pointing to a critical juncture in the disease. Manipulation of these early neuroprotective pathways may redress the balance between degeneration and survival, providing a potential inroad for treatment. The CA1 hippocampal region was dissected out using LCM and RNA was extracted from these samples.  In total, 6 different time points were screened for both RNA and miRNA expression levels in prion infected and control animals.  Gene expression profiles from 6 time points (n     2) were determined using whole mouse 4x44K arrays.  We successfully validated a subset of candidate genes that were deregulated during early prion disease.  We performed a similar assessment of temporal miRNAs expression levels throughout the infection using the TLDA platform which was further validated by individual real-time PCR assays.  In parallel, immunoctyochemistry was used to characterize the cellular presence of astrocytes, microglial and neurons in the CA1 region throughout the disease which correlated well with both mRNA and miRNA expression profiles.  Staining for the PrPRes and neuronal toxicity levels was also performed to determine the spatial and temporal PrPRes deposition and assess the level of neuronal death that occurs in the hippocampus, respectively.  Using bioinformatic methods, potential pathways that were implicated by our data to be deregulated during early prion disease were presented while potential miRNA regulation of some of these candidate genes implicated in these pathways was also included. ..

We show here that female (XX) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in mice are induced into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs), which, when aggregated with female gonadal somatic cells as reconstituted ovaries, develop pre-meiotic germ cell characteristics, including X-reactivation, imprint erasure, and cyst formation. Upon transplantation under ovarian bursa, PGCLCs in the reconstituted ovaries mature into germinal vesicle-stage oocytes, which, through in vitro maturation and fertilization, contribute to fertile offspring. Our culture system serves as a robust foundation for the investigation of key properties of female germ cells, including the acquisition of totipotency, and for the reconstitution of whole female germ-cell development in vitro.

Obstructive nephropathy is characterized discrete morphological and physiologic changes including tubular dilatation, apoptosis, and atrophy, as well as interstitial cellular infiltration and progressive interstitial fibrosis. We hypothesize that there are gene expression alterations correlated with obstructive nephropathy that could serve as biomarkers for early intervention. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to Unilateral Urethral Obstruction (UUO) or sham surgery at postnatal day 21 of life, and kidneys were harvested after 1, 2, 5 and 9 days postoperatively. RNA was extracted from kidneys and comprehensive gene expression profiling was performed with Agilent microarrays. We used biological replicates: 13 UUO replicates, 9 sham replicates. 2-Channel microarrays were hybridized using universal reference in the Cy3 channel. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to analyze the biological function and gene networks of gene expression data. RESULTS: Microarray analysis revealed more than 1800 transcripts that were up- or down-regulated over days 1 through 9 following obstruction, and included many transcripts reported previously (FOS, CD44, CLU, SPP1 and EGF). Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of transcripts in cell activation/differentiation, immune/inflammatory responses, cell cycle, metabolic process and transport. Interestingly, IPA network analysis showed that transcriptional regulatory pathway involving CEBPB/HNF4A is involved in obstructive nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Transcript profiling identified numerous gene expression changes following UUO and suggests a role for CEBPB/HNF4A pathway in obstructive nephropathy. This dataset provides a foundation for development of biomarkers for obstructive nephropathy.

Cell type and protein specific binding preferences of transcription factors to sites with either low (e.g. Myc, Klf4, Zfx) or high (e.g. Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2) nucleosome occupancy as well as complex patterns for CTCF were identified. Nucleosome depleted regions around transcription start and termination sites were broad and more pronounced for active genes, with distinct patterns for promoters classified according to their CpG-content or histone methylation marks. Throughout the genome nucleosome occupancy was dependent on the presence of certain histone methylation or acetylation modifications. In addition, the average nucleosome-repeat length increased during differentiation by 5-7 base pairs, with local variations for specific genomic regions. Our results reveal regulatory mechanisms of cell differentiation acting through nucleosome repositioning. The Total RNA from ESCs, NPCs and MEFs was extracted by guanidinisothiocyanat/phenol extraction with the Trifast kit (Peqlab). Total RNA preparations were treated with DNase I, phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated before further processing. RNAs were depleted of 5S, 5.8S, 18S and 28S rRNAs using the Human/Mouse/Rat Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre) according to the manufacturer   s protocol. After rRNA depletion, RNAs were fragmented with a kit from Ambion. Libraries for Solexa sequencing were generated according to the standard Illumina protocol that comprised first strand cDNA synthesis, second strand cDNA synthesis, end repair, addition of a single A base, and adapter ligation. Sequencing was performed on the  Illumina GAIIx (replicate 1) and Illumina HiSeq 2000 (replicate 2) platforms at the sequencing core facilities of the BioQuant in Heidelberg, Germany. RNA reads were aligned with TopHat. Further expression analysis was with the Genomatix software suite (Genomatix, Munich, Germany) and the Eldorado gene annotation. For each transcript a normalized expression value was calculated from the read distribution that accounts for the length differences using the program DEseq for the analysis of differential expression. ..

To test the efficacy of targeting D-cyclins in cancer treatment, we engineered mouse strains which allow acute and global ablation of individual D-cyclins in a living animal. Ubiquitous shutdown of cyclin D1 or inhibition of cyclin D associated kinase activity in mice bearing ErbB2-driven mammary carcinomas halted cancer progression and triggered tumor-specific senescence, without compromising the animals' health. Ablation of cyclin D3 in mice bearing T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) triggered tumorspecific apoptosis. Such selective killing of leukemic cells can be also achieved by inhibiting cyclin D associated kinase activity in mouse and human T-ALL models. Hence, contrary to what one might expect from ablation of a cell cycle protein, acute shutdown of a D-cyclin leads not only to cell cycle arrest, but it also triggers tumor cell senescence or apoptosis, and it affects different tumor types through distinct cellular mechanisms. Inhibiting cyclin D-activity represents a highly-selective anticancer strategy which specifically targets cancer cells without significantly affecting normal tissues.

Therefore, we aimed to identify and characterize alterations in gene expression in the acutely inflamed ileum of two murine models of intestinal inflammation, namely intestinal schistosomiasis and TNBS-induced ileitis, using Agilent whole-genome microarrays followed by bioinformatics analysis to detect enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and Gene Ontology categories.  Results: When compared with healthy control mice, of almost all known mouse genes and transcripts represented on the array, intestinal schistosomiasis and TNBS-induced ileitis yielded 207 and 1417 differential genes respectively, with 48 overlapping genes (adj.p.value<0.1 and log2FC>1 or <1). Complement and coagulation cascades, extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, Fc epsilon receptor I signaling pathways and protein activation cascade, cell adhesion categories were enriched for differential genes in intestinal schistosomiasis. Antigen processing and presentation, cell adhesion molecules, ABC transporters, Toll-like receptor signaling pathways and response to chemical stimulus categories were enriched for differential genes in TNBS-induced ileitis. Although cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, intestinal immune network for immunoglobulin A production, focal adhesion pathways and immune, inflammatory and defense response categories were enriched for differential genes in both inflammation models, the vast majority of the associated differential genes were unique to each model.  Conclusions: This study characterized the two diverse models of ileal inflammation at a whole-genome level and outlined their underlying molecular heterogeneity. The results indicate that intestinal schistosomiasis involves Th2 responses, enhanced tissue repair and complement activation, while TNBS-induced ileitis involves Th17 responses, defective antigen processing and presentation and altered Toll-like receptor-mediated responses. Epithelial barrier impairment seems to occur in both inflammation models. Moreover, the comprehensive differential gene-list provided by this study would be helpful as a starting point to explore a specific novel pathway in more detail dealing with small bowel inflammation.

To study the regulation and functions of T-bet, we developed a T-bet-ZsGreen reporter mouse strain, in which GFP faithfully reflects the expression of T-bet.  By using this tool, we report that signals elicited by IL-12 and IFNg are redundant in inducing T-bet in mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii and that T-bet does not contribute to its own expression when induced by IL-12 and IFNg. While both T-bet and Stat4 are critical for IFNg production, IFNg signaling is dispensable.  Strikingly, loss of T-bet results in activation of an endogenous Th2 program in cells expressing T-bet-ZsGreen. Genome-wide analyses suggest T-bet directly induces Th1-related genes but indirectly suppresses Th2-related genes. Our study revealed redundancy and synergy among several Th1-inducing pathways in regulating the expression of T-bet and IFNg, and a critical role of T-bet in suppressing an endogenous Th2 program.

Whether target tissue CD40 expression plays a role in autoimmune disease etiology has yet to be determined. Here we show for the first time, that target-tissue over-expression of CD40 plays a key role in the etiology of autoimmunity. Using a murine model of GD, we demonstrated that thyroidal CD40 over-expression augmented the production of thyroid specific antibodies, resulting in more severe experimental autoimmune Graves    disease (EAGD), whereas deletion of thyroidal CD40 suppressed disease. Using transcriptome and immune-pathway analyses we showed that in both EAGD mouse thyroids and human primary thyrocytes, CD40 mediates this effect by activating downstream cytokines and chemokines, most notably IL-6. To translate these findings into therapy, we blocked IL-6 during EAGD induction in the setting of thyroidal CD40 over-expression, and showed decreased levels of TSHR stimulating antibodies and frequency of disease. We conclude that target tissue over-expression of CD40 plays a key role in the etiology of organ specific autoimmune disease. CD40 in Thyroid Autoimmunity: 1) Incubation of human thyroid cells with G28.5, a CD40 stimulating antibody, and purification of RNA, conversion to cDNA, measurement of mRNA expression using RNAseq. 2) Removal of thyroid tissues from CD40 over-expressing transgenic mice and wild type mice, purification of RNA, conversion to cDNA measurement of mRNA expression using RNAseq. .. primary thyroid cell line;  F1H (F1, first generation, H hybrid);  CD40 over-expressing transgenic;  wild type;  developed EAGD;  healthy;  total RNA;  pool of thyroid gland tissues from group;  primary thyroid cell line;  hybrid C57BL/6xBALB/c;  10090;  9606;  Homo sapiens;  Mus musculus;  thyroid gland;  G28.5 treatment (1 ug, 24 hour);  immunized with thyrotropin receptor A subunit cDNA in an adenovirus construct;  no treatment;  Primary thyroid cell cultures were washed with 10ml PBS after 24 hours, and then 10mL of medium [DMEM, 4.0 mM L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic anti-mycotic solution (all from Hyclone/Thermo Fisher Waltham, MA)] were added to the flask.

In contrast, naturally occurring mutations (e.g., P467L, V290M) in the ligand binding domain of PPAR gamma in humans leads to severe insulin resistance and early-onset hypertension. Experimental evidence, including whole genome expression profiling, suggests that these mutant versions of PPAR gamma act in a dominant negative manner. Because PPAR gamma is expressed in a variety of cell types and tissues, we generated a transgenic mouse model (SP467L) specifically targeting dominant negative PPAR gamma to the vascular smooth muscle cells in order to determine the action of PPAR gamma in the blood vessel independent of its systemic metabolic actions.   In the data set provided herein, we examined the gene expression profile in thoracic aorta from SP467L mice and their control littermates using the Affymetrix mouse exon 1.0 ST array. We generated transgenic mice specifically targeting expression of mutant dominant negative human PPAR gamma (P467L) to vascular smooth muscle using a smooth muscle-specific promoter (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain or SMMHC).  Thoracic aortas were isolated from 7 male transgenic  mice and 5 non-transgenic littermate controls. Total RNA was prepared using conventional methods and quality was assessed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). For the microarray hybridizations, each sample corresponded to aorta derived from one mouse. All procedures were conducted at the University of Iowa DNA Core facility using standard Affymetrix protocols. In brief, approximately 50 ng of total RNA was used as input to a two-step amplification procedure (NuGen, http://www.nugeninc.com/) to generate biotin-labeled RNA fragments for hybridization to the Affymetrix mouse exon 1.0 ST array. ..

To examine whether counteracting myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass and a pro-lipofibrotic factor, would help this process, we compared the in vitro myogenic and fibrogenic capacity of MDSC from wild type (WT), myostatin knockout (Mst KO), and mdx (DMD model) (mdx) young mice under various modulators, the expression of key stem cell and myogenic genes, and the capacity of these MDSC to repair the injured gastrocnemius in aged mdx mice with exacerbated lipofibrosis. Surprisingly, the potent in vitro myotube formation by WT MDSC was refractory to modulators of myostatin expression or activity, and the Mst KO and mdx MDSC failed to form myotubes under any condition, despite all MDSC expressed Oct-4 and various stem cell genes and differentiated into other lineages. The genetic inactivation of myostatin or dystrophin in MDSC was associated with silencing of critical genes for early myogenesis (Actc1, Acta1, and MyoD). WT MDSC implanted into the injured gastrocnemius of old mdx mice significantly improved myofiber repair and reduced fat deposition and, to a lesser extent, fibrosis. In contrast to their in vitro behavior, Mst KO MDSC in vivo also significantly improved myofiber repair, but had no significant effects on lipofibrotic degeneration. In conclusion, while WT MDSC are considerably myogenic in culture and stimulate muscle repair after injury in the aged mdx mouse, myostatin genetic inactivation blocks myotube formation in vitro but the myogenic capacity is recovered in vivo under the influence of the host tissue environment, presumably by reactivation of key genes originally silenced in the Mst KO MDSC. Key words: dystrophin, mdx mouse, Duchenne, fibrosis, dystrophy One sample each of mouse wild type (WT), myostatin knockout (KO), muscular dystrophy model mdx, and the transgenic OCT4 promoter plus reporter were grown, RNA was isolated, and subjected to the SABiosciences mouse stem cell oligo array. ..

IRF4 binds DNA weakly owing to a carboxy-terminal auto-inhibitory domain, but cooperative binding with factors such as PU.1 or SPIB in B cells increases binding affinity, allowing IRF4 to regulate genes containing ETS   IRF composite elements (EICEs; 5'-GGAAnnGAAA-3'). Here we show that in mouse CD4+ T cells, where PU.1/SPIB expression is low, and in B cells, where PU.1 is well expressed, IRF4 unexpectedly can cooperate with activator protein-1 (AP1) complexes to bind to AP1   IRF4 composite (5'-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3') motifs that we denote as AP1   IRF composite elements (AICEs). Moreover, BATF   JUN family protein complexes cooperate with IRF4 in binding to AICEs in pre-activated CD4+ T cells stimulated with IL-21 and in TH17 differentiated cells. Importantly, BATF binding was diminished in Irf4-/- T cells and IRF4 binding was diminished in Batf-/- T cells, consistent with functional cooperation between these factors. Moreover, we show that AP1 and IRF complexes cooperatively promote transcription of the Il10 gene, which is expressed in TH17 cells and potently regulated by IL-21. These findings reveal that IRF4 can signal via complexes containing ETS or AP1 motifs depending on the cellular context, thus indicating new approaches for modulating IRF4-dependent transcription. Genome-wide transcription factors mapping and binding of IRF4, BATF, IRF8, STAT3, JUN etc in WT, Irf4-/- and Batf-/- mice in different cell types (B cells, CD4+ T cells and TH17 cells) cultured with or without IL-21 was conducted.

In adult animals, there was a reduction of brain weight by 30% and an almost complete loss of the dorsal dentate gyrus with normal cortical layering. Interestingly, the adult mice showed motor hyperactivity and a selective loss of long-term memory with normal spatial learning. We observed enhanced apoptosis starting from day E10.5. Performing microarray expression analyses and Q-PCR validation with E12.5 forebrain RNA, we observed an over-representation of thalamic markers and an under-representation of cortical markers in transgenic as compared to control animals. Immunohistochemical data show a loss of progenitors in the lateral ventricles. Up-regulation of Pik3ip1 as a target gene of FoxO3 could be responsible for the observed increase in apoptosis. The obtained forebrain expression signature is reminiscent of a Pax6 knockdown phenotype showing that expression of this FoxO3 allele during development affected neural progenitor survival and overall brain development. Conclusion: Neural progenitors are vulnerable to constitutively active FoxO3-induced apoptosis. We sought to determine the transcriptional differences in forebrains from E12.5 mice expressing a constitutively active alleleof FoxO3 under the control of the forebrain-specific CaMKIIa promoter. To this end two time-pregnant dams were sacrificed 12 days after the vaginal plug was detected, and the embryos were prepared. Visual staging of the embryos confirmed their age.

To date, our understanding of mammalian gene regulation has been hampered by the difficulty of directly measuring in vivo binding of large numbers of transcription factors to DNA. Here, we develop a high-throughput indexed Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (iChIP) method coupled to massively parallel sequencing to systematically map protein-DNA interactions. We apply iChIP to reconstruct the physical regulatory landscape of a mammalian cell, by building genome-wide binding maps for 29 transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin marks at four time points following stimulation of primary dendritic cells (DCs) with pathogen components. Using over 180,000 TF-DNA interactions in these maps, we derive an initial dynamic physical model of a mammalian cell regulatory network. Our data demonstrates that transcription factors vary substantially in their binding dynamics, genomic localization, number of binding events, and degree of interaction with other factors. Further, many of the TF-DNA interactions at stimulus-activated genes are established during differentiation and maintained in a poised state. Functionally, the TFs are organized in a hierarchy of different types: Cell differentiation factors bind most of the genes and remain largely unchanged during the stimulation. A second set of TFs bind already in the un-stimulated and preferentially target induced genes. A third set consists of TF that bind mainly after the stimuli and target specific gene functions. Together these factors determine the magnitude and timing of stimulus induced gene expression. Our method, which allowed us to map routinely temporal binding profiles of dozens of TFs, provides a foundation for future understanding of the mammalian regulatory code.

Two seemingly opposite theories have been proposed to explain IFE homeostasis. One posits that IFE is maintained by a long-lived slow-cycling stem cell (SC) population that give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying (TA) cell progeny, while the other suggests that homeostasis is achieved by a single committed progenitor (CP) that balances stochastic fate. Here, we probed the cellular heterogeneity within the IFE using two different inducible CREER targeting IFE progenitors. Quantitative analysis of clonal fate data and proliferation dynamics demonstrate the existence of two distinct proliferative cell compartments composed of slow-cycling SC and CP, both of which undergo population asymmetric self-renewal. However, following wounding, only SCs contribute substantially to the repair and long-term regeneration of the tissue, while CP cells make a minimal and transient contribution. Transcriptional profile of InvCREER/RosaYFP and K14CREER/RosaYFP targeted FACS-isolated alpha6 integrin-high CD34-neg basal cells from mouse tail epidermis.Skin epidermis was removed from tail bone and incubated overnight in HBSS (Gibco) 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) at 4  C. Epidermis was separated from the dermis and incubated on a rocking plate (100 rpm) at room temperature for 5 min. Basal cells were mechanically separated from the epidermis by flushing 10 times under the epidermis. Tissues were then cut in pieces of 1 mm2 with scalpel, and trypsin was neutralized by adding DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% Chelex Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). Samples were filtrated on 70 and 40  m filter (Falcon). Immunostaining was performed using biotin-conjugated anti-CD34 (clone RAM34; BD Biosciences) PE-conjugated anti-  6-integrin (clone GoH3; BD biosciences). Primary antibodies were washed with 2% FCS/PBS and cells were incubated for 30 min in APC conjugated streptavidin (BD Biosciences) secondary antibodies, on ice, with shaking every 10 min. Living K14- and involucrin-expressing epidermal cells were gated by forward scatter, side scatter, negative staining for Hoechst dye and by following the YFP signal. Basal cells from the interfollicular epidermis were targeted using CD34 negative alpha 6 high gating. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed using FACSAria I at high pressure (70 psi) and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were harvested directly in the lysis buffer provided by the RNeasy microkit (QIAGEN) supplemented with 1  l of beta-mercaptoethanol for every 100  l of lysis buffer.

To elucidate the role of MED1 in keratinocytes, we established keratinocyte-specific MED1-null (MED1epi-/-) mice using the K5Cre-LoxP system. To elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying abnormalities of keratinocytes derived from MED1epi-/- mice, we compared the gene expression patterns of MED1epi-/--derived keratinocytes with their wild type counterparts by microarray analysis. Generation of the MED1 conditional null mutation in epidermal keratinocytes and cell culture:MED1flox/flox mice (Jia et al, J Biol Chem 279:24427. 2004) were mated with K5Cre mice (Tarutani et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 94:7400. 1997) to generate F1 K5Cre+;MED1flox/+ mice. The K5Cre+;MED1flox/+ mice were then mated with MED1flox/flox mice to generate K5Cre+;MED1flox/flox mice (MED1epi-/-). Mice were screened for presence of the transgene by PCR using specific primers for the floxed MED1 gene and the human K5 gene according to the previous reports. Skin of newborn mice was excised after the mice were sacrificed with excessive anesthetic and were treated with dispase followed by trypsin to separate the epidermis from the dermis. Keratinocytes were seeded on type I collagen coated dishes, and were cultured in CnT07 conditioned culture medium (CELLnTEC, Bern, Switzerland). Keratinocytes were used for the experiment as a primary culture. All animal studies were conducted according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Osaka University.Microarray analysis:For comprehensive comparison of gene expression patterns between keratinocytes derived from MED1epi-/- and from WT mice, microarray analysis was used. Total RNAs were extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, San Diego, CA). Then, 2  g total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with T7 oligo d(T) primer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The cDNA synthesis products were used for in vitro transcription reactions containing T7 RNA polymerase and biotinylated nucleotide analogue (pheudouridine base) cRNAs.

If you have questions about the data, contact the submitting laboratory directly (Ross Hardison mailto:rch8@psu.edu). If you have questions about the Genome Browser track associated with this data, contact ENCODE (mailto:genome@soe.ucsc.edu). Knowledge of the function of genomic DNA sequences comes from three basic approaches. Genetics uses changes in behavior or structure of a cell or organism in response to changes in DNA sequence to infer function of the altered sequence. Biochemical approaches monitor states of histone modification, binding of specific transcription factors, accessibility to DNases and other epigenetic features along genomic DNA. In general, these are associated with gene activity, but the precise relationships remain to be established. The third approach is evolutionary, using comparisons among homologous DNA sequences to find segments that are evolving more slowly or more rapidly than expected given the local rate of neutral change. These are inferred to be under negative or positive selection, respectively, and interpreted as DNA sequences needed for a preserved (negative selection) or adaptive (positive selection) function. The ENCODE project aims to discover all the DNA sequences associated with various epigenetic features, with the reasonable expectation that these will also be functional (best tested by genetic methods). However, it is not clear how to relate these results with those from evolutionary analyses. The mouse ENCODE project aims to make this connection explicitly and with a moderate breadth. Assays identical to those being used in the ENCODE project are performed in cell types in mouse that are similar or homologous to those studied in the human project. Thus we will be able to discover which epigenetic features are conserved between mouse and human, and we can examine the extent to which these overlap with the DNA sequences under negative selection. The contribution of DNA with a function preserved in mammals versus that with a function in only one species will be discovered. One of the epigenetic features most closely related to genomic activity is the production of stable RNA, including transcripts from both protein-coding genes and noncoding transcripts. These genomic compilations of transcripts, or transcriptomes, are primary determinants of the way cells function, respond and differentiate, both by the production of proteins translated from coding transcripts and the regulatory activity of untranslated non-coding transcripts. Non-coding RNA's regulate gene expression through diverse mechanisms ranging from reducing chromatin accessibility (affecting large regions or whole chromosomes) to precise fine-tuning of transcription from specific genes, e.g. via RNAi. Even though a large proportion of mammalian genomes is transcribed, many of the transcribed segments have yet to be assigned any function. The ENCODE project aims to create a comprehensive, quantitative annotation of the human transcriptome in several cell and tissue types as well as to understand regulation of transcriptomes by establishing the relationship between regulatory factors and their targets. Mapping the mouse transcriptome in similar tissues will allow us to discern conservation of transcriptome profiles between mouse and human and to discover species-specific transcription patterns, and to infer conserved versus species-specific regulatory mechanisms. The results will have a significant impact on our understanding of the evolution of gene regulation.

This was followed by mRNA selection, fragmentation and cDNA synthesis, which were performed as described previously (Mortazavi et al., 2009). Double-stranded cDNA samples were processed for library construction for Illumina sequencing, using the Illumina ChIP-seq Sample Preparation Kit.Strand-specific libraries were generated in a similar manner, except for a couple of modifications described previously (Parkhomchuk et al., 2009). Briefly, instead of dTTP, dUTP was used during second-strand cDNA synthesis to label the second-strand cDNA. During library preparation, the dUTP-labeled cDNA was treated with Uracil N Glycosylase, prior to the PCR amplification step. This was done to remove uracil from the second-strand, following which the DNA was subjected to high heat to facilitate abasic scission of the second strand.Cluster generation, linearization, blocking and sequencing primer reagents were provided in the Illumina Cluster Amplification kits. All samples are considered as biological replicates.Sequencing was done on the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx and on the Illumina HiSeq 2000. FastQ files for the resulting sequence reads (single read and paired-end, directional and non-directional) were moved to a data library in Galaxy, and tools implemented in Galaxy were used for further processing via workflows ((Giardine et al., 2005), (Blankenberg et al., 2010 ), (Goecks et al., 2010). Data processing was also performed on the CyberSTAR high-performance computing system at Penn State. The reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm9 assembly) using the program TopHat ((Langmead et al., 2009) and (Trapnell et al., 2009)).

Mammalian cells encode many poly(A)-specific exoribonucleases but their individual roles are poorly understood.  Here, we undertook an analysis of the role of PARN deadenylase in mouse myoblasts using global measurements of mRNA decay rates.  Our results reveal that a discrete set of mRNAs exhibit altered mRNA decay as a result of PARN depletion and that stabilization is associated with increased poly(A) tail length and translation.  We determined that stabilization of mRNAs does not generally result in their increased abundance supporting the idea that mRNA decay is coupled to transcription.   Importantly, PARN knockdown has wide ranging effects on gene expression that specifically impact the extracellular matrix and cell migration.  Finally, although PARN has its own unique target transcripts it also influences some genes whose expression is modulated by other deadenylases. In order to investigate the role of PARN deadenyl on mRNA decay in mouse muscle cells , C2C12 cells were transfected by shRNA knockdown of PARN and treated with actinomycin D to inhibit transcription.

Whereas some Lamarckian ideas about environmental inheritance have been dismissed, increasing evidence suggest that certain acquired traits can be transmitted to the next generation. It is therefore of great interest to determine how and to what extent a maternal lifestyle change contributes to their offspring. Here we show that enriched environment (EE) induced maternal slimming improves general health and reprograms metabolic gene expression in mice offspring. EE in mothers induced decreased body weight, adiposity, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Relative to controls, their offspring exhibited improved general health such as reduced fat accumulation, enhanced metabolic parameters as well as glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Maternal slimming altered the expression of 1,732 genes in the liver of offspring, with coherent downregulation of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Epigenomic profiling in offspring revealed numerous changes in cytosine methylation depending on maternal slimming, including hypermethylation of several genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, correlated with the downregulation of these genes. Maternal slimming also altered overall transcriptome patterns in mature oocytes, which contributes largely to the metabolic health and gene expression patterns in offspring. Overall, our studies suggest that maternal slimming have a beneficial role in regulating metabolic profiles in offspring, implying that it might be considered as a potential strategy to reverse the global prevalence of obesity and related metabolic syndromes. Female F0 founders were raised on a standard diet in a normal cage until 12 weeks of age, at which point they were placed into the enriched environmental cage or stayed in the normal cage (chosen at random) for 4 weeks. Males were always raised on a standard diet in the standard cage. At 16 weeks, female F0 founders were mated with males in standard conditions. After 1 or 2 days, males were removed, and pregnant females were left alone with a standard diet in the standard cage until their litters were 3 weeks of age. Note that we always used virgin males to avoid confounding effects brought about by the males. Moreover, males mated with two female groups did not differ in phenotypic data (body weight, adiposity, fasting blood glucose and insulin levels). At 3 weeks of age, partial offspring were sacrificed and the median lobe of liver was rapidly dissected out and flash-frozen in liquid N2, each from an independent mother.

Additionally, in embryonic stem cells (ESC) undergoing the early stages of differentiation, Msi2 has been shown to associate with Sox2, which is required for the self-renewal of ESC. These findings led us to examine the effects of Msi2 on the behavior of ESC. Using an shRNA sequence that targets Msi2 and a scrambled shRNA sequence, we determined that knockdown of Msi2 disrupts the self-renewal of ESC and promotes their differentiation. Collectively, our findings argue that Msi2 is required to support the self-renewal and pluripotency of ESC. We used microarrays to better understand global changes in ESC gene expression following the knockdown of the RNA-binding protein Msi2 as compared to control ESC expressing a scrambled shRNA. Mouse embryonic stem cells (D3) were treated with lentivirus engineered for the expression of a Msi2 targeting shRNA sequence or scrambled (control) shRNA sequence. Following selection for infected cells with puromycin, cells were subcultured at low density and allowed to grow for 4 days (see treatment protocol) before RNA was extracted.

The protocol for infection of D3 ESC with lentiviruses has been described previously (Cox,J.L., 2011, PMID: 21750191). D3 ESC were infected with lentiviruses for 24 hours followed by selection with puromycin for 24 hours.

Here we show that simulated body temperature cycles, but not peripheral oscillators, can control the rhythmic expression of Cold-Inducible RNA binding Protein (CIRP) in cultured fibroblasts. In turn, loss-of-function experiments indicate that CIRP is required for high amplitude circadian gene expression. The transcriptome-wide identification of CIRP-bound RNAs by a biotin-streptavidin based CLIP-seq procedure revealed several CIRP-bound transcripts encoding circadian oscillator proteins. One of these, CLOCK, accumulated to particularly low levels in CIRP-depleted fibroblasts. Since ectopic expression of CLOCK improved circadian gene expression in these cells, we surmise that CIRP confers robustness to circadian oscillators via the regulation of CLOCK expression.

Here, we describe a modular system for the generation of artificial hematopoietic niches in the mouse embryo. A circumscribed tissue that lacks niche function but is physiologically accessible for hematopoietic progenitor cells is functionalized by individual and combinatorial expression of four factors, the chemokines Ccl25 and Cxcl12, the cytokine Scf and the Notch ligand DLL4.

The surprisingly simple rules determining niche outcomes enable the in vivo engineering of artificial niches conducive to the presence of distinct myeloid or T or B lymphoid lineage precursors.

These phenotypic changes are associated with increased expression of E2F members and E2F-dependent transcriptional activity. Here, we have focused on the possible dependence on E2F1 gene function. We have generated mice that lack Rb1 in epidermis in an inducible manner (RbF/F;K14creERTM). These mice are indistinguishable from those lacking pRb in this tissue in a constitutive manner (RbF/F;K14cre). In an E2F1-null background (RbF/F;K14creERTM; E2F1-/- mice), the phenotype due to acute Rb1 loss is not ameliorated by E2F1 loss, but rather exacerbated, indicating that pRb functions in epidermis do not rely solely on E2F1. On the other hand, RbF/F;K14creERTM;E2F1-/- mice develope spontaneous epidermal tumours of hair follicle origin with high incidence. These tumours, which retain a functional p19arf/p53 axis, also show aberrant activation of   catenin/Wnt pathway. Gene expression studies revealed that these tumours display relevant similarities with specific human tumours. These data demonstrate that the Rb/E2F1 axis exerts essential functions not only in maintaining epidermal homeostasis, but also in suppressing tumour development in epidermis, and that the disruption of this pathway may induce tumour progression through specific alteration of developmental programs. Gene expression was compared between normal mouse skin, skin from transgenic RbF/F;K14creERTM; E2F1-/- , E2F1-/-, and RbF/F;K14creERTM; E2F1-/- mouse, and carcinomas arising in the skin of RbF/F;K14creERTM; E2F1-/- mouse.

We originally targeted PML-RARA expression with CTSG regulatory elements, based on the early observation that this gene was maximally expressed in cells with promyelocyte morphology. Here, we show that both Ctsg and PML-RARA targeted to the Ctsg locus (in Ctsg-PML-RARA mice) are detected in the purified KLS cells of these mice (Kit+Lin-Sca+ cells, which are highly enriched for HSPCs), and this expression results in biological effects in multi-lineage competitive repopulation assays. Although PML-RARA is indeed expressed at high levels in the promyelocytes of Ctsg-PML-RARA mice, it does not significantly alter the transcriptional signature of these cells, or induce their self-renewal. In sum, these results suggest that in murine models, PML-RARA acts primarily to affect the function of multi-potent progenitor cells, rather than promyelocytes. Since PML/Pml is normally expressed in the HSPCs of both humans and mice, and since some human APL samples contain TCR rearrangements and express T lineage genes, we suggest that the very early hematopoietic expression of PML-RARA in our mouse model may closely mimic the physiologic expression pattern of PML-RARA in human APL patients. Bone marrow from individual mice expressing PML-RARA from the murine Ctg locus (mCG-PR) and littermate controls was harvested from both femurs and tibia.

Several studies have documented that human placental development is profoundly influenced by oxygen tension. Further the developing murine embryo also experiences hypoxic conditions prior to parturition, which regulates early organogenesis and embryonic blood vessel formation in vivo.  Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from 129/SvJ mice were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs) and were subjected to two oxygen treatments: normoxia (21% O2) and hypoxia (2.6%). Hypoxia was achieved in a humidified chamber flushed with 95% N2/5% CO2 until the oxygen level was stably maintained at 2.6%. EBs were transferred on days E8, E12, E15 and E18 to hypoxia or maintained in normoxia. After 2 days of differential oxygen treatments, these EBs were analyzed at E10, E14, E17 and E20 respectively.

The ES cells were maintained in an undifferentiated state by supplementing the ES media with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). After three passages, ES cell differentiation was achieved by the removal of fibroblasts and LIF. At E3.5, EBs were maintained in normoxia (21% O2) in 100 mm bacterial culture plates (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) and cultured with Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco, Eggenstein, Germany) containing 4,500 mg/L D-glucose, L-glutamine, Pyrodoxine Hydrochloride and 25 mM HEPES buffer.

To further explore the pulmonary innate immune response to ozone exposure, we investigated the effect of ozone in combination with Pam3CYS, a synthetic TLR2/TLR1 agonist.    Methods:  Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)  and lungs were harvested from C57Bl/6 mice after exposure to ozone or filtered air followed by saline or Pam3CYS 24 hours later.  Cells and cytokines in the BAL, surface expression of TLRs on macrophages, and lung RNA genomic expression profiles were examined.  Results:  We demonstrate an increased BAL cell influx, increased IL-6 and KC, and decreased MIP-1   and TNF-   in response to Pam3CYS as a result of ozone pre-exposure. We also observed increased cell surface expression of TLR4, TLR2 and TLR1 on macrophages as a result of ozone alone or in combination with Pam3CYS. Gene expression analysis of lung tissue revealed a significant increase in expression of genes related to injury repair and cell cycle as a result of ozone exposure.  When comparing Pam3CYS treated animals to saline treated animals with or without ozone, genes associated with inflammation were significantly increased.  Potentially novel ozone exposure candidate genes (CCK, RELM-   and   ) were identified.     Conclusion: Our results extend previous findings with ozone/LPS to other TLRs PAMPs and suggest that ozone priming of innate immunity is a general mechanism. Gene expression profiling of lung tissue identified transcriptional networks and genes that contribute to the priming of innate immunity at the molecular level. Mice were exposed to either 2ppm ozone or filtered air (FA) for 3 hours.  24 hours following ozone exposure, mice from either the ozone or FA group were treated intratracheally with either 100ug of Pam3CYS in saline or saline alone.

We overcome this limitation by using a very large number of varied microarray datasets as a common reference, so that statistical attributes of each probeset, such as dynamic range or a threshold between low and high expression can be reliably discovered through meta-analysis. This strategy is implemented in web-based platform named    Gene Expression Commons    (http://gexc.stanford.edu/ ) with datasets of 39 distinct highly purified mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor/functional cell populations covering almost the entire hematopoietic system. Since the Gene Expression Commons is designed as an open platform, any scientist can explore gene expression of any gene, search by expression pattern of interest, submit their own microarray datasets, and design their own working models. Gene expression profiling of entire mouse hematopoiesis system (39 populations) by Gene Expression Commons system.The Samples (101) below comprise new and re-processed data and represent 37 populations.The complete dataset comprising new, re-processed, and third-party reanalyzed data (107 samples), and representing all 39 populations, is linked below as a supplementary file. .. 2 months;  2-3 months;  3 months;  male;  BLP;  CD4+ CD69+;  CD4+ CD69-;  CD8+ CD69+;  CD8+ CD69-;  CLP;  DN1;  DN2;  DN3a;  DN3b;  DN4;  DP CD69+;  DP CD69-;  FoB;  FrB;  FrC;  FrD;  FrE;  GMLPa;  GMLPb;  GMP;  Gra;  HSC;  MEP;  MPPa;  MPPb;  Mono;  MzB;  T1B;  T2B;  iNK;  mNK;  pGMPa;  pGMPb;  pMEP;  preproB;  sCMP;  total RNA;  Bone marrow;  Spleen;  Thymocyte;  Thymus;  bone marrow;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Functional studies support its relevance for tissue homeostasis, but the global dynamics of DNA methylation during in vivo differentiation have not been worked out in detail. Here we report high-resolution DNA methylation maps of adult stem cell differentiation in mouse, focusing on 19 purified cell populations of the blood and skin lineages. Except for global demethylation in erythrocytes, observed DNA methylation changes were locus-specific and relatively modest in size. They frequently overlapped with lineage-associated transcription factors and their binding sites, suggesting that DNA methylation may protect cells from aberrant transcription factor activation. DNA methylation and gene expression provided highly complementary information, and combining the two enabled us to infer the blood lineage hierarchy directly from genomic data. In summary, our dataset and analysis demonstrate that in vivo differentiation of adult stem cells is associated with small but informative changes in the distribution of DNA methylation across the mouse genome. We used microarray data to compare the gene expression profiles between various purified cell populations of the blood and skin lineages. Microarray data were obtained for 13 blood cell types (HSC, MPP1, MPP2, CLP, CMP, MEP, GMP, CD4, CD8, B-cell, Eryth, Granu, Mono) and 6 skin cell types (TBSC, ABSC, MTAC, CLDC, EPro, EDif). A subset of these microarray profiles have already been uploaded to GEO as part of previous research and were reused for the current study (GSE20244: MPP1, MPP2, CLP, CMP, GMP; GSE6506: CD4, CD8, B-cell, Eryth, Granu, Mono; GSE31028: TBSC, ABSC, MTAC).

The antibiotic mixture consisted of colistin 850 U/mL (which corresponds to 4.2 mg/kg), gentamicin 0.035 mg/mL (which corresponds to 3.5 mg/kg), metronidazole 0.215 mg/mL (which corresponds to 21.5 mg/kg) and vancomycin 0.045 mg/mL (which corresponds to 4.5 mg/kg). The mixture was prepared and added to the drinking water for a 3-day pre-treatment period. A control group that received no antibiotics was also included. Following the treatment all mice were given regular autoclaved water for 2 days and all mice including the control group received a single dose of clindamycin (32 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 1 day before C. difficile challenge.;

However, the genetic regulation of such adaptation is obscure. Here, combined analysis of germ free and conventionalized mice revealed that the major molecular adaptations were initiated at day 4 of conventionalization with a strong induction of innate immune functions followed by stimulation of adaptive immune functions. We identified central regulatory genes and reconstructed a common regulatory network that appeared to be sufficient to regulate the dynamic adaptation of the intestinal mucosa to the colonizing microbiota. The majority of the genes within this regulatory network play roles in mucosal inflammatory diseases in mouse and human. We propose that the identified central regulatory network may serve as a genetic signature for control of intestinal homeostasis in healthy mice and may help to unravel the genetic basis of pathway dysregulation in human intestinal inflammatory diseases.

Here we have used in vivo gene targeting to insert an enhancer-promoter element at an imprinted chromosome 12 locus in mice, thereby converting ~1 in 20,000 normal hepatocytes into a focus of HCC with a single genetic modification.   A 300 kb chromosomal domain containing multiple mRNAs, snoRNAs and microRNAs was activated surrounding the integration site.   An identical domain was activated at the syntenic locus in a specific molecular subclass of spontaneous human HCCs with a similar histological phenotype, which was associated with partial loss of DNA methylation.   These findings demonstrate the accuracy of in vivo gene targeting in modeling human cancer, and suggest future applications in studying various tumors in diverse animal species.

We examined pro-inflammatory gene activation in activated wildtype and IFNAR-/- murine macrophages by performing RNA-Seq with poly(A) enriched transcripts. This experimental strategy allowed a global, high-resolution analysis of the transcriptional regulation of diverse classes of co-expressed genes and allowed us to identify co-expressed gene classes that may depend on IFN-signaling for its expression. The results provide quantitative insights into the relationship between transcription and distinct promoter and chromatin properties.

ETS1/2 and Mesp homologues of cardiogenic transcription factors of Ciona intestinalis, to convert primary human dermal fibroblasts into cardiac progenitors. Here we show murine Ets2 has an obligatory role for directing cardiac progenitors during cardiopoesis in embryonic stem cells. ETS2 converted fibroblasts into KDR/Flk1+ replicative cells but, like the purported cardiac master regulatory gene Mesp1, could not by itself generate cardiac progenitors de novo from fibroblasts. Co-expression of both Ets2 and Mesp1, however, successfully reprogrammed differentiated fibroblasts into cardiac progenitors, as shown by the de novo appearance of core cardiac transcription factors, gap junction proteins, sarcomeric proteins, electrical activity and contractility. ETS2 and Mesp1 sit at the pinnacle of the cardiopoesis regulatory hierarchy and are well suited for treating human heart disease. Co-expression of both Ets2 and Mesp1, reprogrammed differentiated fibroblasts into cardiac progenitors All sample were done in triplicates, controls were NHDF and ETS2 only infected cells.

In both cases, the SPPARgMs generated attenuated gene regulatory responses, and their gene expression signatures were more enriched in metabolic pathways that are likely to mediate anti-diabetic efficacy than those of PPARg full agonists. More importantly, our profiling results demonstrated that in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and db/db mice, SPPARgMs regulate the expression of anti-diabetic efficacy-associated genes to a greater extent than that of adverse effect-associated genes, while PPARg full agonists regulate both gene sets proportionally.

We and others have demonstrated that Ha-ras overexpression induces autophagy in NIH3T3 cells. Autophagic machinery is regulated by a family of autophagy associated genes (Atg). The inducible Ha-ras oncogene was introduced into mouse embryo fibroblast Atg5 wild type [MEF-Atg5(+/+)] and Atg5 knock-out [MEF-Atg5(-/-)] cells and the stable cell lines MR and M5R were established, respectively. Our results showed that M5R cell induced larger tumor formation compared with MR cells while these two cell lines were subcutaneously injected into SCID mice under Ha-ras overexpression conditions. It indicates that Atg5 is involved in the suppression of Ras-related tumor formation. MicroRNA (miRNA), approximately 22 nucleotide of non-coding RNA, regulates transcription and translation of the target genes and is involved in cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. A miRNA microarray (932 probes) screening was conducted to identify the autophagy-tumorigenesis-related miRNAs.  Among the significant genes, miR-224 was highly expressed in autophagy deficient cell and it induced tumors. Overexpression miR-224 enhanced the activity of migration and invasion in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. In conclusion, this is the first report to demonstrate that autophagy suppresses tumor formation through down-regulation of microRNA in this case miR-224. MR and M5R cell lines were treated with IPTG for 48 hr. In addition, these cell lines were subcutaneously injected into mice to induce tumor formation. The RNA samples were extracted from above cell lines and tumors. In this research, BEL/ITRI 15K V1.0 miRNA microarray chips were used to evaluate the miRNA expression profile. ..

There are several chemically induced and genetically modified mouse models used to study lung cancer. We hypothesized that spontaneous murine (B6C3F1) lung tumors can serve as a model to study human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).    Methods: RNA was extracted from untreated 2-year-old B6C3F1 mouse spontaneous lung (SL) tumors and age-matched normal lung tissue from a chronic inhalation NTP study. Global gene expression analysis was performed using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip   arrays. After data normalization, for each probe set, pairwise comparisons between groups were made using a bootstrap t-test while controlling the mixed directional false discovery rate (mdFDR) to generate a differential gene expression list. IPA, KEGG, and EASE software tools were used to evaluate the overrepresented cancer genes and pathways.     Results: MAPK and TGF-beta pathways were overrepresented within the dataset. Almost all of the validated genes by quantitative real time RT-PCR had comparable directional fold changes with the microarray data. The candidate oncogenes included Kras, Braf, Raf1, Id2, Hmga1, Cks1b, and Foxf1. The candidate tumor suppressor genes included Rb1, Cdkn2a, Hnf4a, Tcf21, Ptprd, Hpgd, Hopx, Ogn, Id4, Hoxa5, Smad6, Smad7, Zbtb16, Cyr61, Dusp4, and Ifi16. In addition, several genes important in lung development were also differentially expressed, such as Smad6, Hopx, Sox4, Sox9 and Mycn.     Conclusion: In this study, we have demonstrated that several cancer genes and signaling pathways relevant for human NSCLC were similarly altered in spontaneous murine lung tumors.

Here, we used genome-wide approaches to identify Pax5 target genes in pro-B and mature B cells. In these cell types, Pax5 bound to 40% of the cis- regulatory elements defined by mapping Dnase I hypersensitive (DHS) sites, transcription start sites and histone modifications. Although Pax5 bound to 8,000 target genes, it regulated only 4% of them in pro-B and mature B cells by inducing enhancers at activated genes and eliminating DHS sites at repressed genes. Pax5-regulated genes in pro-B cells account for 23% of all expression changes occurring between common lymphoid progenitors and committed pro-B cells, which identifies Pax5 as an important regulator of this developmental transition. Regulated Pax5 target genes minimally overlap in pro-B and mature B cells, which reflects massive expression changes between these cell types. Hence, Pax5 controls B cell identity and function by regulating distinct target genes in early and late B lymphopoiesis. 44 samples (16 RNA-seq, 15 ChIP-seq,  6 DHS-seq, 5 Bio-ChIP-seq, 2 CAGE-seq).

Here, we provide evidence that loss of mesenchymal Notch/CSL signaling causes tissue alterations, including stromal atrophy and inflammation, which precede and are potent triggers for epithelial tumors. Mice carrying a mesenchymal-specific deletion of CSL/RBP-JK, a key Notch effector, exhibit spontaneous multifocal keratinocyte tumors that develop after dermal atrophy and inflammation. CSL-deficient dermal fibroblasts promote increased tumor cell proliferation through up-regulation of c-Jun and c-Fos expression and consequently higher levels of diffusible growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and matrix remodeling enzymes. In human skin samples, stromal fields adjacent to cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and multifocal premalignant actinic keratosis lesions exhibit decreased Notch/CSL signaling and associated molecular changes. Importantly, these changes in gene expression are also induced by UVA, a known environmental cause of cutaneous field cancerization and skin cancer.

Recently, they have acquired greater relevance as active components of the adult neural stem cell (aNSC) niches. Astrocytes located in the vicinity of aNSC reservoirs are thought to regulate aNSC behaviour. We have compared the function of glial cells isolated from the postnatal and adult subventricular zone and hippocampus (two stem cell niches, where aNSCs self-renew and give rise to immature neurons), from the olfactory bulb (a neurogenic region where the immature neurons cease to proliferate and terminally differentiate) and from a non-stem and non-neurogenic area such as the ventral mesencephalon. Co-culture experiments demonstrate that subventricular zone glial cells secrete soluble signals that promote NSC self-renewing divisions. We used microarrays to detail the global gene expression of astroglial cells isolated from four different brain regions (olfactory bulb, ventral mesencephalon, hippocampus and subventricular zone) and identified up-regulated genes coding for secreted proteins in astrocytes from the subventricular zone. Primary astrocytes were cultured from four CD-1 mouse brain regions and cells were employed for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

Female A/J mice at 5 weeks of age were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Animals were stabilized on an unsupplemented AIN-76 diet for one week prior to being given the selenium supplemented diet. The basal level of selenium in the diet is 0.35 ppm Se, the selenocytine supplemention was at 15 ppm. NNK was administered i.p. as a single 10 uM injection in 0.2 mL saline. With this protocol, 100% of animals reproducibly develop lung tumors after 3 months. Three days after NNK administration, animals were provided AIN-76A diets supplemented with selenocystine at 15 ppm selenium ad libitum for 10 days. Animals were sacrificed thirteen days after NNK administration. Lung tissue was harvested, immediately homogenized in Trizol and frozen.

Identification of the cell types in this microchimeric population would permit better understanding of possible mechanisms by which they affect maternal health. However, comprehensive analysis of fetal cells has been hampered by their rarity. In this study, we sought to overcome this obstacle by combining flow cytometry with multidimensional gene expression microarray analysis of fetal cells isolated from the murine maternal lung during late pregnancy. Fetal cells were collected from the lungs of pregnant female mice. cDNA was amplified and hybridized to gene expression microarrays. The resulting fetal cell core transcriptome was interrogated using multiple methods including Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, the BioGPS gene expression database, principal component analysis, the Eurexpress gene expression atlas and primary literature.  Here we report that small numbers of fetal cells can be flow sorted from the maternal lung, facilitating discovery-driven gene expression analysis.  We additionally show that gene expression data can provide functional information about the fetal cells. Our results suggest that fetal cells in the murine maternal lung are a mixed population, consisting of trophoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells and cells of the immune system. The detection of trophoblasts and immune cells in the maternal lung may facilitate future mechanistic studies related to the development of immune tolerance and pregnancy-related complications, such as preeclampsia. Furthermore, the presence and persistence of mesenchymal stem cells in maternal organs may have implications for long-term postpartum maternal health.

To assess mechanisms by which EphA4 may modify the response to neural injury, a microarray was performed on spinal cord tissue from mice with spinal cord injury and sham injured controls. RNA was purified from spinal cords of adult EphA4 knockout and wild-type mice four days following lumbar spinal cord hemisection or laminectomy only and was hybridised to Affymetrix All-Exon Array 1.0 GeneChips.  While subsequent analyses indicated that several pathways were altered in EphA4 knockout mice, of particular interest was the attenuated or otherwise altered expression of a number of inflammatory genes, including Arginase 1, expression of which was lower in injured EphA4 knockout compared to wild-type mice. Immunohistological analyses of different cellular components of the immune response were then performed in injured EphA4 knockout and wild-type spinal cords. While numbers of infiltrating CD3+ T cells were low in the hemisection model, a robust CD11b+ macrophage / microglial response was observed post-injury. There was no difference in the overall number or spread of macrophages / activated microglia in injured EphA4 knockout compared to wild-type spinal cords at two, four or fourteen days post-injury, however a lower proportion of Arginase-1 immunoreactive macrophages / activated microglia was observed in EphA4 knockout spinal cords at four days post-injury. Subtle alterations in the neuroinflammatory response in injured EphA4 knockout spinal cords may contribute to the regeneration and recovery observed in these mice following injury.

The spinal cord was cut twice in the same place to ensure complete section.  Control mice underwent a laminectomy only.  After surgery the wound was closed with small metal clips applied using a skin applicator. At 4 days post-injury, mice were culled via CO2 asphyxiation.  Six millimetres of tissue centred on the injury epicenter or equivalent area in control mice was taken from the left uninjured half of the spinal cord.

Alpha-hemolysin (Hla), a pore-forming cytotoxin of S. aureus, has been identified through animal models of pneumonia as a critical virulence factor that induces lung injury. In spite of considerable molecular knowledge of how this cytotoxin injures the host, the precise host response to Hla in the context of infection remains poorly understood. We employed whole-genome expression profiling of infected lung to define the host response to wild-type S. aureus compared with an Hla-deficient isogenic mutant in experimental pneumonia. These data provide a complete expression profile at four and at twenty-four hours post-infection, revealing a unique response to the toxin-expressing strain. Gene ontogeny analysis revealed significant differences in the extracellular matrix and cardiomyopathy pathways, both of which govern cellular interactions in the tissue microenvironment. Evaluation of individual transcript responses to Hla-secreting bacteria was notable for upregulation of host cytokine and chemokine genes, including the p19 subunit of interleukin-23. Consistent with this observation, the cellular immune response to infection was characterized by a prominent TH17 response to wild-type staphylococci. These findings define specific host mRNA responses to Hla-producing S. aureus, coupling the pulmonary TH17 response to the presence of this cytotoxin. Expression profiling to define the host response to a single virulence factor proved to be a valuable tool in identifying pathways for further investigation in S. aureus pneumonia. This approach may be broadly applicable to the study of bacterial toxins, defining host pathways that can be targeted to mitigate toxin-induced disease.

We show Znf217 overexpression drives aberrant differentiation and signaling events, promotes increased self-renewal capacity, mesenchymal marker expression, motility and metastasis, and represses an adult tissue stem cell gene signature downregulated in cancers. By in silico screening, we identified candidate therapeutics that at low concentrations inhibit growth of cancer cells expressing high ZNF217. We demonstrate that the nucleoside analog triciribine inhibits ZNF217-induced tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance, and inhibits signaling events (e.g., P-AKT, P-MAPK) in vivo. Our data suggest ZNF217 is a biomarker of poor prognosis and a therapeutic target in breast cancer patients, and triciribine may be part of a personalized treatment strategy in patients overexpressing ZNF217.

Previous studies on a well-established mouse DES model demonstrated that it recapitulates many features of the human syndrome, yet the underlying molecular mechanism is far from clear. Using the neonatal DES mouse model, the present study uses global transcript profiling to systematically explore early gene expression changes in individual epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of the neonatal uterus.  Over 900 genes show differential expression upon DES treatment in either one or both tissue layers. Interestingly, multiple components of the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR gamma)-mediated adipogenic/lipid metabolic pathway, including PPARgamma itself, are targets of DES in the neonatal uterus. TEM and Oil Red O staining further demonstrate a dramatic increase in lipid deposition in the uterine epithelial cells upon DES exposure. Neonatal DES exposure also perturbs glucose homeostasis in the uterine epithelium. Some of these neonatal DES-induced metabolic changes appear to last into adulthood, suggesting a permanent effect of DES on energy metabolism in uterine epithelial cells. This study extends the list of biological processes that can be regulated by estrogen or DES, and provides a novel perspective for endocrine disruptor induced reproductive abnormalities. We separated UE from the UM from vehicle (oil)- or DES-treated postnatal day 5 (P5) mice, and prepared biological triplicates of RNA from pooled specimens (n   3). Those samples were analyzed on two MouseWG-6 BeadChips, which detects 45,200 transcripts including more than 26,000 annotated genes in the NCBI RefSeq database.

We evaluated the therapeutic effect of a DNA enzyme targeting c-jun mRNA in mice with pre-existing retinal neovascularization. A single injection of Dz13 in a lipid formulation containing N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine inhibited c-Jun expression and reduced retinal microvascular density. The DNAzyme inhibited retinal microvascular density as effectively as VEGF-A antibodies. Comparative microarray and gene expression analysis determined that Dz13 suppressed not only c-jun but a range of growth factors and matrix-degrading enzymes. Dz13 in this formulation inhibited microvascular endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tubule formation in vitro. Moreover, animals treated with Dz13 sensed the top of the cage in a modified forepaw reach model, unlike mice given a DNAzyme with scrambled RNA-binding arms that did not affect c-Jun expression.

Therefore, we performed comprehensive, whole-genome expression profiling of murine memory CD8 T cells before and shortly after ex vivo stimulation. We compared this differential expression profile to its counterpart from stimulated naive cells. Given that memory cells arise from naive cells, the quiescent state of both cell populations prior to stimulation, and the early time point analyzed (four hours post-stimulation), it was possible that the stimulation-induced changes in gene expression were identical between the two populations. While there was a high degree of overlap, we found that the majority of up-regulated genes were more highly induced following stimulation of memory cells. This more robust increase in transcript levels was observed for a functionally diverse set of genes, including cytokines, chemokines, amino acid metabolic enzymes and transporters, transcription factors and regulators of RNA processing. We also identified the unique, stimulation-induced signatures of naive and memory CD8 T cells and found that the former was enriched for factors involved in regulating chromatin modifications. Specifically, we found that Hdac 5,7 and 8 transcript levels were rapidly down-regulated following stimulation of naive cells, which correlated with an increase in their total level of acetylated histone H3 (AcH3). This was in contrast to stimulated memory cells, which had higher levels of total AcH3 ex vivo that did not change following short-term stimulation. Furthermore, the unique stimulation-induced expression profile of memory cells was enriched for factors involved in regulating transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, including multiple members of the nuclear pore complex. Together, these results support a model whereby the chromatin modifications that occur during the differentiation of na  ve cells into memory cells are preserved in resting memory populations, facilitating their more robust re-activation of a functionally diverse set of genes that contribute to rapid recall of effector functions. Na  ve (CD44lo) and memory phenotype (CD44hi) CD8 T cells from 7-wk old female B6 mice were FACS-purified and cultured in vitro for four hours in the presence or absence of PMA and ionomycin.

Here, we show that the young brain has an endogenous defense mechanisms against HG-astrocytomas. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) migrate to HG-astrocytomas, reduce glioma expansion and prolong survival by releasing a group of fatty-acid ethanolamides that have agonistic activity on the vanilloid receptor (transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member-1; TRPV1). TRPV1 expression is much higher in HG-astrocytomas than in the tumor-free brain and TRPV1 stimulation triggers tumor cell-death via the activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) controlled branch of the ER-stress pathway. The anti-tumourigenic response of NPCs is lost with aging. NPC-mediated tumor suppression can be mimicked in the old brain by systemic administration of the synthetic vanilloid Arvanil, indicating that TRPV1 agonists hold potential as new HG-astrocytoma therapeutics. The goal of this microarray study was understand how neural stem / precursor cell (NPC) induced high grade astrocytoma cell-death is controlled by changes in gene expression. We investigated the gene-expression pattern in mouse high grade astrocytoma GL261 cells after incubation with NPC non-conditioned medium (controls) or NPC-conditioned medium by microarrays and found that endoplasmic reticulum stress genes like the activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) were robustly up-regulated in NPC-conditioned medium treated mouse high grade astrocytoma cells, compared to controls.Comparison of two experimental groups (conditioned medium treated versus non-conditioned medium treated) in three dye swap experiments (6 arrays used in total). .. high grade astrocytoma cells (GL261);  NPC medium;  non-conditioned medium;  total RNA;  GL261 grown in NPC medium;  GL261 grown in unconditioned medium;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Endoplasmic reticulum stress genes are upregulated in mouse high grade astrocytoma cells (GL261) treated with neural stem/precursor cell (NPC) conditioned medium;

The knock-in mice develop severe skin lesions and begin to die after 6 to 10 months. We also found lung SCCs in some of the mice. To study lung SCC development, we stabilize the skin condition by crossing  KA/KA with Lori.Ikk   transgenic mice to generate KA/KA-Lori.Ikk   mice, which 100% spontaneously developed lethal lung SCC at 4 to 6 months of age. Clodronate-liposomes obtained from Dr. N. van Rooijen (Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands) were intravenously injected into mice twice every week, started in 4 weeks old mice, and continued for 3 months. The dose of clodronate-liposomes was 100  l during the first month and elevated to 150 100  l after that. The depletion efficacy was confirmed by detecting pulmonary macrophages with Flow Cytometry. Depletion of macrophages in these KA/KA-Lori.Ikk   mice could significantly reduce inflammation and prevent lung SCC developmrnt.

This questions whether the phenotypic differences in the organ development observed in the individual knockout mice result from isoform-specific functions or quantitative differences in the expression levels of each STAT5 isoform among tissues.  To elucidate the redundancy and isoform-specificity of STAT5 for development at molecular levels, mice carrying only a single allele of either Stat5a or Stat5b were generated.  Both of these mice overcame the lethal anemia observed in Stat5ab-null mice, indicating that development of erythroid cell lineage was totally dependent on the dosage of STAT5.  The blocked progression of B cell lineage at the pre-pro B cell stage in Stat5ab-/- mice was rescued in the presence of a single allele of either Stat5a or Stat5b, while the number of total B220+ cells in bone marrow was smaller in Stat5abnull/Stat5b- mice than Stat5abnull/Stat5a- mice.  The paucity of alveolar progenitor cells in the Stat5ab-null mammary epithelium was rescued by a single allele of either Stat5a but not Stat5b, suggesting cell-type dependent isoform-specific function. Genome-wide gene expression analyses revealed that different steps of cell lineage progression require different gene sets which expression requires the different isoform of STAT5 in a dose-dependent manner in the mammary epithelium.  Taken together, this study demonstrates that dose-dependent isoform specificity of STAT5A and STAT5B controls progression and differentiation of each cell lineage. Six days after observation of a plug, mammary tissues from three of each Stat5a-/- mice, Stat5ab+/null mice, Stat5abnull/Stat5b- and Stat5abnull/Stat5a- mice were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70   C .. mixed background of C57BL/6, FVB, and 129;  Stat5a-/-;  Stat5ab+/null;  Stat5abnull/Stat5a-;  Stat5abnull/Stat5b-;  total RNA;  83;  909;  913;  957;  958;  959;  AAB6;  AAB7;  AAB8;  ABB2;  ABB3;  ABB4;  10090;  Mus musculus;  The Mx1-Cre transgene was activated by intraperitoneal injection of PolyIC (polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid) as described (Kimura et al., 2009).

Oncogenic Kras mutation is the signature event in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), serving a critical role in tumor initiation.  Here, an inducible KrasG12D-driven p53 mutant PDAC mouse model establishes that advanced PDAC remains strictly dependent on continued KrasG12D expression and that KrasG12D serves a vital role in the control of tumor metabolism, through stimulation of glucose uptake and channeling of glucose intermediates through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Notably, these studies reveal that oncogenic Kras regulates ribose biogenesis. Unlike canonical models of PPP-mediated ribose biogenesis, we demonstrate that oncogenic Kras drives intermediates from enhanced glycolytic flux into the non-oxidative arm of the PPP, thereby decoupling ribose biogenesis from NADPNADPH-mediated redox control. Together, this work provides in vivo mechanistic insights into how oncogenic Kras promotes metabolic reprogramming in native tumors and illuminates potential metabolic targets that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in Kras-driven PDAC. Primary pancreatic tumor lines were established from p48Cre tetO_LKrasG12D ROSA_rtTAL+ p53L+ mice. Five independent tumor lines (iKras1-5) were used for pancreatic injection into nude mice to generate orthotopic tumors. The mice were kept on doxycycline for 2 weeks until obvious tumor formation.

We generated Stat5a and Stat5b double knock-in (DKI) N-domain mutant mice that form dimers but not tetramers, identified cytokine-regulated genes whose expression required STAT5 tetramers, and defined consensus motifs for dimers versus tetramers. Whereas Stat5- deficient mice exhibited perinatal lethality, DKI mice were viable, indicating that STAT5 dimers were sufficient for survival. Nevertheless, STAT5 DKI mice had fewer CD4+CD25+ T cells, NK cells, and CD8+ T cells, with impaired cytokine-induced proliferation and homeostatic proliferation of CD8+ T cells. DKI CD8+ T cell proliferation following viral infection was diminished and DKI Treg cells did not efficiently control colitis.

Here, we show induction of a fail-safe mechanism mediated by the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery that results in activation of the ATR/ATM-Chk1/Chk2-p53/p21 checkpoint and cellular senescence at early stages of cellular transformation caused by a regulatable MLL-ENL-ERtm in mice. Furthermore, we identified the transcription program underlying this intrinsic anti-cancer barrier, and DDR-induced inflammatory regulators that fine-tune the signaling towards senescence, thereby modulating the fate of MLL-ENL-immortalized cells in a tissue-environment-dependent manner. Our results indicate that DDR is a rate-limiting event for acquisition of stem cell-like properties in MLL-ENL-ERtm-mediated transformation, as experimental inhibition of the barrier accelerated the transition to immature cell states and acute leukemia development. We created a mouse model wherein the protein function of the MLL-ENL oncogene depends on tamoxifen due to fusion with the mutated estrogen-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ERtm). After 7 months of tamoxifen administration, the MLL-ENL-ERtm mice developed a myeloproliferative disease, which progressed into the terminal stage after a long period (mean survival: 592    112 days) of continuous tamoxifen provision. We have profiled gene expression at three time-points of tamoxifen treatment corresponding to three distinct cellular states of the MLL-ENL-ERtm-induced myeloproliferation in the bone marrow: 1. 7 months - high proliferation state with low DDR signaling (4 biological replicates), 2. 7-8 months - the transition period of lower proliferation and high DDR activity (4 biogical replicates) and 3. 8 months - the senescence (3 biological replicates). Time-matched tamoxifen-treated wild-type bone marrow analysed in 4 biological replicates. We have profiled gene expression in three disease stages in the spleen: 1. 7 months - early stage - induced proliferation and DDR (3 biological replicates), 2. 9-10 months - progression - partial senescence and DDR is maintained (3 biological replicates) and 3. 16-23 months - terminal stage - proliferation, low or absent DDR and no senescence (3 biological replicates).

To define molecular mechanisms controlling this progression, we probed five stages spanning the commitment process using deep sequencing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq methods to track genome-wide shifts in transcription, cohorts of active transcription factor genes, histone modifications at diverse classes of cis-regulatory elements, and binding patterns of GATA-3 and PU.1, transcription factors with complementary roles in T-cell development. The results locate potential promoter-distal cis-elements in play and reveal both activation sites and diverse mechanisms of repression that silence genes used in alternative lineages. Histone marking is dynamic and reversible, and while permissive marks anticipate, repressive marks often lag behind changes in transcription. In vivo binding of PU.1 and GATA-3 relative to epigenetic marking reveals distinctive, factor-specific rules for recruitment of these crucial transcription factors to different subsets of their potential sites, dependent on dose and developmental context. Genome-wide expression profiles, global distributions of three different histone modifications, and global occupancies of two transcription factors were examined in five developmentally related immature T populations. High throughput sequencing generated on average 9-30 million of mappable reads (single-read) for each ChIP-seq sample, and 10-15 million (single-read) for RNA-seq. Independent biological replicates were analyzed for individual populations.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial biological regulators that act by suppressing their target genes and are involved in a variety of pathophysiologic processes. MiR-127 appeared to be down-regulated during lung injury. We set out to investigate the role of miR-127 in lung injury and inflammation. Expression of miR-127 significantly reduced cytokine release by macrophages. Looking into the mechanisms of the regulation of inflammation by miR-127, we found that IgG Fc   Receptor I (Fc  RI/CD64) was a target of miR-127, as evidenced by reduced CD64 protein expression in macrophages over-expressing miR-127. Furthermore, miR-127 significantly reduced the luciferase activity with a reporter construct containing the native 3   -UTR of CD64. Importantly, we demonstrated that miR-127 attenuated lung inflammation in an IgG immune complex (IgG IC) model in vivo. Collectively, these data show that miR-127 targets macrophage CD64 expression and promotes the reduction of lung inflammation. Understanding how miRNAs regulate lung inflammation may represent an attractive way to control inflammation induced by infectious or non-infectious lung injury.

Our assumption is that distinct p53-pathways regulate tumor suppression and aging and that p66Shc is one of the master regulators of the p53 aging function. p66Shc longevity determinant protein acts as a downstream target of p53 and it is indispensable for the ability of activated p53 to induce elevation of intracellular oxidants and apoptosis.

However, the reprogramming needed to generate BMDH and the identity of the resultant cells are essentially unknown. In a mouse model of chronic liver damage, here we identify a modification in the chromatin structure of the hematopoietic nucleus during BMDH formation, accompanied by the sequential loss of the key hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1/Sfpi1 (SFFV proviral integration 1) and gain of the key hepatic transcriptional regulator HNF-1A homeobox A (HNF-1A/Hnf1a). Through genome-wide expression analysis of laser captured BMDH, a differential gene expression pattern was detected and the chromatin changes observed were confirmed at the chromatin regulator gene level. Similarly, Tranforming Growth Factor-  1 (TGF-  1) and neurotransmitter (e.g. Prostaglandin E Receptor 4 [Ptger4]) pathway genes were over-expressed. In summary, in vivo BMDH generation is a sequential process in which the hematopoietic cell nucleus changes its identity and acquires hepatic features. These BMDHs have their own cell identity characterized by an expression pattern different from hematopoietic cells or hepatocytes. The role of these BMDHs in the liver requires further investigation.

Here, we expanded the study through small RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis of the host response to both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza virus infections across four founder mouse strains of the Collaborative Cross, a recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits. We observed differential expression of over 200 small RNAs of diverse classes during infection. A majority of identified microRNAs (miRNAs) showed divergent changes in expression across mouse strains with respect to SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections and responded differently to a highly pathogenic reconstructed 1918 virus compared to a minimally pathogenic seasonal influenza virus isolate. Novel insights into miRNA expression changes, including the association with pathogenic outcomes and large differences between in vivo and in vitro experimental systems, were further elucidated by a survey of selected miRNAs across diverse virus infections. The small RNAs identified also included many non-miRNA small RNAs, such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), in addition to nonannotated small RNAs. An integrative sequencing analysis of both small RNAs and long transcripts from the same samples showed that the results revealing differential expression of miRNAs during infection were largely due to transcriptional regulation and that the predicted miRNA-mRNA network could modulate global host responses to virus infection in a combinatorial fashion. These findings represent the first integrated sequencing analysis of the response of host small RNAs to virus infection and show that small RNAs are an integrated component of complex networks involved in regulating the host response to infection. IMPORTANCE: Most studies examining the host transcriptional response to infection focus only on protein-coding genes. However, mammalian genomes transcribe many short and long non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). With the advent of deepsequencing technologies, systematic transcriptome analysis of the host response, including analysis of ncRNAs of different sizes, is now possible. Using this approach, we recently discovered widespread differential expression of host long (>200 nucleotide[nt]) ncRNAs in response to virus infection. Here, the samples described in the previous report were again used, but we sequenced another fraction of the transcriptome to study very short (about 20 to 30 nt) ncRNAs. We demonstrated that virus infection also altered expression of many short ncRNAs of diverse classes. Putting the results of the two studies together, we show that small RNAs may also play an important role in regulating the host response to virus infection. The small RNA transcriptome deep sequencing analysis was performed on lung samples from our previously published study (Unique signatures of long noncoding RNA expression in response to virus infection and altered innate immune signaling , X Peng, MBio. 2010 Oct 26;1(5). pii: e00206-10.). We infected four of the eight founder mouse strains used in generating the Collaborative Cross, a recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits (41).

However, this concept has not been proven in vivo since appropriate mouse models were lacking. Here, we analyzed hepatocarcinogenesis (i) in a novel mouse model of inducible telomere dysfunction on a telomerase-proficient background, (ii) in telomerase knockout mice with chronic telomere dysfunction (G3 mTerc-/-), and (iii) in wild-type mice with functional telomeres and telomerase. Transient or chronic telomere dysfunction enhanced the rates of chromosomal aberrations during hepatocarcinogenesis, but only telomerase-proficient mice exhibited significantly increased rates of macroscopic tumor formation and cancer cell proliferation in response to telomere dysfunction. In contrast, telomere dysfunction resulted in pronounced accumulation of DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in telomerase-deficient liver tumors. Together, these data provide the first in vivo evidence that transient telomere dysfunction during early and late stages of tumorigenesis can promote chromosomal instability and carcinogenesis in telomerase-proficient mice in the absence of additional genetic checkpoint defects at germline level. RNA from liver tumors derived from from DEN treated TTD+ mice TTD- mice and RNA from normal liver 48h-72h after doxycycline induced transient telomere dysfunction in TTD+ and TTD- liver were isolated and RNA was extracted.

Although different evidence explains the mechanisms linking the expansion of adipose tissue and adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) polarization, in the current study we investigated the concept of lipid-induced toxicity as the pathogenic link that could explain the trigger of this response. We addressed this question using isolated ATMs and adipocytes from genetic and diet-induced murine models of obesity. Through transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis, we created a model integrating transcript and lipid species networks simultaneously occurring in adipocytes and ATMs and their reversibility by thiazolidinedione treatment. We show that polarization of ATMs is associated with lipid accumulation and the consequent formation of foam cell   like cells in adipose tissue. Our study reveals that early stages of adipose tissue expansion are characterized by M2-polarized ATMs and that progressive lipid accumulation within ATMs heralds the M1 polarization, a macrophage phenotype associated with severe obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, rosiglitazone treatment, which promotes redistribution of lipids toward adipocytes and extends the M2 ATM polarization state, prevents the lipid alterations associated with M1 ATM polarization. Our data indicate that the M1 ATM polarization in obesity might be a macrophage-specific manifestation of a more general lipotoxic pathogenic mechanism. This indicates that strategies to optimize fat deposition and repartitioning toward adipocytes might improve insulin sensitivity by preventing ATM lipotoxicity and M1 polarization. 15 samples; 2 genotypes and 2 time points .. isolated ATMs and adipocytes;  OBOB;  WT;  total RNA;  OBOB_16_weeks;  OBOB_5_weeks;  WT_16_weeks;  WT_5_weeks;  10090;  Mus musculus;  16;  5;

We have demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is a major regulator of signal transduction and phenotypic switching in SCs. Herein, genome-wide transcriptional profiling, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed the MMP-9 signaling network and its endogenous inhibitor, TIMP-1, among the top induced genes of the injured sciatic nerve, that co-distributed with MMP-9 in myelinating SCs and the paranodal/nodal areas of myelinated fibers. Homo- and heterodimers of the active and proMMP-9 were purified from injured nerves using gelatin-sepharose. MMP-9 gene deletion increased the number of immature, GFAP+ mSC and post-mitotic cell counts that correlate with shorter myelin internodes in remyelinated fibers lacking MMP-9. MMP-9 is essential to nodal clustering of voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channels. MMP inhibitor therapy diminished the expression of Nav 1.7 and 1.8. These data established the essential role of MMP-9 in guiding SC differentiation toward myelin production and in molecular assembly of the myelin domains. Modification of Nav channels in myelinated fibers may thus provide an important therapeutic approach for a number of facilitates regeneration and attenuated neuropathic pain.

By evaluating the gene expression profile of mouse vasculature, we identified DR6/TNFRSF21 and TROY/TNFRSF19 as regulators of CNS-specific angiogenesis in both zebrafish and mice. Furthermore, these two death receptors interact both genetically and physically and are required for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated JNK activation and subsequent human brain endothelial sprouting in vitro. Increasing beta-catenin levels in brain endothelium upregulate DR6 and TROY, indicating that these death receptors are downstream target genes of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which has been shown to be required for BBB development.

DNA methylation patterns are erased in primordial germ cells and in the interval immediately following fertilization.  Subsequent reprogramming occurs by de novo methylation and demethylation.  Variance of DNA methylation patterns between different cell types is not well understood.  Here, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and tiling array technology, we have comprehensively analysed DNA methylation patterns at proximal promoter regions in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, ES cell-derived early germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm) and four adult tissues (brain, liver, skeletal muscle and sperm).  Most of the methylated regions in the three germ layers and in the three adult somatic tissues are shared in common.  This commonly methylated gene set is enriched in germ cell associated genes that are generally transcriptionally inactive in somatic cells.  We also compared DNA methylation patterns with global mapping of histone H3 lysine 4/27 trimethylation, and found that gain of DNA methylation correlates with loss of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation.  Taken together, our findings indicate that differentiation from ES cells to the three germ layers is accompanied by an increase in the number of commonly methylated DNA regions and that these tissue-specific alterations are present for only a small number of genes.  Our findings indicate that DNA methylation at the proximal promoter regions of commonly methylated genes act as an irreversible mark which fixes somatic lineage by repressing transcription of germ cell specific genes.

We have shown previously that intracellular T. gondii inhibit up-regulation of regulatory and effector functions in murine macrophages (M  ) stimulated with interferon (IFN)-  , which is the cytokine crucial for controlling the parasites    replication. Using genome-wide transcriptome analysis we show herein that infection with T. gondii leads to global unresponsiveness of murine macrophages to IFN-  . More than 61% and 89% of the transcripts, which were induced or repressed by IFN-   in non-infected M  , respectively, were not altered after stimulation of T. gondii-infected cells with IFN-  . These genes are involved in a variety of biological processes, which are mostly but not exclusively related to immune responses. Analyses of the underlying mechanisms revealed that IFN-  -triggered nuclear translocation of STAT1 still occurred in Toxoplasma-infected M  . However, STAT1 bound aberrantly to oligonucleotides containing the IFN-  -responsive gamma-activated site (GAS) consensus sequence. Conversely, IFN-   did not induce formation of active GAS-STAT1 complexes in nuclear extracts from infected M  . Mass spectrometry of protein complexes bound to GAS oligonucleotides showed that T. gondii-infected M   are unable to recruit non-muscle actin to IFN-  -responsive DNA sequences, which appeared to be independent of stimulation with IFN-   and of STAT1 binding. IFN-  -induced recruitment of BRG-1 and acetylation of core histones at the IFN-  -regulated CIITA promoter IV, but not   -actin was diminished by >90% in Toxoplasma-infected M   as compared to non-infected control cells. Remarkably, treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors restored the ability of infected macrophages to express the IFN-   regulated genes H2-A/E and CIITA. Taken together, these results indicate that Toxoplasma-infected M   are unable to respond to IFN-   due to disturbed chromatin remodelling, but can be rescued using histone deacetylase inhibitors.

Much is known about the role of these regulators in gene activation, but relatively little is known about the critical process of enhancer silencing during differentiation.  Here we show that the H3K4/K9 histone demethylase LSD1 plays an essential role in decommissioning enhancers during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs).  LSD1 occupies enhancers of active genes critical for control of ESC state.  However, LSD1 is not essential for maintenance of ESC identity.  Instead, ESCs lacking LSD1 activity fail to fully differentiate and ESC-specific enhancers fail to undergo the histone demethylation events associated with differentiation. At enhancers, LSD1 is a component of the NuRD complex, which contains additional subunits that are necessary for ESC differentiation.  We propose that the LSD1-NuRD complex decommissions enhancers of the pluripotency program upon differentiation, which is essential for complete shutdown of the ESC gene expression program and the transition to new cell states. This represents the expression part of the study. .. ZHBTc4 cells;  total RNA;  Embyonic stem cells;  10090;  Mus musculus;  48hr +dox;  48hr +dox +tcp;

Pharmacological proteasomal inhibitors such as lactacystin can induce apoptosis in cultured mouse cortical neurons through the activation of caspase-3.  Furthermore, proteasomal inhibitors are also reported to mediate deleterious alterations in cell cycle regulation, inflammatory processes and protein aggregation and trigger the cell death pathway. We discovered by microarray analysis that lactacystin treatment modulates the expression of both potentially neuroprotective as well as pro-apoptotic genes in neurons.  However, the genes, upon transcriptional modulation, contribute to proteasomal inhibition-induced apoptosis, remains unidentified.  By employing microarray analysis to decipher the time-dependent changes in transcription of these genes in cultured cortical neurons, we discovered different groups of genes were transcriptionally regulated at different phases of lactacystin-induced cell death. Microarray analysis was carried out using 10 murine genome U74A and U74Av2 Genechips array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The assignment of the arrays (GeneChip) was as follows: Control at 24 h (n=2), 48 h (n=2); exposure to 1   M lactacystin for 24 h (n=3) and 48 h (n=3). ..

Global gene expression profiling was performed on flow-sorted rds and wild-type rod photoreceptors immediately prior and subsequent to times at which OSs are normally elaborated.  Dysregulated genes were identified via microarray hybridization, and selected candidates were validated using quantitative PCR analyses. We identified a single key gene, Egr1, that was dysregulated in a sustained fashion in rds rod photoreceptors and in the retina.  Egr1 upregulation was associated with microglial activation and migration, into the outer retina at times subsequent to the major peak of photoreceptor cell death.  Interestingly, this response was accompanied by neurotrophic factor upregulation.  We hypothesize that activation of Egr1 and neurotrophic factors represents a protective immune mechanism, contributing to the characteristically slow retinal degeneration of the rds mouse model. We had two conditions WT and Rds-KO at 4 different time points: postnatal (P) 6, P9, P14 and P21. .. post natal day 14;  post natal day 21;  post natal day 6;  post natal day 9;  Rds-KO;  wild type;  total RNA;  flow sorted rod photoreceptors;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Flow sorted Rod Photoreceptor;  Retinas were dissociated and processed using FACS to recover rod photoreceptors expressing GFP.;

Isolated Limb Perfusion (ILP) with Melphalan (Mel) is used in the treatment of non-resectable locally advanced melanomas of extremity sparing the limb from amputation in 40-50% of the cases. Adding the Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (Tnfa) improves total complete response to 70-90%. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the changes promoted by Mel and Tnfa are not completely understood. In this study we evaluated the impact of systemic Mel and Tnfa administration on tumor growth, analyzed the morphological changes promoted by each treatment, and searched for early molecular targets of Mel and Tnfa, alone or in combination, in a murine melanoma model. Morphological changes were analyzed by histological analysis, while microarray gene expression followed by quantitative RT-PCR were used to search for early molecular targets.  We found that Mel systemic administration accounted for the impairment of tumor-growth (p<0.001) and improvement of survival. Tnfa co-administration augmented necrosis (p<0.024) and decreased mitotic rates (p=0.001). We identified a set of 118 potential molecular markers that might be correlated with the observed biologic response to treatment with Melphalan and Tnfa and which could represent potential therapeutic targets in melanoma.  We used amplified RNA (aRNA) from 18 tumor samples (Control     5 samples; Mel     4 samples; Tnfa     4 samples; and Mel+Tnfa     5 samples). For replica hybridization with dye swap, aRNA from the tumors and from a pool composed of equal amounts of RNA extracted from the K1735M2, M2R, B16F10, and B16F1 melanoma cells were labeled with Alexa555 or Alexa647. Labeled aRNA samples were hybridized against a glass platform containing 16,128 immobilized sense oligonucleotides (Fox Chase Cancer Center, USA) corresponding to murine genes. Slides were pre-hybridized at 42  C for approximately 6 hours in a solution containing Denhardt   s 5X (Ficoll 400 0.05g/mL, poli-vynil-pyrrolidone 0.05g/mL, bovine serum albumin 0.05g/mL), SSC (sodium saline citrate) 5X, 0.2% SDS (Sigma), and 1% BSA.For hybridization, we used a mix of 3.5  g of each labeled sample aRNA and reference aRNA. The hybridization solution contained Denhardt   s 5X, formamide 25% (Sigma), SSC 5X, SDS 0.1%, salmon sperm DNA 0.1mg/mL (GE Healthcare), Poly-A 0.1mg/mL (GE Healthcare), and Cot-1 0.1mg/mL (GE Healthcare), to a final volume of 100  L. Hybridizations were carried out on a Gene Tac hybridization station (Genomic Solutions) at 42  C for about 16h.The slides were removed from the hybridization cassettes directly to a recipient containing a washing solution (SSC 2X, SDS 0.1%) at 42  C, put in a slide rack, transferred to another recipient containing fresh solution, and washed under constant agitation at 42  C for 5 min. After that, they were washed twice for 5min in a second wash solution (SSC 0.1X, SDS 0.1%) at room temperature and rinsed five times for 1min at room temperature with a SSC 0.1X solution. The slides were dried upside down in a centrifuge at 1500rpm for 5min.The slides were scanned with a confocal laser scanner (ScanArrayTM Express, Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, USA), and the spot intensities processed with the help of the ScanArray Express program (Packard BioScience), with a 10  m resolution and a PMT of 60% for Alexa 555 and of 70% for Alexa 647.

Here we used genomic signatures to predict involvement of specific E2F transcription factors in Myc-induced tumors.  We genetically tested this prediction by interbreeding Myc transgenics with mice lacking various activator E2F alleles.  Tumor latency decreased in the E2F1 mutant background and significantly increased in both the E2F2 and E2F3 mutants.  Investigating the mechanism behind these changes revealed a reduction in apoptosis in the E2F1 knockout strain.  E2F2 and E2F3 mutant backgrounds alleviated Myc effects on the mammary gland, reducing the susceptible tumor target population.   Gene expression data from tumors revealed that the E2F2 knockout background resulted in fewer tumors with EMT, corresponding with a reduction in probability of Ras activation.  In human breast cancer we found that a low probability of E2F2 pathway activation was associated with increased relapse-free survival time.  Together these data illustrate the predictive utility of genomic signatures in deciphering the heterogeneity within breast cancer and illustrate the unique genetic requirements for individual E2Fs in mediating tumorigenesis in both mouse models and human breast cancer. MMTV-Myc tumors were generated in an E2F wild-type, E2F1 null, E2F2 null and E2F3 heterozygous background.

We have developed a mouse model of FASD that involves moderate ethanol exposure throughout gestation achieved by voluntary maternal consumption.  This model results in phenotypes relevant to FASD.  Since ethanol is known to directly affect the expression of genes in the developing brain leading to abnormal cell death, changes to cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and potential changes to epigenetic patterning, we hypothesize that this leaves a long-term footprint on the adult brain.  However, the long-term effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on brain gene expression, when behavioural phenotypes are apparent, are unclear. We used a microarray experiment and focused on the genes identified by both to evaluate the genome-wide alterations to the adult brain transcriptome caused by prenatal ethanol exposure. To generate samples, female C57BL/6J mice were given ethanol injections (2.5g/kg of ethanol in saline) twice on gestational days 8 and 11 to produce acute ethanol exposure effects.

Nicotine, a major teratogen present in tobacco products, was shown to cause alterations and delays in the developing fetus. To demonstrate the effect of nicotine on craniofacial development, particularly palatogenesis, we delivered three different doses of nicotine (1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 mg/kg/day) into pregnant BALB/c mice throughout their entire pregnancy using subcutaneous osmotic mini-pump. We assessed the pups for morphological anomalies, as well as genome-wide mRNA (transcriptome) microarray analysis. Consistent administration of nicotine caused developmental retardation, still birth, low birth weight, and significant palatal size and shape abnormality in the pups. However, it did not cause obvious cleft palate. The microarray data analysis using IPA identified differential expression of genes involved in various biological pathways, particularly cancer, genetic diseases, and tissue development in response to consistent nicotine exposure. 6232 up-regulated and 6310 down-regulated genes were detected in nicotine-treated groups compared to the control. Moreover, 45% of the genes associated with cleft palate were found to be affected by nicotine. Alterations of a subset of differentially expressed genes were illustrated with hierarchal clustering and RT-PCR. We concluded that consistent nicotine exposure during pregnancy interferes with normal growth and development of the fetus including palatogenesis; however, this interference does not result in cleft palate, rather smaller palate size with persistent MES. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment revealing the impact of nicotine on the fetal palate transcriptome in mice. Total 8 samples were analyzed.

The following abstract from the submitted manuscript describes the major findings of this work.  The Nuclear Receptor Transcription Factor PPARbeta/delta Programs Muscle Glucose Metabolism. Zhenji Gan, Eileen Burkart-Hartman, Dong-Ho Han, Brian Finck, Teresa C. Leone, John Holloszy, and Daniel P. Kelly.  To identify new gene regulatory pathways controlling skeletal muscle energy metabolism, comparative studies were conducted on muscle-specific transgenic mouse lines expressing the nuclear receptors, PPARalpha (MCK-PPARalpha) or PPARbeta/delta (MCK-PPARbeta/delta).  MCK-PPARbeta/delta mice are known to have enhanced exercise performance whereas MCK-PPARalpha mice perform at low levels. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh)b/Ldha gene expression ratio is increased in MCK-PPARbeta/delta muscle, an isoenzyme shift that diverts pyruvate into the mitochondrion for the final steps of glucose oxidation. PPARbeta/delta gain- and loss-of-function studies in skeletal myotubes demonstrated that PPARbeta/delta, but not PPARalpha, interacts with the exercise inducible kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), to synergistically activate Ldhb gene transcription by cooperating with myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A), in a PPARbeta/delta ligand-independent manner. MCK-PPARbeta/delta muscle was shown to have high glycogen stores, increased levels of GLUT4, and augmented capacity for mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation suggesting a broad reprogramming of glucose utilization pathways. Lastly, exercise studies demonstrated that MCK-PPARbeta/delta mice had lower circulating levels of lactate compared to non-transgenic controls, while exhibiting supranormal performance on a high intensity exercise regimen. These results identify a transcriptional regulatory mechanism that increases capacity for muscle glucose utilization in a pattern that resembles the effects of exercise training.

We have developed a mouse moder of FASD that involves moderate ethanol exposure throughout gestation achieved by voluntary maternal consumption.  This model results in phenotypes relevant to FASD.  Since ethanol is known to directly affect the expression of genes in the developing brain leading to abnormal cell death, changes to cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and potential changes to epigenetic patterning, we hypothesize that this leaves a long-term footprint on the adult brain.  However, the long-term effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on brain gene expression, when behavioural phenotypes are apparent, are unclear. We used two independent microarray experiments and focused on the genes identified by both to evaluate the genome-wide alterations to the adult brain transcriptome caused by prenatal ethanol exposure via moderate maternal drinking. To generate samples, two independent groups of female C57BL/6J mice were given access to 10% ethanol in water or water only.  Control females had access to water only.  Females were mated and continued to drink from gestational day 0 to pup postnatal day 10.  Whole brain RNA from adult (postnatal day 70) male ethanol-exposed offspring was extracted.

One such pathway is mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis, and the NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1.  Here we show that NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis is severely compromised in metabolic organs by high-fat diet (HFD).  Strikingly, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a product of the NAMPT reaction and a key NAD+ intermediate, ameliorates glucose intolerance by restoring NAD+ levels in HFD-induced T2D mice.  NMN also enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity and restores gene expression related to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and circadian rhythm, partly through SIRT1 activation.  Furthermore, NAD+ and NAMPT levels show significant decreases in multiple organs during aging, and NMN improves glucose intolerance and lipid profiles in age-induced T2D mice.  These findings provide critical insights into a novel intervention against diet- and age-induced T2D. 4 regular chow fed mice (RC1-4) vs 4 high-fat diet fed (HFD) (HFD1a-4a) mice were analyzed on one chip (Chip-A). 4 HFD mice (HFD1b-4b) vs 4 HFD-NMN treated mice (NMN1-4) were examined on the other chip (Chip-B). .. female;  total RNA;  Liver, HFD+NMN treatment;  Liver, high fat diet (HFD);  Liver, regular chow-fed;  C57BL/6J;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  For NMN treatment, NMN was intraperitoneally given to HFD-mice for seven days.;

Individual Fos proteins have been thoroughly studied in gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, which revealed important functions in bone cell proliferation and differentiation. We have recently demonstrated that loss of Fra-2 causes perinatal lethality and severe osteopenia due to several cellular defects, including a chondrocyte differentiation defect and a control of osteoclast survival and size. Moreover, we have reported a profibrogenic function of Fra-2 in transgenic mice, in which ectopic expression of Fra-2 in various organs resulted in generalized fibrosis with predominant manifestations in the lung. Fra-2 knock-out newborns have increased numbers and size of osteoclasts in vivo. The pulmonary phenotype observed in Fra-2Tg mice is characterized by vascular remodeling and obliteration of pulmonary arteries, which coincides with expression of osteopontin, an AP-1 target gene involved in vascular remodeling and fibrogenesis.

It is not known how the intermingled cell types of individual brain regions differ in their expressed genomes. Here we describe an atlas of cell type transcriptomes of the adult retina. We found that each adult cell type expresses a specific set of genes, including a unique set of transcription factors, forming a    barcode    for cell identity. Cell type transcriptomes carry enough information to categorize cells into corresponding morphological classes and types. Surprisingly, several barcode genes are eye disease-associated genes that we demonstrate to be specifically expressed not only in photoreceptors but also in particular retinal circuit elements such as inhibitory neurons as well as in retinal microglia. Our data suggest that distinct cell types of individual brain regions are characterized by marked differences in their expressed genomes. To obtain insight into the developmental time course of adult cell type-specific gene expression, we followed gene expression in one amacrine cell group, Arc cells, for 20 postnatal days (P) starting at P1. Qualitative analysis of the expression time-course of cell type-specific genes revealed four patterns: increasing, decreasing or constant expression from P1 to P20, or a biphasic time-course (constant and increasing) with a switch at P9-P10. At this latter time point, bipolar cells begin to form synapses with amacrine and ganglion cells and the retina becomes light responsive. Pairwise correlations across the transcriptomes measured on each day exposed two major clusters, from P1 to P9 and from P10 to P20, which also suggested a transcriptional switch during the transition from P9 to P10. Thus, most adult cell type-specific genes are also expressed during development but at levels different to those in the adult. We performed gene expression analysis of one amacrine cell group, Arc, from P0 to P20 and for Starburst amacrine cells for the time point P3 and P18.

Treatment with HGF has been shown to accelerate resolution of fibrotic liver lesions in experimental animal models. To formally address the importance of c-Met signaling in hepatocytes in the context of chronic liver injury, we have used hepatocyte-specific Metfl/fl;Alb-Cre+/- conditional knockout mice (KO) and  a model of liver fibrosis.  Methods: CCl4 was administrated biweekly over a period of 4 weeks (injury phase), and the animals were followed over the next 4 weeks (healing phase). Macroscopic and microscopic changes during the injury and healing phases were monitored by IHC. Deposition of ECM was assessed by Sirius red staining and hydroxiproline content.  Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) was estimated by a-SMA using WB and IHC. Expression levels of the selected key fibrotic molecules were evaluated by RT-qPCR and WB. Time-dependent global transcriptomic changes from whole livers and isolated hepatocytes were examined using gene expression microarrays.  Results: Loss of HGF/c-Met signaling in hepatocytes altered the hepatic microenvironment and dramatically aggravated hepatic fibrogenesis. Increased liver damage was associated with decreased hepatocyte proliferation, progressive accumulation of HSCs, and delayed fibrinolysis causing increased collagen deposit. Dystrophic calcification of necrotic areas impaired phagocytosis, resulting in sustained inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling further augmenting severity of fibrogenesis. Global gene-expression analysis demonstrated upregulation of key fibrogenic molecules, such as Tgf-     and Pdgf-    , paralleled by a decreased expression of genes important for cell cycle, stress response and regeneration, which could be attributed to the c-Met deficiency in hepatocytes.  Additionally, key chemotactic and inflammatory cytokines, including Ccl2, SDF1/Cxcr4 and Spp1, were upregulated in Metfl/fl;Alb-Cre+/- hepatocytes. However, the major pro-fibrotic signaling originated from the non-parenchymal cell compartments, as revealed by cell type-specific gene expression signatures.  Conclusion: These results indicate that lack of c-Met signaling in hepatocytes disrupts the balance between extracellular matrix production and degradation and establish a protective role for c-Met against adverse microenvironment leading to the development of fibrotic liver disease. In the present study, we reported a detailed and comprehensive dynamic characterization of the cellular and molecular alterations involved in fibrosis in the liver of c-Met transgenic mice.

The results showed a progressive increase in differential gene activities with the number of cell passages.  We detected 101 differentially expressed genes in the early passage and 668 in the immortalized Smurf2KO cells, with 49 in common between these two categories.  These data pointed to a global deregulation of gene expression as the cells became immortalized in the absence of Smurf2.

Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep-sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein  synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit  the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation  together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of  translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and novel  translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open  reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose  translation changes after differentiation. We also define a new class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated  complexity to mammalian proteomes.

In order to ascertain functional roles for Foxp1 in the CNS, we have identified gene targets for Foxp1 in vitro using gene expression microarrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) assays.  Transcriptome-wide analysis of Foxp1-transfected striatal cells revealed widespread expression changes of genes related to immune signaling, cancer, transcriptional regulation, and a curated Huntington   s disease (HD) signaling pathway.   Integrating the microarray expression dataset with Foxp1 binding sequences determined from ChIP-seq analysis resulted in 75 direct targets of Foxp1, which included Foxp1 itself, which were also related to immune processes and the category    genetic disorder   .

Although immune mechanisms are known to control the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the role of DCs remains elusive. Here we show that Ccl17 expressing mature, myeloid DCs accumulate within atherosclerotic lesions. Deletion of Ccl17 in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice reduces the development and progression of atherosclerosis in several disease models. While Ccl17 expression by DCs dampened antigen-specific T cell proliferation, it is required for efficient polarization of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 as reflected by a preponderance of Th2 cytokines in Ccl17-/- Apoe-/- mice. In line with these findings, only transfer of T cells from Apoe-/-, but not from Ccl17-/- Apoe-/- precipitated atherosclerosis in T cell depleted Apoe-/- recipients. These findings identify Ccl17+ DCs as central immune regulators in atherosclerosis and Ccl17 as a potential target in the treatment of this disease.

This suggests that the properties of dermal fibroblasts change during postnatal development. To examine this, we used a PdgfraEGFP mouse line to isolate GFP-positive fibroblasts from neonatal skin, adult telogen and anagen skin and adult skin in which ectopic hair follicles had been induced (EF skin) by transgenic epidermal activation of beta-catenin. We also isolated epidermal cells from each mouse. The gene expression profile of EF epidermis was most similar to that of anagen epidermis, consistent with activation of beta-catenin signalling. In contrast, adult dermis with ectopic hair follicles more closely resembled neonatal dermis than adult telogen or anagen dermis. In particular, genes associated with mitosis were upregulated and extracellular matrix-associated genes were downregulated in neonatal and EF fibroblasts. We confirmed that sustained epidermal beta-catenin activation stimulated fibroblasts to proliferate to reach the high cell density of neonatal skin. In addition, the extracellular matrix was comprehensively remodelled, with mature collagen being replaced by collagen subtypes normally present only in developing skin. The changes in proliferation and extracellular matrix composition originated from a specific subpopulation of fibroblasts located beneath the sebaceous gland. Our results show that adult dermis is an unexpectedly plastic tissue that can be reprogrammed to acquire the molecular, cellular and structural characteristics of neonatal dermis in response to cues from the overlying epidermis.

Our  studies, and those of others, investigating the pathologies associated with infection with the helminth Schistosoma japonicum implicate a role for AAM  s in fibrosis and immunomodulation.. In the present study we show  that S. japonicum-secreted egg antigens are able to induce the alternative activation of macrophages as characterised by the induction of Chi3l3 and Arg1 expression. Retnla, another common marker of AAM  s, was not consistently induced in these macrophages suggesting that the specific function of these cells may differ to those induced by S. mansoni and other parasites. Closer examination of the gene expression profile and functionality of these cells identified pathways independent of Retnla expression that could  be important for their immunomodulatory activity such as modulating expression of T-cell co-stimulatory molecules and chemokines. In vivo generated S. japonicum soluble egg antigen stimulated AAM  s also exhibited a reduction in their phagocytic ability likely related to the induction of IL4 and decreased expression of cell surface receptors. Additionally these macrophages exhibited reduced  expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and an associated reduction in responsiveness to stimulation with TLR ligands. We did not observe pathways that would suggest that  AAM  s have a direct profibrotic activity. Taken together, these data describe a mechanism by which alternative activation of macrophages may be induced during S. japonicum infection and highlight the importance of the context of activation in directing AAM   phenotype and function. The gene expression profile of Schistosoma japonicum soluble egg antigen (SEA)-stimulated macrophages was compared with that of PBS stimulated controls. Macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice (n=6 per group) stimulated by intraperitoneal injection with SEA or PBS.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of preconditioning, we compared brain and blood genomic profiles in response to preconditioning with these TLR ligands and to preconditioning via exposure to brief ischemia.

This in vivo heterogeneity is also amplified by the different experimental strategies used to isolate/culture them. Among the exogenous factors described to affect MSC in vitro growth, basic-fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is one of the most common growth factors used to expand stem cells. Moreover, it has been reported that its signaling is associated with the mainteinance of stemness of a variety of stem cells, included MSC. Using an ectopic model of bone regeneration, we have previously described that the implantation of cells with different commitment levels, differentially influences the capacity to recruit host cells, activating endogenous regenerative mechanisms. Due to its properties, we here demonstrate that the addition of bFGF to primary BM cultures, leads to the selection of specific subpopulations able to induce a different host regenerative response, when in vivo implanted in association with suitable ceramic scaffolds. Moreover, taking advantage of a multiparametric and comparative genomic and proteomic approach, it has been evaluated how different culture conditions combine to bring about appreciable changes in the secretome of the cells, that consequently influence their in vivo regenerative behaviour. The full comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms that rule the host response depending on the type and differentiative stage of the transplanted cells could help us to develop novel clinical strategies where host cells could directly contribute to regenerate the appropriate tissue.

A possible strategy to overcome Treg cell suppression focuses on OX40, a costimulatory molecule expressed constitutively by Treg cells while induced in activated effector T (Teff) cells. OX40 stimulation by the agonist mAb OX86 inhibits Treg cell suppression and boosts Teff cell activation. Here we uncover the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of OX86 treatment dissecting its distinct effects on Treg and on effector memory T (Tem) cells, which are the most abundant CD4+ populations strongly expressing OX40 at the tumor site. In response to OX86, tumor-infiltrating Treg cells produced significantly less interleukin 10 (IL-10), possibly in relation to a decrease in the transcription factor IRF1. Tem cells responded to OX86 by upregulating surface CD40L expression, providing a licensing signal to dendritic cells (DCs). The CD40L/CD40 axis was required for Tem cell-mediated in vitro DC maturation and in vivo DC migration. Accordingly, OX86 treatment was no longer therapeutic in CD40 KO mice. In conclusion, following OX40 stimulation, blockade of Treg cell suppression and enhancement of the Tem cell adjuvant effect both concurred to free DCs from immunosuppression and to activate the immune response against the tumor.

Here we use global mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (CHIP-seq) to investigate the changes that occur in mRNA levels, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy and multiple post-translational histone modifications when erythroid progenitors differentiate into late erythroblasts. Among genes induced during this developmental transition, there was an increase in the occupancy of Pol II, the activation marks H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9Ac and H4K16Ac, and the elongation methylation mark H3K79me2. In contrast, genes that were repressed during differentiation showed relative decreases in H3K79me2 levels yet had levels of Pol II binding and active histone marks similar to those in erythroid progenitors. We also found that relative changes in histone modification levels-in particular, H3K79me2 and H4K16ac-were most predictive of gene expression patterns. Our results suggest that in terminal erythropoiesis both promoter and elongation-associated marks contribute to the induction of erythroid genes, while gene repression is marked by changes in histone modifications mediating Pol II elongation. Our data maps the epigenetic landscape of terminal erythropoiesis and suggests that control of transcription elongation regulates gene expression during terminal erythroid differentiation.

Blood vessels have been shown to be essential for early development of the liver and pancreas, and are fundamental to normal and pathological tissue growth. Here we report that non-nutritional signals from blood vessels surprisingly act to restrain pancreas growth. Elimination of endothelial cells increases the size of embryonic pancreatic buds. Conversely, VEGF-induced hypervascularization decreases pancreas size. The growth phenotype results from vascular restriction of pancreatic tip cell formation, lateral branching and differentiation of the pancreatic epithelium into endocrine and acinar cells. The effects are seen both in vivo and ex vivo, indicating a perfusion-independent mechanism. Thus the vasculature controls pancreas morphogenesis and growth by reducing branching and differentiation of primitive epithelial cells.

Myostatin levels in muscles of adult male mice with floxed myostatin genes were reduced ~85% by activating Cre recombinase. Control mice with normal myostatin genes had the same Cre-activating treatment. Some of the mice were housed in ordinary cages throughout the study, limiting their physical activity. Other mice were given free access to running wheels for the final 12 weeks of the study. At the end of the study, comprehensive gene expression profiles of triceps brachii muscles were determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), with muscles from mice selected for similarity of running behavior throughout the period of wheel access. Wheel running increased expression of hundreds of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in oxidative energy metabolism, and this response was not affected by myostatin deficiency. The running-induced increase in the ratio of Myh1 mRNA (which encodes myosin heavy chain type 2x) to Myh4 mRNA (which encodes myosin heavy chain type 2b) also was not affected by myostatin depletion. At every threshold of P (computed by analysis of variance), the number of transcripts with interactions between activity level and myostatin level was fewer than the number expected by chance.

We therefore quantified cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations in intestine and liver and determined fecal neutral sterol and bile acid excretion in C57Bl/6N mice fed for 12 weeks either a cholesterol-free high carbohydrate control diet or a high fat diet containing 0.03 % (w/w) cholesterol. To identify underlying mechanisms of dietary adaptation in intestine and liver, changes in gene expression were assessed by microarray and qPCR profiling, respectively.  Results Animals on high fat diet showed increased plasma cholesterol levels, associated with the higher dietary cholesterol supply, yet, significantly reduced cholesterol levels were found in intestine and liver. Transcript profiling revealed evidence that expression of numerous genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake via LDL, but also in phospholipid metabolism, underwent compensatory regulations in both tissues. Alterations in glycerophospholipid metabolism were confirmed at the metabolite level by phospolipid profiling via mass spectrometry.  Conclusions Our findings suggest that intestine and liver react to a high dietary fat intake by an activation of de novo cholesterol synthesis and other cholesterol-saving mechanisms, as well as with major changes in phospholipid metabolism, to accommodate to the fat load.

Whilst oocyte quality is known to decay with somatic aging it is not a given that different biological functions decay concurrently. In this study we tested whether oocyte reprogramming ability decreases with somatic aging. We show that oocytes isolated from mice aged beyond the usual reproductive age (climacteric) yield ooplasts that retain reprogramming capacity after somatic nuclear transfer (SCNT) at levels similar to ooplasts of young donors. Despite differences in transcriptome between ooplasts of old and young mice gene expression profiles of the resultant SCNT blastocysts were very similar. Furthermore albeit results showing global down-regulation of apoptosis-related genes in climacteric ooplasts and the reported beneficial effect of inhibiting p53 on transcription factor-induced (iPS) pluripotency reprogramming capacity of young ooplasts was not affected by specifically blocking p53. Our observations strongly suggest that the outcome of oocyte-induced reprogramming is determined by the availability of intrinsic reprogramming factors tightly regulated throughout aging as well as intracellular and environmental checkpoints during pre-implantation development towards selection of the successfully reprogrammed embryos. While oocytes are not regenerated but rather last for life we further propose that these cells can still be a resource for somatic reprogramming when they cease to be considered safe for sexual reproduction. Total mRNA was isolated for samples from young and climacteric mice (pools of 20 ooplasts and 20 SCNT blastocysts in duplicate) using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Valencia CA USA) as described by the manufacturer (no DNase treatment). RNA concentrations as well as purity and integrity check were determined with Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA Pico 6000 Lab-Chip Kit (Agilent Technologies Palo Alto CA USA). RiboAmp HS Plus Amplification Kit (MDS Analytical Technologies Ismaning Germany) was used to amplify the total mRNA with two rounds of amplification according to the manufacturer  ??s instructions.

Turbo Labeling CY3 Kit (MDS Analytical Technologies) was used to label 3     g of amplified RNA with Cy3. Concentration and frequency of incorporation were measured with NanoPhotometer (Implen). Microarray wash and detection of the labeled RNA on GeneChips were carried out according to the manufacturer  ??s instructions (Agilent Technologies). Gene expression profiling was performed using Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays (4 x 44k each array containing 41174 features).

We found that short and long 3   UTR isoforms were relatively more abundant when genes were highly and lowly expressed, respectively, in human and mouse cells. Consistently, upregulated and downregulated genes were more likely to have shortened and lengthened 3   UTRs, respectively, when genes changed expression under different cell conditions or in response to extracellular stimuli. Using nuclear run-on assays, we found that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was more likely to pause at the polyA site of highly expressed genes than that of lowly expressed ones. Moreover, in line with the difference in polyA site usage, highly expressed genes tend to have higher H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 levels but a lower density of nucleosome around promoter-proximal polyA sites relative to distal ones. Taken together, our results indicate that the efficiency of 3    end processing is generally coupled to transcriptional activity, leading to modulation of polyA site choice by transcription and thus connecting transcriptional control with post-transcriptional regulation via pre-mRNA processing.

ERVs are germline encoded, transmitted in a Mendelian fashion and account for about 8% of the human and 9.9% of the murine genome, respectively1, 2. By spontaneous activation and reintegration ERVs may cause insertional mutagenesis and thus participate in the process of malignant transformation or progression of tumor growth3, 4. However, if the innate immune system is able to recognize and control ERVs has not yet been elucidated. Here we report that, in vitro, nucleic-acid sensing TLRs on dendritic cells are activated by retroviral RNA and DNA from infected cells in vitro. Infection of TLR competent wild type mice with murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-like ERV isolates results in non-canonical gene upregulation, independent of type I IFN. In vivo, TLR3, -7 and -9 triple deficient mice (TLR379-/-) and mice with non functional TLR3, 7 and 9 signaling due to a mutation in UNC93B develop spontaneous ERV-induced viremia. More importantly, in TLR379-/- mice ERV-induced viremia correlates with acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Multiple independent TLR379-/- T cell leukemia lines produce infectious MuLV of endogenous origin. These cell lines display de novo retroviral integration into the Nup214 or Notch1 gene locus leading to gene dysregulation that is reminiscent of aberrant Nup214 and Notch1 expression in human T-ALLs5. Overall, our results demonstrate that in addition to their role in innate immune defense against exogenous pathogens, TLR3,-7, and -9 may be essential for the control of endogenous retroviral mediated T-cell lymphomagenesis. The data covers two data sets. The data set covers two comparisons of the expression profile from old and young TLR379-/- knockout. Spleen was taken from and old wild type (C57BL/6 background) to compare it against an old TLR379-/- knockout and also from an young wild type (C57BL/6 background) to compare it against a young TLR379-/- knockout.

Extinction of fear memories has been implicated with the treatment of anxiety disease but the molecular processes that underlie fear extinctionare only beginning to emerge. Here we show that fear extinction initiates up-regulation of hippocampal insulin-growth factor 2 (Igf2) and down-regulation of insulin-growth factor binding protein 7 (Igfbp7). In line with this observation we demonstrate that IGF2 facilitates fear extinction, while IGFBP7 impairs fear extinction in an IGF2-dependent manner. Furthermore, we identify one cellular substrate of altered IGF2-signaling during fear extinction. To this end we show that fear extinction-induced IGF2/IGFBP7-signaling promotes the survival of 17-19 day-old newborn hippocampal neurons. In conclusion, our data suggests that therapeutic strategies that enhance IGF2-signaling and adult neurogenesis might be suitable to treat disease linked to excessive fear memory. We employed mice to investigate fear extinction in the hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning paradigm. To this end, male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to the fear conditioning box (context) followed by an electric foot-shock which elicits the acquisition of conditioned contextual fear. For extinction training animals were repeatedly reexposed to the conditioned context on consecutive days (24h interval) without receiving the footshockagain (extinction trial, E). This procedure eventually results in the decline of the aversive freezing behavior. Mice that were exposed to the conditioning context without receiving fear conditioning training served as control groups. To gain a better understanding of the molecular processes underlying fear extinction we performed a genome-wide analysis of the hippocampal transcriptome during fear extinction. In the employed paradigm fear extinction is a gradual process. To capture the longitudinal course of fear extinction we decided to perform hippocampal microarray analysis at two time points: (1) After the first extinction trial (E1) when animals display high levels of aversive freezing behavior and (2) at the extinction trial on which the freezing behavior was significantly reduced when compared to E1. This extinction trial, in the case of this experiment E5, we termed    extinction trial low freezing    (ELF).

In order to produce a tightly regulated system that was easy to monitor, we constructed two retroviral vectors containing dsRed-linked MLL-AF9 under control of a tetracycline response element promoter, and KrasG12D or NrasG12D linked to the    Tet-off    tet-transactivator, which activates TRE expression in a doxycycline repressible manner. Leukemias were generated by retroviral cotransduction of both vectors into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which were transplanted into syngeneic mice. Cells harboring both constructs induced aggressive myelomonocytic leukemia. Five independent primary leukemia cell lines were established from bone marrow of terminal mice. Treatment of these lines with doxycycline rapidly turned off MLL-AF9 expression, and induced terminal myeloid differentiation and complete disease remission in vivo. To identify molecular mechanisms underlying addiction to MLL-AF9, we analyzed global gene expression changes following doxycycline-induced suppression of MLL-AF9. Independent primary acute myeloid leukemia lines induced by cotransduction of Tet-off MLL-AF9 together with either KrasG12D or NrasG12D were grown in culture and treated with doxycycline for 6 days to inactivate MLL-AF9 expression. In addition, primary acute myeloid leukemia lines with constitutive MLL-AF9 and KrasG12D were included to control for the effects of doxycycline.

Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. While chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amendable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been hampered by our limited understanding of cancer-specific epigenetic dependencies. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)     an aggressive hematopoietic malignancy often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom shRNA library targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the bromodomain-containing protein Brd4 as a critical requirement for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust anti-leukemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation. Extensive evaluation of JQ1-sensitivity in primary human leukemia samples and in established cell lines revealed a broad activity of this compound against diverse AML subtypes. These effects are, at least in part, due to a requirement for Brd4 in maintaining Myc expression and promoting aberrant self-renewal. Together, our results indicate that Brd4 is a promising therapeutic target in AML and identify a small molecule that efficiently targets Myc. These findings also highlight the utility of RNAi screening as a discovery platform for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities for direct pharmacologic intervention in cancer. In order to understand downstream targets of Brd4, we performed array in murine or human MLL-AF9/NrasG12D cell line under the condition that Brd4 was suppressed by using shRNAs or the small molecule inhibitor JQ1. To test the hypothesis that Myc might be an important target of Brd4, we performed arrary on murine ectopic Myc overexpression MLL-AF9/NrasG12D cell under JQ1 treatment. ..

In the developing heart, Twist1 is highly expressed in endocardial cushion (ECC) valve mesenchymal cells and is down regulated during valve differentiation and remodeling.  Previous studies demonstrated that Twist1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and expression of primitive ECM molecules in ECC mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, Twist1 expression is induced in human pediatric and adult diseased heart valves.  However, the Twist1 downstream target genes that mediate increased cell proliferation and migration during early heart valve development remain largely unknown.  Candidate gene and global gene profiling approaches were used to identify direct transcriptional targets of Twist1 during heart valve development.  Candidate target genes were analyzed for evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) containing E-box consensus sequences that are potential Twist1 binding sequences.   ECRs containing conserved E-box sequences were identified for Twist1 responsive genes Tbx20, Cdh11, Sema3C, Rab39b, and Gadd45a.  Twist1 binding to these sequences in vivo was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and binding was detected in ECCs but not late stage remodeling valves.  In addition identified Twist1 target genes are highly expressed in ECCs and have reduced expression during heart valve remodeling in vivo which is consistent with the expression pattern of Twist1. Together these analyses identify multiple new genes involved in cell proliferation and migration that are differentially expressed in the developing heart valves, are responsive to Twist1 transcriptional function, and contain Twist1 responsive regulatory sequences. Murine MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells were treated with siScrambled control or siTwist1 to achieve knockdown of Twist1. Both siScr and siTwist1 were performed in triplicate.

C/EBPb is required for oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) of primary fibroblasts, but also displays pro-oncogenic functions in many tumour cells. Here, we show that C/EBPb activation by H-RasV12 is suppressed in immortalized/transformed cells, but not in primary cells, by its 30 untranslated region (30UTR). 30UTR sequences inhibited Ras-induced cytostatic activity of C/EBPb, DNA binding, transactivation, phosphorylation, and homodimerization, without significantly affecting protein expression. The 30UTR suppressed induction of senescence-associated C/EBPb target genes, while promoting expression of genes linked to cancers and TGFb signalling. An AU-rich element (ARE) and its cognate RNA-binding protein, HuR, were required for 30UTR inhibition. These components also excluded the Cebpb mRNA from a perinuclear cytoplasmic region that contains activated ERK1/2, indicating that the site of C/EBPb translation controls de-repression by Ras signalling. Notably, 30UTR inhibition and Cebpb mRNA compartmentalization were absent in primary fibroblasts, allowing Ras-induced C/EBPb activation and OIS to proceed.

Although the biochemical, structural and functional properties of myofibers have been the subject of intense investigation for the last decades, understanding molecular processes regulating fiber type diversity is still complicated by the heterogeneity of cell types present in the whole muscle organ. Methodology/Principal Findings: we have produced a first catalogue of genes expressed in mouse slow-oxidative (type 1) and fast-glycolytic (type 2B) fibers through transcriptome analysis at the single fiber level (microgenomics). Individual fibers were obtained from murine soleus and EDL muscles and initially classified by myosin heavy chain isoform content. Gene expression profiling on high density DNA oligonucleotide microarrays showed that both qualitative and quantitative improvements were achieved, compared to results with standard muscle homogenate. First, myofiber profiles were virtually free from non-muscle transcriptional activity. Second, thousands of muscle-specific genes were identified, leading to a better definition of gene signatures in the two fiber types as well as the detection of metabolic and signaling pathways that are differentially activated in specific fiber types. Several regulatory proteins showed preferential expression in slow myofibers. Discriminant analysis revealed novel genes that could be useful for fiber type functional classification. Conclusions/Significance: as gene expression analyses at the single fiber level significantly increased the resolution power, this innovative approach would allow a better understanding of the adaptive transcriptomic transitions occurring in myofibers under physiological and pathological conditions. EDL and soleus muscles were incubated with type I collagenase to dissociate intact myofibres that were separated under stereo microscope from the bulk of hyper contracted fibres. Isolated myofibres were divided in two parts: one was immersed in Laemmli buffer for fibre typing; the other was placed in RNA extraction buffer for RNA amplification. We analyzed the transcription profiles of 10 biological replicas of type 2B single muscle fibres from EDL and 10 biological replicas of type 1 single muscle fibres from soleus. Microarray competitive hybridizations were carried out against an artificial control with a balanced composition of type 1 and type 2B fibres (20 hybridizations). Each oligonucleotide is spotted in two replicates on the glass slide, so for every data two intra-slide replicas are present. The control was created as follows: three couples of soleus and EDL muscles were removed from 3 different mice and treated with collagenase. Total RNA was extracted separately from EDL and soleus muscles. By mixing about 1/3 RNA from EDL and 2/3 RNA from soleus muscles the control had approximately the same contributions of type 1 and type 2B fibres.

We previously reported that EAAT2 is cleaved by caspase-3 at the cytosolic C-terminus domain, impairing the transport activity and generating a proteolytic fragment found to be SUMO1 conjugated (CTE-SUMO1). We show here that this fragment accumulates in the nucleus of spinal cord astrocytes in vivo throughout the disease stages of the SOD1-G93A mouse model of ALS. In vitro expression in spinal cord astrocytes of the C-terminus peptide of EAAT2 (CTE), which was artificially fused to SUMO1 (CTE-SUMO1fus) to mimic the endogenous SUMOylation reaction, recapitulates the nuclear accumulation of the fragment seen in vivo and causes caspase-3 activation and axonal growth impairment in motor neuron-derived NSC-34 cells and primary motor neurons co-cultured with CTE-SUMO1fus-expressing spinal cord astrocytes. This indicates that CTE-SUMO1fus could trigger non-cell autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Prolonged nuclear accumulation of CTE-SUMO1fus in astrocytes leads to their degeneration, although the time frame of the cell-autonomous toxicity is longer than the one for the indirect toxic effect on motor neurons. As more evidence on the implication of SUMO substrates in neurodegenerative diseases emerges, our observations strongly suggest that the nuclear accumulation in spinal cord astrocytes of a SUMOylated proteolytic fragment of the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 could take part to the pathogenesis of ALS and suggest a novel, unconventional role for EAAT2 in motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Comparison is made between the toxic fragment (SUMO) and the same fragment without lysines that can be sumo-ylated (CTE). Four replicates have been performed for each sample group. ..

It has been proposed that the presence of such pro-metastatic events in early-stage tumors reflects their additional capability to function as oncogenes.  Here, to test this    deterministic    hypothesis and identify potential pro-metastasis oncogenes, we adopted a comparative oncogenomics-guided functional genetic screening strategy involving (i) global transcriptomic data from two genetically engineered mouse models of melanoma with contrasting metastatic potential, (ii) genomic and transcriptomic profiles of human primary and metastatic melanoma and (iii) an invasion screen in TERT-immortalized human melanocytes and melanoma cells in vitro as well as (iv) evidence of expression selection in human melanoma tissues. This integrated effort led to the identification of 6 genes that are both potently pro-invasive and oncogenic.  Further, we show that one such pro-invasion oncogene, ACP5, can confer spontaneous metastasis in vivo, engages a key pathway governing metastasis and is prognostic in human primary melanomas. The tetracycline-inducible MET-driven mouse (iMet) model (Tyr-rtTA;Tet-Met;Ink4a/Arf-/-) was constructed similar to the previously described iHRAS* model (Tyr-rtTA;Tet-HRASV12G;Ink4a/Arf-/-). RNA from cutaneous melanomas derived from iMet (n=6) or iHRAS* (n=6) models were profiled on Affymetrix M430A_2 chips and resultant transcriptomes were compared to generate a phenotype-based (metastatic capable or not) differentially expressed gene list.

However, the mechanism for this survival and protection remains unresolved. We have recently identified a mouse Sertoli cell line (MSC-1) that lacks some of the immunoprotective abilities associated with primary SC. The objective of this study was to compare the survival and gene expression profiles of primary SC and MSC-1 cells to identify factors or immune-related pathways potentially important for SC immune privilege. Primary SC or MSC-1 cells were transplanted as allografts to the renal subcapsular area of na  ve BALB/c mice and cell survival was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, transcriptome differences were investigated by microarray and pathway analyses. While primary SC were detected within the grafts with 100% graft survival throughout the 20-day study, MSC-1 cells w  ere rejected between 11 and 14 days with 0% graft survival at 20 days post-transplantation. Microarray analysis identified 3198 genes that were differentially expressed with a    4-fold or higher level in primary SC. Cluster and pathway analyses indicate that the mechanism of SC immune privilege is likely complex with multiple immune modulators being involved such as immunosuppressive cytokines and complement inhibitors, lipid mediators for controlling inflammation, and junctional molecules that control leukocyte movement in and out of the immune privileged space. Further study of these immune modulators will increase our understanding of SC immune privilege and in the long-term lead to improvements in transplantation success. We conducted microarray and pathway analyses to identify genes and immune-related pathways differentially regulated by aggregated primary Sertoli cells and MSC-1 cell line.Aggregated 19 to 20-day mice primary Sertoli cells and MSC-1 cell line were used to determine the global transcriptome differences important for the survival and protection of transplanted cells. ..

This process was suggested to coincide with a global increase of repressive heterochromatin, which results in a reduction of transcriptional plasticity and potential. Here we report the dynamics of the transcriptome and an abundant heterochromatic histone modification, dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), during neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells. In contrast to the prevailing model, we find H3K9me2 to occupy over 50% of chromosomal regions already in stem cells. Marked are most genomic regions that are devoid of transcription and a subgroup of histone modifications. Importantly, no global increase occurs during differentiation, but discrete local changes of H3K9me2 particularly at genic regions can be detected. Mirroring the cell fate change many genes show altered expression upon differentiation. Quantitative sequencing of transcripts reveals however that the total number of active genes is equal between stem cells and several tested differentiated cell types. Together, these findings reveal high prevalence of a heterochromatic mark in stem cells and challenge the model of low abundance of epigenetic repression and resulting global transcription in stem cells.  Instead cellular differentiation entails local rather than global changes in epigenetic repression and transcriptional activity. Our dataset comprises of 2 ChIP-seq samples using chromatin from embryonic stem (ES) cells and derived terminal neurons (TN)  which was immunoprecipitated, using antibodies against H3K27me3 and H3K4me2. For the same cells we generated H3K9me2 ChIP-chip samples in biological replicates.

Cells selected in serum-containing culture medium demonstrated unusual N-glycan profiles compared to those prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). These profiles were subsequently shown to result from cellular sequestration of glycoproteins present in fetal calf serum (FCS) used to supplement the medium (1).   Analysis of the N-glycan profile of murine CD4+CD25+ Tregs prepared in PBS revealed distinct differences from CD4+CD25- T cells     namely, a reduction in sialic acid capping and loss of core fucose. Preliminary studies are underway to ascertain the minimum medium required to sustain general T cell survival, whilst maintaining    clean    glycomic profiles. The effect of glycoprotein withdrawal on CD25+ and CD25- CD4+ T cells in culture was investigated by selecting the cells in FCS-free medium and incubating them for six hours with either FCS-containing medium, or PBS supplemented with FCS, fetuin or fetuin-derived glycans. Early apoptosis was measured using Annexin-V (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) and late apoptosis using 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) (BD Biosciences), in parallel with a complementary apoptosis detection method     measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential using the BD    Mitoscreen Kit (BD Biosciences).This apoptosis staining study demonstrated that there was a remarkably higher percentage of death in both CD25+ and CD25- CD4+ T cells cultured in PBS versus cells cultured in RPMI-1640 or medium containing FCS. Both CD25+ and CD25- CD4+ T cells were highly susceptible to apoptosis in glycoprotein-free medium, demonstrating their exquisite sensitivity to the lack of glycoprotein survival factors. Continuing studies are addressing the minimum medium required to sustain cells undergoing polyclonal activation in vitro and the impact of activation on the N-glycan profiles of Tregs versus conventional T cells.

The protooncogene c-Myc enhances the efficiency of iPSC generation by OSK, but it also increases the tumorigenicity of the resulting iPSC. In the current study, we found the Gli-like transcription factor Glis1, when expressed together with OSK, to markedly enhance the generation of iPSC from both mouse and human fibroblasts. Mouse iPSC generated by OSK and Glis1 can form germline-competent chimeras. Glis1 is enriched in unfertilized oocytes and one cell-stage embryos. DNA microarray analyses revealed that Glis1 promotes multiple pro-reprogramming pathways, including Myc, Nanog, Lin28, Wnt, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), and Esrrb. These results therefore demonstrated that oocyte transcription factor Glis1 effectively promote direct reprogramming during iPSC generation. p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transduced with OSK and OSK+Glis1 and were used for microarray analyses. .. embryonic fibroblast;  iPSC from embryonic fibroblast;  p53 null;  total RNA;  p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, retroviral infection, Day5;  10090;  Mus musculus;  OSK;  OSK?Glis1;  Transduction of indicated genes were done by retroviral infection.;

We hypothesized that adverse outcomes from diabetic pregnancies may be linked to compromised placental function.  Our goal in this study was to identify cellular and molecular abnormalities in diabetic placenta.  METHODS: Using a mouse model of diabetic pregnancy, placental gene expression was assayed at midgestation and cellular composition was analyzed at various stages. Genome-wide expression profiling was validated by quantitative PCR, and tissue localization studies were performed to identify cellular correlates of altered gene expression in diabetic placenta.  RESULTS: We detected significantly altered gene expression in diabetic placenta for genes expressed in the maternal as well as those in the embryonic compartments.  We also found altered cellular composition of the decidual compartment. Furthermore, the junctional and labyrinth layers were reduced in diabetic placenta, accompanied by aberrant differentiation of spongiotrophoblast cells.  CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetes during pregnancy alters transcriptional profiles in the murine placenta, affecting cells of both embryonic and maternal origin, and involving several genes not previously implicated in diabetic pregnancies.  The molecular changes and abnormal differentiation of multiple cell types precede impaired growth of junctional zone and labyrinth, and placenta overall.  Whether these changes represent direct responses to hyperglycaemia or physiological adaptations, they are likely to play a role in pregnancy complications and outcomes, and have implications for developmental origins of adult disease. The STZ diabetic mouse model was used to investigate gene expression changes in diabetic placentae at E10.5. Placentae were dissected from 5 different FVB dams at embryonic day 10.5 under diabetic conditions and from 5 control dams. Gene expression profiles from five individual placentae from independent pregnancies per group were compared. ..

However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constitutent cell types. Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-Seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data was projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves      all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the complete transcriptomes of 92 single cells of two distinct types.

Based on global expression analysis, GBM can be classified into distinct subtypes: Proneural, Neural, Classical and Mesenchymal. The signatures of these different tumor subtypes may reflect the phenotypes of cells giving rise to them. However, the experimental evidence connecting any specific subtype of GBM to particular cells of origin is lacking. In addition, it is unclear how different genetic alterations interact with cells of origin in determining tumor heterogeneity. This issue cannot be addressed by studying end-stage human tumors.  Methodology/Principal Findings To address this issue, we used retroviruses to deliver transforming genetic lesions to glial progenitors in adult mouse brain. We compared the resulting tumors to human GBM. We found that different initiating genetic lesions gave rise to tumors with different growth rates. However all mouse tumors closely resembled the human Proneural GBM. Comparative analysis of these mouse tumors allowed us to identify a set of genes whose expression in humans with Proneural GBM correlates with survival.  Conclusions/Significance This study offers insights into the relationship between adult glial progenitors and Proneural GBM, and allows us to identify molecular alterations that lead to more aggressive tumor growth. In addition, we present a new preclinical model that can be used to test treatments directed at a specific type of GBM in future studies. Gene expression profiling was performed on 20 tumors (12 Ptenf/f and 8 Ptenf/f; p53f/f) and 3 normal brains from mice. End stage tumors were used for expression array analysis.

Although DNA methyltransferases have been identified, the factors that establish and contribute to genome-wide methylation patterns remain elusive. Here, we report a high-resolution cytosine methylation map of the murine genome modulated by Lsh, a chromatin remodeling family member that has previously been shown to regulate CpG methylation at repetitive sequences. We provide evidence that Lsh also controls genome-wide cytosine methylation at nonrepeat sequences and relate those changes to alterations in H4K4me3 modification and gene expression. Deletion of Lsh alters the allocation of cytosine methylation in chromosomal regions of 50 kb to 2 Mb and, in addition, leads to changes in the methylation profile at the 5    end of genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that loss of Lsh promotes   as well as prevents   cytosine methylation. Our data indicate that Lsh is an epigenetic modulator that is critical for normal distribution of cytosine methylation throughout the murine genome.

Recent studies demonstrate that brown adipocytes arise in vivo from a Myf5-positive, myoblastic progenitor by the action of PRDM16. Here, we identified a brown fat-enriched miRNA cluster mir-193b-365 as a key regulator of brown fat development. Blocking miR-193b and/or miR-365 in primary brown preadipocytes dramatically impaired brown adipocyte adipogenesis whereas myogenic markers were significantly induced.

Heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatases (sulf-1 and sulf-2) remove 6-O sulfate group from trisulfated disaccharides present on heparan sulfate chains.

Certain chemotherapeutic drugs such as cyclophosphamide can enhance the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapy because of their capacity to modulate innate and adaptive immunity. Indeed, it has been argued that this capacity may be more significant to chemotherapeutic efficacy in general than is presently appreciated. To gain insights into the core mechanisms of chemoimmunotherapy, we methodically profiled the effects of cyclophosphamide on gene expression in bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood, and on cytokine expression in plasma and bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice. Gene and protein expression were modulated early and transiently by cyclophosphamide, leading to upregulation of a variety of immunomodulatory factors, including danger signals, pattern recognition receptors, inflammatory mediators, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors. These factors are involved in sensing cyclophosphamide myelotoxicity and activating repair mechanisms, which, in turn, stimulate immunoactivation events that promote efficacy.

Certain chemotherapeutic drugs such as cyclophosphamide can enhance the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapy because of their capacity to modulate innate and adaptive immunity. Indeed, it has been argued that this capacity may be more significant to chemotherapeutic efficacy in general than is presently appreciated. To gain insights into the core mechanisms of chemoimmunotherapy, we methodically profiled the effects of cyclophosphamide on gene expression in bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood, and on cytokine expression in plasma and bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice. Gene and protein expression were modulated early and transiently by cyclophosphamide, leading to upregulation of a variety of immunomodulatory factors, including danger signals, pattern recognition receptors, inflammatory mediators, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors. These factors are involved in sensing cyclophosphamide myelotoxicity and activating repair mechanisms, which, in turn, stimulate immunoactivation events that promote efficacy. In particular, cyclophosphamide induced a T helper 17 (Th17)-related gene signature associated with an increase in Th17, Th1 and activated CD25+CD4+Foxp3- T lymphocytes and a slight recovery of regulatory T-cells.

Although homeotic transformation, observed in Cdx2-null embryos, was absent in mutant adults, gene expression and cell morphology were vitally compromised. Lethality was accelerated in mice lacking both Cdx2 and its homolog Cdx1, with exaggeration of defects in crypt cell replication and enterocyte differentiation. Cdx2 occupancy correlated with hundreds of transcripts that fell but not with equal numbers that rose with Cdx loss, indicating a predominantly activating role at intestinal cis-regulatory regions.

Animal models have successfully demonstrated that maternal diet could contribute to some of adult diseases. Undernutrition is perceived harmful in pregnant women whereas calorie restriction is a strategy proven to extend healthy and maximum life span in adult. This diagrammatically opposite effect of nutritional condition might provide us hints to search for genes underlying health conditions. Here, we have initiated a study examining the effect of undernutrition on maternal and fetal livers, utilizing high-throughput DNA microarray analysis for screening genome-wide changes in their transcriptomes. Briefly, pregnant mice were exposed to food deprivation (FD) on gestation day (GD) 17, and caesarean section was performed on GD18. Control mice were supplied with chow ad libitum till sacrifice. Total RNA extracted from mother and fetal livers for each control and treatment (FD) was analyzed with an Agilent mouse whole genome DNA chip. Total of 3058 and 3126 up (>1.5 fold)- and down (<0.75 fold)-regulated genes, and 1475 and 1225 up- (>1.5 fold)- and down (<0.75 fold)-regulated genes showed differential expression at the mRNA level, in the maternal and fetal livers, respectively. Interestingly, 103 genes up-regulated in mother were down-regulated in fetus, whereas 108 down-regulated maternal genes were up-regulated in fetus; these 211 genes are potential candidates related to longevity or health. The role of some of these genes, in context of the proposed mechanisms for developmental origins of health and disease is discussed. Comparison between mouse control and FD livers in fetus and mother was performed. Five to ten biological replicates were used, and pooled total RNA from each condition (control and FD) was dye-swaped. .. total RNA;  Control Cy3;  Control Cy5;  FD Cy3;  FD Cy5;  C57BL/6J;  fetus;  mother;  10090;  Mus musculus;  liver;  control;  food deprivation;  FD;  control;

We present evidence that this variation is caused in part by recurrent, pervasive molecular differences between tumors. mRNA expression profiles measured using microdissected PDA clinical samples reveal three dominant subtypes of disease; epithelial, mesenchymal and acinar-like. The classical and quasi-mesenchymal subtypes are observed in human and mouse PDA cell lines. Importantly, responses to cytotoxics and KRAS depletion in human PDA cell lines differ substantially between subtypes, and in opposing directions. Integrated genomics implicate and functional studies support overexpression of the trancription factor GATA6 as a driver of the epithelial subtype. These results provide a molecular framework for evaluating the prospects of personalized treatment in PDA.

Genome-wide association studies in humans have linked genes involved in Th17 cell differentiation and function with susceptibility to Crohn   s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis1-3. Thus, the pathway towards differentiation of Th17 cells and, perhaps, of related innate lymphoid cells with similar effector functions4, 5, is an attractive target for therapeutic applications. Mouse and human Th17 cells are distinguished by expression of the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor ROR  t, which is required for induction of IL-17 transcription and for the manifestation of Th17-dependent autoimmune disease in mice6. By performing a chemical screen with an insect cell-based reporter system, we identified the cardiac glycoside digoxin as a specific inhibitor of ROR  t transcriptional activity. Digoxin inhibited murine Th17 cell differentiation without affecting differentiation of other T cell lineages and was effective in delaying the onset and reducing the severity of autoimmune disease in mice.  At high concentrations, digoxin is toxic for human cells, but non-toxic synthetic derivatives, 20,22-dihydrodigoxin-21,23-diol (Dig(dhd)) and digoxin-21-salicylidene (Dig(sal)), specifically inhibited induction of IL-17 in human CD4+ T cells.  Using these small molecule compounds, we demonstrated that ROR  t is imporant for the maintenance of IL-17 expression in mouse and human effector T cells. These data suggest that derivatives of digoxin can be used as chemical probes for development of ROR  t-targeted therapeutic agents that attenuate inflammatory lymphocyte function and autoimmune disease. We performed gene expression profiling with total RNA samples isolated from DMSO- or digoxin-treated wildtype or ROR  t-deficient cells cultured in Th17 conditions.

To investigate synergy between these tumor suppressors in mice, we induced various combinations of compound deletions conditionally in astrocytes and neural precursors in the mature brain.  The resulting highly penetrant astrocytomas showed a spectrum of histopathological variation reminiscent of human tumors, and ranged from grade III to grade IV (glioblastoma). Secondary somatic mutations varied depending on the combination of initiating deletions and were relevant to human disease. Receptor tyrosine kinase amplifications were frequent in tumors initiated by combined conditional deletion of Pten and Tp53, but not when Rb, Pten and Tp53 were simultaneously deleted. Multiple mutations within PI3K and Rb pathways were acquired, however, Mapk activation was not consistently detected in astrocytomas.  Gene expression profiling revealed striking similarities to previously described human astrocytoma subclasses.  A subset of astrocytomas initiated outside of proliferative niches in the adult brain.

Misregulation of this pathway is thought to initiate colon adenoma formation. It is controversial whether Tcf4 (Tcf7L2) functions as an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene in colon carcinogenesis. We show here that Tcf4 haploinsufficiency results in colon tumor formation in a mouse tumor model that normally only develops small intestinal tumors. Further, we show that loss of Tcf4 early in development and in adult colon results in increased cell proliferation. These findings strongly suggest that Tcf4 normally modulates proliferation of the colonic epithelium and that disruption of Tcf4 activity increases proliferation leading to colon tumorigenesis.

Chronic inflammation and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 are considered tumor-promoting. In contrast, the exact nature of protective antitumor immunity remains obscure. In this study, we have quantified locally secreted cytokines during primary immune responses against myeloma and B-cell lymphoma in mice. Strikingly, successful cancer immunosurveillance mediated by tumor-specific CD4+ T cells was consistently associated with elevated local levels of both proinflammatory (IL-1aplha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) and T helper 1 (Th1)-associated cytokines (interferon-alpha, IL-2, IL-12). Cancer eradication was achieved by a collaboration between tumor-specific Th1 cells and tumor-infiltrating, antigen-presenting macrophages. Th1 cells induced secretion of IL-1? and IL-6 by macrophages. Th1-derived interferon-? was shown to render macrophages directly cytotoxic to cancer cells, and to induce macrophages to secrete the angiostatic chemokines CXCL9/MIG and CXCL10/IP-10. Thus, inflammation, when driven by tumor-specific Th1 cells, may prevent rather than promote cancer.

By integrating fear phenotypes, transcript profiling data from hippocampus and striatum and genotype information, two gene co-expression networks correlated with context-dependent immobility were identified.  We prioritized the key markers and genes in these pathways using intramodular connectivity measures and structural equation modeling.  We mapped 27 behavioral quantitative trait loci with a false discovery rate of 5%.  We also identified two gene co-expression networks correlated with context-dependent immobility. Highly connected genes in the context fear modules included Psmd6, Ube2a and Usp33, suggesting an important role for ubiquitination in learning and memory.

Approximately 2,000 phosphorylations were identified in CTLs of which approximately 450 were controlled by TCR signaling. A significantly overrepresented group of molecules identified in the phosphoproteomic screen were transcription activators, co-repressors and chromatin regulators. A focus on the chromatin regulators revealed that CTLs have high expression of the histone deacetylase HDAC7 but continually phosphorylate and export this transcriptional repressor from the nucleus. HDAC7 dephosphorylation results in its nuclear accumulation and suppressed expression of genes encoding key cytokines, cytokine receptors and adhesion molecules that determine CTL function. The screening of the CTL phosphoproteome thus reveals intrinsic pathways of serine-threonine phosphorylation that target chromatin regulators in CTLs and determine the  CTL functional program. We used Affymetrix microarray analysis to explore the molecular basis for the role of HDAC7 in CTLs and the impact of GFP-HDAC7 phosphorylation deficient mutant expression on the CTL transcriptional profile. In vitro generated P14 TCR cytotoxic T cells were retrovirally infected with a construct encoding GFP-HDAC7 phosphorylation deficient mutant, sorted in base of GFP expression (GFP positive and GFP negative) and processed for microarray analysis in three biological replicas. ..

In contrast, microRNA responses to invasive bacteria have remained unknown. Here, we report cell type-dependent microRNA regulations upon infection of mammalian cells with the enteroinvasive pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium. Murine macrophages strongly up-regulate NF-  B associated microRNAs; strikingly, these regulations which are induced by the bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) occur and persist regardless of successful host invasion and/or replication, or whether an inflammatory response is mounted, suggesting that microRNAs belong to the first line of anti-bacterial defence. However, a suppression of the global immune regulator miR-155 in endotoxintolerant macrophages revealed that microRNA responses also depend on the status of infected cells. This study identifies the let-7 family as the common denominator of Salmonella regulated microRNAs in macrophages and epithelial cells, and suggests that repression of let-7 relieves cytokine IL-6 and IL-10 mRNAs from negative post-transcriptional control. Our results establish a paradigm of microRNA-mediated feed-forward activation of inflammatory factors when mammalian cells are targeted by bacterial pathogens. The murine macrophage cell-line RAW 264.7 was exposed to wild-type Salmonella typhimurium SL1344 or to the corresponding knockout strain lacking both major genomic loci associated with Salmonella pathogenicity ("SPI1" and "SPI2"). To induce infectivity overnight cultures of Salmonella were dilluted 1:100 and grown to OD2. Host cells at a density of approximately 10e6 per well of a 6-well plate were infected at an MOI of 1. Upon initial incubation for 30 min cells were further incubated for 24 h in RPMI supplemented with gentamicin (10   g / ml). As determined by a gentamicin protection and plating assay the SPI1/2 double knockout strain is deficient in both invasion and intracellular replication.We compared mouse mRNA abundances between cells infected with wild-type ("24WT") or SPI1/2 knockout Salmonella ("24SPI1/2") and non-infected, mock-treated controls ("24C"). Both strains mounted a similar inflammatory response as judged from the abundance of pro-inflammatory genes compared to the controls. These data indicate, that macrophages can mount a full inflammatory response to extracellular bacteria, that is not further enhanced or attenuated by the sensing of intracellular bacteria.Murine RAW 264.7 cells were rendered endotoxin-tolerant by pre-exposure to heat-killed Salmonella typhimurium SL1344 ("HKS") at an MOI of 10 for 20 h. 5 days upon removal of the HKS stimulus cells were exposed to wild-type Salmonella typhimurium SL1344 or to the corresponding knockout strain lacking both major genomic loci associated with Salmonella pathogenicity ("SPI1" and "SPI2"). To induce infectivity overnight cultures of Salmonella were dilluted 1:100 and grown to OD2. Host cells at a density of approximately 10e6 per well of a 6-well plate were infected at an MOI of 1. Upon initial incubation for 30 min cells were further incubated for 24 h in RPMI supplemented with gentamicin (10   g / ml). As determined by a gentamicin protection and plating assay the SPI1/2 double knockout strain is deficient in both invasion and intracellular replication. The wild-type Salmonella strain invades and replicates in endotoxin-tolerant RAW 264.7 cells, though the intracellular replication rate is significantly reduced (by roughly 40 %) compared to naive RAW 264.7 cells.We compared mouse mRNA abundances between cells infected with wild-type ("wt") and non-infected, mock-treated controls ("Mock") or between wild-type ("wt") and SPI1/2-knockout ("SPI1/2") infected cells. As apparent from the Microarray data the wild-type Salmonella strain induces a typical inflamatory response in endotoxin-tolerant RAW 264.7 cells (as judged from the fold-induction of NFkB-inducible genes). As expected however, mRNAs corresponding to known inflammatory genes are significantly less abundant in response to the non-invasive SPI1/2 knockout strain, compared to wild-type infection. These data indicate, that endotoxin-tolerance renders macrophages largely insensitive to extracellular, but not to intracellular bacteria.***This submission represents the mRNA component of the study ..

Gene expression in four tissues that have been associated with obesity-related metabolic complications: white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle, the liver, and the heart were examined.  Data suggest that some tissues may be attempting to reduce the metabolic perturbations that occur in the early stages of obesity. Also, many identified genes were associated with a variety of disorders, thereby serving as potential links between obesity and related health risks. After 3 wk of weaning, male C57BL/6J littermates were randomly separated into control (n=6) and treatment (n=6) groups for each tissue. After an acclimatization period of 1wk, animals were given free access to a chow diet (23% protein, 21% fat, and 55% carbohydrate) or a high fat (HF) diet (15% protein, 59% fat, and 26% carbohydrate) for 20wk. Following the feeding period, animals were fasted for 6h, anesthetized with pentobarbital, and weighed. Blood glucose was assessed in anesthetized mice. Non-esterified fatty acids and immunoreactive insulin was assayed with a double antibody method. Samples of WAT, the liver, gastrocnemius muscle and heart were obtained, frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80oC until subsequent use.

Little is known about the mechanisms regulating EMT or the in vivo signals directing epicardial-derived cell (EPDC) fate.

Our previous study identified the miR-29 family, three paralogous species of miR-29a/b/c, as the most predominantly expressed small RNA in aged mouse brain compared to the neonate one. Mouse brain miR-29 is highly astrocytic. Its expression is quiescent during early brain development, and then steadily increases to a plateau state around reproductive maturity. To explore the functional relevance of miR-29 expression in early life to the neural physiology of the mouse brain from the mechanistic perspective of mammalian species-specific lifespan, we here undertook a gain-of-function approach through exogenous expression of miR-29 in astrocyte from mouse fetus and surveyed the resulting alteration in both the transcriptional and translational levels. DNA microarray analyses retrieved a total of 5,589 genes showing temporal significant expression changes in the miR-29-transfected fetal astrocytes, and classified them into two gene groups: positively or negatively regulated by miR-29. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantification of translational products of miR-29-responsive genes identified 18 species of miR-29 target candidates. We performed functional enrichment analyses utilizing bioinformatics resources to characterize the gene sets thus identified, and found their expression trend that favor the processes for facilitating cell differentiation while supporting normal cell proliferation /survival, which is somewhat different from the functional signatures of miR-29 as observed at adult stages, implying a pleiotropic property of miR-29 depending on the developmental context. Our present results strongly suggest that miR-29 in the developing mouse brain serves as the central coordinator to shift the global gene expression toward adult phenotypes, through which ensure the programmed transition in the life course to the post-developmental/reproductive stage which has inherently been set to delimit the mouse life potential. DNA microarray experiment: Sample labeling, hybridization and washing were performed following the standard protocol detailed in the Agilent One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis ver.5.7. Briefly, a One-color Spike-Mix was diluted 1000-fold and a 5-  l aliquot of the diluted mix were added to every 0.5   g of total RNA samples (three each of extraction replicates of miR-29-treated sample and control sample named elsewhere) prior to labeling reaction. The labeling reaction was carried out separately for the RNA samples using a Quick Amp Labeling Kit one-color, in the presence of cyanine 3-CTP. The dye-labeled target (1.6   g as cRNA) was fragmented and hybridized on an Agilent Whole Mouse Genome 4X44K microarray at 65  C for 17 hr with a Gene Expression Hybridization Kit. The hybridized slide was washed in Gene Expression Wash Buffer 1 at room temperature for 1 min, which was followed by a wash for 1 min in Gene Expression Wash Buffer 2. The processed microarrays were scanned using an Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner. Data extraction from raw image files was done with Agilent Feature Extraction software ver.10.7. .. embryonic day 18;  astrocyte, primary culture;  total RNA;  mus musculus fetal astrocyte, control-transfected;  mus musculus fetal astrocyte, miR-29-transfected;  C57BL/6;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Astrocytes were transfected in six-well plates (AGC Techno Glass, Japan) containing the medium supplemented with 80 nM each of miR-29 (Ambion Pre-miR hsa-miR-29a/b/c Precursors) or control miRNA (Ambion Pre-miR Negative Control1) using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) in accordance with manufacturer?s protocols. miR-29 RNA for the transfection was prepared by mixing the three miR-29 isoforms in a 1:2:1 molar ratio of Pre-miR-29a:-29b:-29c Precursors. The transfection was conducted three weeks after the initial plating. 48 hr posttransfection, cells were harvested and processed for preparation of RNA samples. The transfection efficiency was above 90% as determined using a fluorochrome-conjugated miR-29 precursor (TAKARA BIO, Japan). RNA extraction was performed in triplicate for each cell type.

Previous data indicated that many of the functions of Foxp3 are controlled by the acetylation of several lysines within the forkhead domain. We now show that mutation of each of two lysines within the forkhead domain of Foxp3, lysine at position 382 (K17) and lysine at position 393 (K18), impaired Treg suppressive function in vivo and in vitro. Lysine mutations also decreased Treg expression of multiple functionally important Foxp3-regulated genes, and inhibited the promoter remodeling of target genes (CTLA-4 and IL-2) without affecting Foxp3 expression level. These data point to the need for a further understanding of the effects of various post-translational modifications on Foxp3 function. Our studies also provide a rationale for developing small molecule inhibitors of such post-translational modifications so as to regulate Foxp3+ Treg function clinically.

Background: Our laboratory is interested in the role of oxidative stress in aging and human disease. Currently, a major focus of our efforts is the characterization of a murine hemolytic anemia resulting from oxidative stress, a model for the human disorder Sideroblastic Anemia. This model is based upon transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from mice that are deficient in the antioxidant protein SOD2 (Friedman J. Exp. Med. 2001 193:925). SOD2 protects against the cytotoxicity of mitochondrial superoxide produced as a byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation (Weisiger J. Biol. Chem. 1973 248:4793). In characterization of the model to date, we have focused upon RBC proteomic analysis to identify 41 proteins differentially expressed when comparing membrane and soluble RBC fractions from SOD2-/- vs. SOD2+/+ mice (Friedman et al. submitted). In addition, we have characterized the in vivo response of animals to a novel catalytic antioxidant (Euk-189) that has b! oth SOD and catalase activities. In addition to proteins involved in mitochondrial function and stress response we find a number of cell surface molecules with significant differential expression. Thrombospondin is found at higher levels in SOD2-/- red cell membrane fractions. This is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and migration that interacts with glycosaminoglycans (especially the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan) expressed at the endothelial cell surface (Feitsma J. Biol. Chem. 2000 275:9396, Vischer Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 1997 73:332, Sun J. Biol. Chem. 1989 15:2885). Thrombospondin is likely an acquired surface molecule on our red cells, which is of interest as this molecule has been found on the surface of sickle red cells and appears to mediate abnormal adhesion of red cells to vessel wall (Hillery Blood 1996 87:4879, Sugihara Blood 1992 15:2634). CD44 is also found at higher levels in SOD2-/- membrane fractions. CD44 is an adhesion receptor for the high molecular weight polysaccharide hyaluronic acid and has been shown recently to be involved in the trafficking of stem cells to the bone marrow (Avigdor Blood January 2004). Higher expression of these molecules on the surface of SOD2-/- red cells may affect their adhesive interactions with vascular endothelium and may in part explain the early removal of these cells from the circulation  resulting in the observed hemolytic anemia. Some proteins that accumulate on the surface of SOD2 deficient red cells are likely molecular damage sensors, binding to surfaces altered by oxidative damage. The role of specific glycoproteins in such binding remains to be elucidated. Additional surface proteins from red cells show differential expression, many of which are also glycosylated.Planned Experiment: As the next step in characterization of the anemia model, we will compare the gene expression profile of red cell progenitors isolated from Sod2-/- and Sod2+/+ animals. We have defined cell-sorting conditions for isolation of erythroid progenitor cells from marrow of our mice. .. female;  TER-119 CD71 erythroid progenitor cells;  Anemic;  Healthy;  KO SOD -/-;  wild type SOD+/+;  total RNA;  TER-119 CD71 erythroid cells Sod 2 Knock Out;  TER-119 CD71 erythroid progenitor cells from wild type cells;  10090;  Mus musculus;

Yet, TDG was also observed to attack 5-methycytosine itself, making it a candidate DNA demethylase, and interactions with transcription factors implicated additional functions in gene regulation. Unlike other DNA glycosylases, TDG is essential for embryonic development. Fibroblasts from Tdg null embryos show massively impaired gene regulation, and this correlates with imbalanced histone modification and CpG methylation. TDG associates with the promoters of affected genes in MEFs and in embryonic stem cells, but epigenetic aberrations appear only in differentiated cells. TDG also contributes to the maintenance of active and bivalent chromatin during cell differentiation, using its DNA glycosylase activity to counter aberrant de novo methylation. Thus, TDG dependent DNA repair stabilizes epigenetic states during cell differentiation. Comparison of 3 Tdg+/- MEF replicates with 3 Tdg-/- MEF replicates.

Wnt/  -catenin signaling is a known oncogenic pathway that plays a well defined role in colon and skin cancer but its role in lung cancer remains unclear. We show that activation of Wnt/  -catenin in the bronchiolar epithelium of the adult lung does not promote tumor development by itself. However, activation of Wnt/  - catenin signaling leads to a dramatic increase in tumor formation both in overall tumor number and size compared to KrasG12D alone. We show that activation of Wnt/  - catenin signaling significantly alters the KrasG12D tumor phenotype resulting in a phenotypic switch from bronchiolar epithelium to the highly proliferative distal progenitors found in the embryonic lung. This is associated with a decrease in E- cadherin expression at the cell surface which may increase metastasis in Wnt/  -catenin signaling positive tumors. Together, these data suggest that activation of Wnt/  -catenin signaling in combination with other oncogenic pathways in lung epithelium may lead to a more aggressive phenotype due to the imposition of an embryonic distal progenitor phenotype accompanied by decreased E-cadherin expression. We performed microarray analysis of control murine lung, CC10-cre:KrasG12D, and CC10-cre:Ctnnb1ex3flox:LSL-KrasG12D double mutant micro-dissected murine lung tumors to determine their transcriptional phenotype.

We have hypothesized that the stromal compartment plays a pivotal role in the acquisition of the hormone-independent (HI) phenotype by providing stimulatory factors that replace the proliferative effects of the hormone. Methods: We used DNA microarrays to compare the gene expression profiles of tumors from the MPA mouse breast cancer model, one hormone-dependent (C4-HD) and one hormone-independent (C4-HI), using whole tumor samples or laser-captured purified stromal and epithelial cells obtained from the same tumors. The expression of selected genes was validated by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assays.  Results: We identified 413 genes that were expressed in tumor stroma but not in epithelial cells. Eighty-five percent of these genes were upregulated, whereas the remaining 15% were downregulated in C4-HI tumors relative to their expression in the C4-HD tumor stroma. Several matrix metallopeptidases, including Mmp13, Mmp3, Mmp10 and Mmp9, were overexpressed in the C4-HI tumor microenvironment. On the other hand, 1100 genes were specifically expressed in the tumor parenchyma. Among them, the 29% were upregulated, whereas the remaining 71% were downregulated, in C4-HI relative to C4-HD tumor epithelium. Steap, Pdgfc, Runx2, Cxcl9 and Sdf2 were among the genes with high expression in the C4-HI tumor parenchyma. Interestingly, we found that Fgf2 was one of the few genes upregulated by MPA in C4-HD tumors, confirming its pivotal role in regulating tumor growth in this model. Conclusions: We demonstrate a gene expression profile that distinguishes epithelial from stromal cells in mammary tumors with different hormone dependence. Our results support the hypothesis that the tumor-associated stroma may contribute to hormone-independent tumor growth. The fact that Fgf2 was one of these few stimulatory genes is worth investigating.  reference X sample .. total RNA;  BALB_C4-HD2_1_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HD2_2_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HD_(2)_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HD_(3)_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HD_(4)_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HD_2_EPI_LCM;  BALB_C4-HD_2_FIB_LCM;  BALB_C4-HD_3_EPI_LCM;  BALB_C4-HD_3_FIB_LCM;  BALB_C4-HD_4_EPI_LCM;  BALB_C4-HD_4_FIB_LCM;  BALB_C4-HD_sMPA_(1)_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HD_sMPA_(2)_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HD_sMPA_1_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HD_sMPA_2_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HI_(2)_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HI_(3)_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HI_(4)_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HI_1_1_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HI_1_2_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HI_2_1_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HI_2_2_LANARI;  BALB_C4-HI_2_EPI_LCM;  BALB_C4-HI_2_FIB_LCM;  BALB_C4-HI_3_EPI_LCM;  BALB_C4-HI_3_FIB_LCM;  BALB_C4-HI_4_EPI_LCM;  BALB_C4-HI_4_FIB_LCM;  Mouse Reference;  BALB/c;  10090;  Mus musculus;  laser captured epithelial tumor cells;  laser captured tumor stroma;  mammary tumor;  whole mouse total RNA;  MPA pellet removed 48 hrs prior to sacrifice;  MPA treatment;

Results show that hTNF/SphK1-/- have significantly less severity and progression of arthritis and bone erosions as measured through micro-CT images.  Additionally, less COX-2 protein, mTNF   transcript levels and fewer Th 17 cells were detected in the joints of hTNF/SphK1-/- compared to hTNF/SphK1+/+ mice.  Microarray analysis of the ankle joint showed that hTNF/SphK1-/- mice have increased transcript levels of IL-6 and SOCS3 compared to hTNF/SphK1+/+ mice.  Finally, fewer mature osteoclasts were detected in the ankle joints of hTNF/SphK1-/- mice compared to hTNF/SphK1+/+ mice.  These data show that SphK1 plays a role in hTNF   induced inflammatory arthritis, potentially through a novel pathway involving IL-6 and SOCS3.

Autosomal-dominant OPMD is caused by a short (GCG)8   13 expansions within the first exon of the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 gene (PABPN1), leading to an expanded polyalanine tract in the mutated protein. Expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble aggregates in the nuclei of skeletal muscle fibres. In order to gain insight into the different physiological processes affected in OPMD muscles, we have used a transgenic mouse model of OPMD (A17.1) and performed transcriptomic studies combined with a detailed phenotypic characterization of this model at three time points. The transcriptomic analysis revealed a massive gene deregulation in the A17.1 mice, among which we identified a significant deregulation of pathways associated with muscle atrophy. Using a mathematical model for progression, we have identified that one-third of the progressive genes were also associated with muscle atrophy. Functional and histological analysis of the skeletal muscle of this mouse model confirmed a severe and progressive muscular atrophy associated with a reduction in muscle strength. Moreover, muscle atrophy in the A17.1 mice was restricted to fast glycolytic fibres, containing a large number of intranuclear inclusions (INIs). The soleus muscle and, in particular, oxidative fibres were spared, even though they contained INIs albeit to a lesser degree. These results demonstrate a fibre-type specificity of muscle atrophy in this OPMD model. This study improves our understanding of the biological pathways modified in OPMD to identify potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets. A17.1 transgenic mice have previously been described. Male A17.1 mice and WT controls were generated by crossing the heterozygous carrier strain A17.1 obtained from Rubinsztein's group with the FvB background mice. The mice were genotyped by PCR 3   4 weeks after birth. Wild type FvB and A17.1 mice were housed in minimal disease facilities (Royal Holloway, University of London) with food and water ad libitum.Total RNA was extracted from skeletal muscles using RNA Bee (Amsbio) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

One important but often overlooked component of wound repair is mechanical force, which regulates reciprocal cell-matrix interactions through focal adhesion components including focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1,2. Here we report that FAK is activated following cutaneous injury and that this activation is potentiated by mechanical loading. Transgenic mice lacking fibroblast-specific FAK exhibit significantly less fibrosis in a preclinical model of HTS formation. Inflammatory pathways involving monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), a chemokine highly implicated in human skin fibrosis3, are triggered following FAK activation, mechanistically linking physical force to fibrosis. Further, small molecule inhibition of FAK effectively abrogates fibroproliferative mechanisms in human cells and significantly reduces scar formation in vivo. Collectively, these findings establish a molecular basis for HTS formation based on the mechanical activation of fibroblast-specific FAK and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeted mechanomodulatory strategies. Wildtype murine tissue was harvested at either day 6 or 14 post-injury following 48 hours or 10 days of mechanical loading, respectively (n=4 mice per group per time point). Murine RNA was isolated, labeled, and hybridized to the GeneChip microarray according to the manufacturer   s protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

Gpx1 is the most abundant isoform and its role has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson   s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies tissue (DLB) (Power and Blumbergs, 2009) and traumatic brain injury (Tsuru-Aoyagi et al., 2009). Due to its high abundance, mutation of the Gpx1 allele would lower overall Gpx activity in the brain significantly. Gpx1 knockout (Gpx1-/-) mice do not show overt phenotypic differences, but all indications suggest that these mice are in a chronic    pro-oxidant    state (Cheng et al. 1999; de Haan et al. 2004). Indeed, a recent study from our laboratory illustrated that the absence of Gpx1 exacerbated stroke injury via increased ROS production and vascular permeability (Wong et al. 2008). Furthermore, Gpx1-/- mice demonstrated an increase in caspase-3 activation and greater infarct volume (Crack et al. 2001) Microarray analysis was performed on the right striatum and cortex(corresponded to infarct area) of post-I/R injured brain tissues of Gpx1 -/- brains using Illumina mouse Ref8 V2 genechips. Suture-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced for 2h followed by reperfusion, with tissue extraction taking place 2h, 8h and 24h post-reperfusion (n=4 respectively).

Reduction in cerebral blood flow upon intraluminal suture insertion was confirmed with laser Doppler. Control sham animals were subjected to the initial anesthetic and neck incision only. All animals were put back onto a 37?C heat pad post-surgery to recover from anesthesia. After 2-hour of ischemic period, the animals underwent reperfusion by withdrawal of the suture under anesthetic condition and return onto the heat pad until euthanized at the designated time-points of 2, 8 or 24 hours.;

We hypothesized that nutritional programming is a variable quantitative state of gene expression, fixed by the state of energy balance in the neonate, that waxes and wanes in the adult animal in response to changes in energy balance. We tested this hypothesis with an experiment, based upon global gene expression, to identify networks of genes in which expression patterns in inguinal fat of mice have been altered by the nutritional environment during early post-natal development. Gene expression patterns in inguinal fat was assessed at 5, 10, 21 days of age and as adults fed chow (56 days of age) followed by high fat diet for 8 weeks (112 days of age) for C57BL/6J mice reared by lactating dams fed either a control diet (CONT), lactating dams fed a diet in which food intake was restricted to cause under-nourishment (lactation under-nutrition; LUN); and, lactating dams fed a high fat diet in where the number of progeny was limited to four (lactation over-nutrition; LON) . 15 samples with 3 technical replicates of each sample.

Abstract Background and Purpose- Although the therapeutic potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells (SC) has been addressed in different experimental models of ischemic stroke, it is still unclear how SC induce neuroprotection following stroke. In this study, we describe a novel method for recovering SC infiltrating post-stroke brain tissue allowing the determination of  genes which become persistently activated / or depressed (compared to their na  ve counterparts) during SC-mediated neuroprotection. Methods- Ischemic stroke was induced in C57BL/6 mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 h, followed by reperfusion. SC were isolated from H-2Kb-tsA58 (immortomouseTM) mice, and were administered (i.v.) 24 h after reperfusion. At the onset of therapeutic improvement (14 days after ischemia), infarcted brain tissue was isolated and infarct-infiltratng SC cultured at 33  C. Microarray analysis and RT-PCR were performed to compare persistent differential gene expression between na  ve  and infiltrating SC populations. Results- Z-scoring revealed dramatic changes in extracellular genes of analyzed cells. Pair-wise analysis detected 80 extracellular factor genes that were up-regulated (  2 fold, P<0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg correction) between na  ve and infiltrated SC. Although several conventional neuroregenerative, nerve guidance and angiogenic factors (bFGF, bone morphogenetic protein, angiopoietins, neural growth factors were among the expressed genes detected  we identified Cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (Crlf1), Fgf7, family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (Fam19a5), Glypican 1 (Gpc1), Dickkopf homolog 2 (Dkk2), Endothelial cell-specific molecule 1, Osteopontin (OPN)35, Tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2, Masp3 mRNA for MBL-associated serine protease-3, Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf), Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2), Olfactomedin 1, Sushi-repeat-containing protein, X-linked 2 (Srpx2). Conclusions- SC infiltrating the post-i  schemic brain assume a persistently altered pattern of expressed extracellular genes compared to na  ve SC that contributes to neuroprotection, regeneration and angiogenesis in infarcts.

Analysis of this genetic architecture can identify single genes and whole pathways that influence to complex traits including inflammation and cancer susceptibility. Changes in the genetic architecture during the development of benign and malignant tumours have not been investigated. Here, we document major changes in germline control of gene expression during skin tumour development as a consequence of cell selection, somatic genetic events, and changes in tumour microenvironment. Immune response genes such as Interleukin 18 and Granzyme E are under germline control in tumours but not in normal skin. Gene expression networks linked to tumour susceptibility and hair follicle stem cell markers in normal skin undergo significant reorganization during tumour progression. Our data highlight opposing roles of Interleukin-1 signaling networks in tumour susceptibility and tumour progression and have implications for the development of chemopreventive strategies to reduce cancer incidence. Skin tumors were induced on dorsal back skin from a Mus spretus / Mus musculus backcross ([SPRET/Ei X FVB/N] X FVB/N) mice by treatment of dorsal back skin with dimethyl benzanthracene (DMBA) and tetradecanoyl-phorbol acetate (TPA).

Using BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors purified by a new technique, we demonstrate that glucocorticoids stimulate the earliest (BFU-E) progenitors to undergo limited self-renewal, which increases formation of CFU-E cells > 20-fold. Interestingly, glucocorticoids induce expression of genes in BFU-E cells that contain promoter regions highly enriched for hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF1a) binding sites. This suggests activation of HIF1a may enhance or replace the effect of glucocorticoids on BFU-E self-renewal. Indeed, HIF1a activation by a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (PHI) synergizes with glucocorticoids and enhances production of CFU-Es 170-fold. Since PHIs are able to increase erythroblast production at very low concentrations of glucocorticoids, PHI-induced stimulation of BFU-E progenitors thus represents a conceptually new therapeutic window for treating Epo-resistant anemia.

It does so by binding to a receptor in renal collecting duct cells, triggering signaling pathways that ultimately regulate the abundance, location, and activity of the water channel protein aquaporin 2.  We took an advantage of quantitative large scale proteomic technologies and oligonucleotide microarrays to quantify steady state changes in protein and transcript abundances in response to vasopressin in a collecting duct cell line, mpkCCD clone 11 (Yu et al. PNAS 2009, 106:2441-2446).  This cell line originally developed by Alan Vandewalle   s group recapitulates vasopressin-mediated AQP2 expression and phosphorylation as seen in native colleting duct cells. The mpkCCD cells were grown on membrane supports to permit polarization.  Once transepithelial resistance reached 5kohm per centimeter square and higher, the cells were exposed to the vasopressin V2 receptor analog, dDAVP, at a physiological concentration, 0.1nM, for 5 days.  Control experiments were done with cells exposed to vehicle alone.  Total RNA was harvested and processed for transcript expression analysis using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays.  Each experimental treatment, vehicle and dDAVP, was repeated 3 times. .. mpkCCD clone 11;  mouse kidney cortical collecting duct cells;  total RNA;  mpkCCD clone 11 cells;  10090;  Mus musculus;  Once transepithelial resistance reached 5kohm per centimeter square and higher, the cells were exposed to the vasopressin V2 receptor analog, dDAVP, at a physiological concentration, 0.1nM, for 5 days.
